<h3>Drawing Tools Plugin Help</h3><br>
--------------------------<br><br>
This plugin provides a set of <b>drawing tools</b> which allows you to 
rapidly draw, modify and erase contours. To use these tools make sure 
3dmod is on <i>"Model"</i> mode, the <i>"Drawing Tools"</i> 
plugin window is open and you've selected the <i>"Draw Mode"</i> 
you wish to use.
Notice in the Zap window that many of the tools use a red
<b>"sculpt circle"</b>, the size of which can be changed using mouse
wheel or the keys [q] and [w].

<br>
<b>List of Drawing Modes</b><br>
--------------------------<br><br>
<ol>
<li><b>Normal</b> - lets you use normal contour drawing behavior.</li>
<li><b>Sculpt</b> - lets you quickly draw contours by holding the point 
addition mouse button <i>[second_button]</i> and pushing the contour 
outwards or inwards with the sculpt circle. Holding down <i>[shift]</i> 
as well lets you will pinch contours toward the center instead.</li>
<li><b>Join</b> - is similar to Sculpt, but also allows you to merge 
two contours by pushing one contour over another or split a contour 
by pushing a gap through the middle. Using [thrid_button] lets 
you join or split contours using a rectangle. </li>
<li><b>Transform</b> - allows you to move <i>[second_button]</i>, 
<i>scale [third_button]</i>, rotate <i>[shift+second_button]</i> or 
stretch <i>[shift+third_button]</i> the currently selected contour.</li>
<li><b>Eraser</b> - allows you to delete contours <i>[second_button]</i> 
or points <i>[third_button]</i> touching the sculpt circle. 
Holding <i>[shift+third_button]</i> lets you break apart contours.</li>
<li><b>Warp</b> - allows you to quickly correct bad regions of contour
by warping <i>[second_button]</i> or warp-and-smoothing <i>[third_button]</i>
the contour points closest to (if you click on a contour) or within (if you 
click near a contour) the sculpt circle.
Holding <i>[shift+third_button]</i> lets you break apart contours.</li>
<li><b>Curve</b> - allows you to draw a smooth contour by clicking a sequence
of points <i>[second_button]</i> and then end the contour by pressing
[space] or connecting the end of the contour to the beginning.</li>
</ol>

<br>
<br>
<b>Tips</b><br>
---------------------<br>
<br>
Holding and dragging <b>[shift+first_button]</b> allows you to quickly
scroll up and down through the slices.<br>
<br>
Be warned that the sculpt and join tool were designed for 2D 
closed contours and so I would not recommend using these tools 
with open or scattered contours which span multiple slices.<br>
<br>
If you select a contour using the "transform" tool, you can
copy it to nearby slices by simply scrolling to a different slice
and mouse clicking [second_button]. In this way transform can
be useful to quickly mark-up simple shapes.
<br>
The join tool and, to a lesser extent, the sculpt tool can become
sluggish for objects with numerous contours. 
To improve performance you should consider adding an extra object and 
then use <i>'edit > object > move'</i> to merge the contours into the 
desired object periodically.<br> 
<br>
Another way to improve performance can be to reduce contours. Use
<b>'Reduce Contour'</b> to reduce the current contours, by selectively
removing points,  or <b>'Reduce Object'</b> to reduce ALL contours
in the current object. Use <b>'Smooth Contour'</b> to smooth the
current contours, by adding points, or <b>'Smooth Object'</b> to
smooth ALL contours in the current object. <br>
Reducing objects can often substantially reduce the number of points in 
the model, but be very careful you don't lose information in
the process.<br>
<br>
Under <b>More Actions</b> are a number of other options to sort, trasform,
move, copy, expand and modify contours.

<br>
In 3dmod (without the drawing tool plugin) there are several 
useful drawing tools you might not know about:
<ol>
<li>You can select multiple contours by holding
[ctrl+first_button].</li>
<li>You can delete points by holding [shift+third_button].</li>
<li>You can transform selected contour(s) by toggling
the Zap "contour transform mode" with [P] - this mode is
similar to the "transform" drawing tool.</li>
</ol>
