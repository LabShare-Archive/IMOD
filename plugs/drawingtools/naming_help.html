<h3>Naming Objects in IMOD</h3><br>
--------------------------<br>
<br>
<h3>Why is it Important to Name Objects Consistently?</h3><br>
<br>
A common problem in segmentation programs, such as IMOD/3dmod, is that 
<b>users often don't know how or forget to provide adequate labeling for 
the structures they segment</b>. All over the world, science/electron 
tomography labs tell the same story of having tens to hundreds of IMOD models 
with object names such as "<i>blue object</i>", "<i>round things</i>" or 
(more commonly) no label at all. Segmentation is usually carried out by 
students who are never taught the importance of labeling objects, who are 
allowed to chose their own colors and who only stay in the lab for a 
short-to-medium time period. Anyone else in the group who opens these 
model files thus has no idea what they're looking at.<br>
<br>
Without a <b>consistent naming system</b> it become very difficult for 
scientists for analyze single models - let alone analyze differences between 
several models by several different people. As a result, such models often 
get disregarded: wether it's poor segmentation or poor labeling no-body wants 
to go back and fix someone else's model, thus if a model is to have a chance 
of being analyzed and reused for publication, it's important the lab trains 
new users to identify, segment and label all objects correctly!<br>

<br>
<h3>How to Name Objects in IMOD</h3>
<br>
To name an object in 3dmod you can simply go: <b>Edit > Object > Type</b> 
then enter a "name", and to change it's color go <b>Edit > Object > Color</b>. 
Making people name objects is only half the battle: the other half is doing 
it right! Even if students have been sufficiently trained to correctly 
identify an organelle, if left to their own devices, multiple students will 
give the same object type different labels and different colors. For example, 
what one student may (accurately) name <i>"Mitochondrial Outer Membrane"</i>, 
others may name "<i>Mitochondria", "mitochondrion", "Mito memb", "MITO23"</i> 
and so on. To reduce these differences, every group should try and build and 
then enforce a set of standard names and colors which can be expressed as a 
simple table. As an example of this, below is an excerpt from a table used to 
segment pancreatic beta cells:<br>

<p>Notice here that:
</p>
<ol><li> all names are in <b>Title Case</b> <i>(i.e. first letter capitalized, 
the rest in lowercase)</i>
</li><li> all names are <b>Singular</b> <i>(eg: "Microtubule" instead of 
"Microtubules", even thought the object is likely to contain many 
microtubules)</i>
</li><li> all these names were taken from the 
<b><a href="http://www.neurolex.org/wiki/Subcellular_Parts_Table" 
title="http://www.neurolex.org/wiki/Subcellular_Parts_Table">NeuroLex 
"Subcellular Parts Table"</a></b>. <i>(to ensure consistency with other 
cell biology groups)</i>
</li></ol>
<p>Your own group can and should build a similar table using standard names 
from your field. Although difficult, it's also a good idea to try and use 
the same ordering of object types across similar models, since most IMOD 
analysis tools (such as mtk) require you to list the object's number. You can 
renumber objects using: <b>Edit &gt; Object &gt; Renumber...</b>.<br>

<br>
<h3>Using the "Name Wizard" Plugin</h3><br>
<br>
To help encourage consistent naming and coloring of objects I created an IMOD 
plugin called "<b>Name Wizard</b>". This plugin works by loading a <b>table 
of standard names and colors</b>, plus optional hyperlinks and unique IDs 
from a CSV (comma separated value) file in the "IMOD_CALIB_DIR" at: 
"<b>/usr/local/standard_names_persistent.csv</b>" or (if this does not exist) 
at in the IMOD_DIR under "<b>$IMOD_DIR/lib/imodplug/standard_names.csv</b>" 
<i>(NOTE: The former file location is preferred because it will not get 
overwritten when IMOD is reinstalled)</i>. By default there are just over 
200 entries which were taken from the 
<a href="http://www.neurolex.org/wiki/Subcellular_Parts_Table" 
title="http://www.neurolex.org/wiki/Subcellular_Parts_Table">
NeuroLex "Subcellular Parts Table"</a>, and you can open these cvs files 
to modify them or create your own entries. In addition to auto-complete, 
this plugin helps rapidly enter and verify that all names match the entries 
in the csv file. There are also options here to manage objects by 
reordering, deleting, merging or splitting. Thus, if you are serious about 
making your group use consistent labels, I recommending installing the same "standard_names_persistent.csv" and installing Name Wizard on all computers 
in your group.
<ul><li> <b>Installation Instructions</b>
<ul><li> Name Wizard was created Jan 2010, so it may take while before it's 
part of the standard IMOD release... in the meantime you can install Name 
Wizard manually by downloading the latest version (which matches your platform) 
from: <a href="ftp://bio3d.colorado.edu/latestIMOD/alpha/plugins/" 
title="ftp://bio3d.colorado.edu/latestIMOD/alpha/plugins/">
ftp://bio3d.colorado.edu/latestIMOD/alpha/plugins/</a>. Copy this file 
+ "standard_names.csv" + "namewizard.html" to your 
<b>$IMOD_CALIB_DIR/plugins/</b> directory, and the next time you start 
3dmod you should be able the see and start the plugin under 
<b>"Special > Name Wizard"</b>. E-mail me at andrew_noske[AT_SIGN]yahoo.com 
if you have any problems.

<h3>Shared Vocabularies and Ontologies</h3><br>
<br>
To ensure proper names are used between groups, cellular biology 
organizations/initiatives such as the "<a href="http://neuinfo.org/" 
title="http://neuinfo.org/">Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF)</a>
" have built large <b>ontologies</b> containing <b>shared vocabularies</b>. 
An ontology is much more than just using standardized names: and ontology is 
"a formal representation of knowledge as a set of concepts with a domain and 
the relationship between those concepts". Effectively it's like a set of 
rules... for example:<br>
<ul><li> <b>Mitochondrial Outer Membrane</b> <i>"is part of"</i> 
<b>Mitochondrion</b>
</li><li> <b>Mitochondrion</b> <i>"is an"</i> <b>Organelle</b>
</li><li> <b>Organelle</b> <i>"is part of"</i> <b>Cell</b>
</li></ul><br>
This tells us where-ever there is an organelle, it must be contained within 
a cell. This information can be very useful for analysis and even in 
segmentation algorithms. Since IMOD can be used over a broad number of 
domains (including material science), it does not contain or enforce any 
ontology rules/logic, however it's still a good idea to be aware of such 
ontologies, and adhere to the most relevant naming conventions.<br>

<br>
<h3>Finding Correct Names for Cellular and Sub-cellular Compartments using 
the NIF Website</h3>
<br>
<p>Although there are (unfortunately) no enforced standards, a good standard 
to use in the field of cellular biology are the 
"<b><a href="http://neuinfo.org/#vocab/" title="http://neuinfo.org/#vocab/">
NIF Vocabularies</a></b>". NIF, an initiative at the University of San Diego 
California, provides the following website interface where you can being 
typing the name of an organelle and an auto-complete feature will suggest 
the appropriate name:
</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.neuinfo.org/nif/" 
title="http://www.neuinfo.org/nif/">NIF's Search Interface</a>
</li></ul>
<p>NIF ontology, they also provide a list of common subcellular compartments 
here:
</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.neurolex.org/wiki/Subcellular_Parts_Table" 
title="http://www.neurolex.org/wiki/Subcellular_Parts_Table">
NeuroLex "Subcellular Parts Table"</a>.
</li></ul>
<p>Clicking on any of these organelles will link to information and often 
pictures of that organelle. Note that each "object" in NeuroLex contains a 
unique identifier. For example 
"<a href="http://www.neurolex.org/wiki/Category:Microtubule_(sao1846835077)" 
title="http://www.neurolex.org/wiki/Category:Microtubule_(sao1846835077)">
Microtubule</a>" has the unique identifier "sao1846835077".
<br>

<br>
<h3>Single Object Per Compartment Type vs. Multiple Objects</h3><br>
<br>
<p>Within IMOD each "Object" contains: <b>many contours</b> and these contours 
are meshed together across the volume to form <b>multiple surfaces</b>. 
Although many groups create a SINGLE object for each type of organelle..... 
other groups prefer to segment each individual organelle (each surface) in a 
new object. When you do this it's still important to name objects consistently, 
and you may also want to add a number to the end, for example:<br>
<br>
<table border="2" bgcolor="#FBFBFF" width="100%" cellspacing="0" 
cellpadding="3" rules="all" style="width: 450px">

<tr bgcolor="#F3F3FF">

</td><td>255
</td></tr></table>
<br>
Notice that an accurate label ("Axon") has been used, and a number suffixed 
to each object, separated by a period. The big drawback of this method is 
that you'll probably end up with a LOT of objects in your model file, and 
each will have to be individually renamed and colored, however there are also 
some advantages to such a method. The pros and cons of having multiple 
objects versus one object per "object type", are summarized in this table:<br>

</th><th>Multiple Objects (one object/surface)
</th></tr>
<tr>
<th>Pros:
</th>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Few objects per model (usually &lt; 10) means it's much easier to 
mange (i.e. to setup/recolor and rename objects).</li>
<li> Don't need to think about what contour belongs to what surface during 
segmentation (useful for convoluted surfaces).</li>
<li>Easy to show/hide whole "layers" at a time.</li>
</ul>
</td>

<h3>Naming Non-Standard Objects in Capitals</h3>
<p>Within IMOD you may often find yourself wanting or needing to create 
objects which don't represent standard 3D structures. For example, you may 
want to create an object with scattered points to show interesting features 
within your tomogram, or an object with open contours to measure distances 
between two types of organelles, or to show section boundaries, and so on. 
For such "non-standard" objects I suggest you use capital letters to make 
them stand out. I've listed some examples of these objects below:
<br>
<br>

<td> <b>POINTS OF INTEREST</b>
</td><td>255 </td><td>0 </td><td>255 </td><td style="background: #FF00FF"> 
purple
</td><td>When segmenting a cellular tomogram it's not uncommon to find 
interesting/unusual features which you want to show other people. To flag 
these interesting areas I recommend creating an object of type 
<b>"scattered points"</b>, which you should call "POINTS OF INTEREST", set 
<i>sphere size</i> to about 20 and <i>points per contor</i> to <b>1</b>. You 
may also want to add a label to each contour (to comment on what you see) by 
going <b>Edit &gt; Contour &gt; Type...</b> then enter a label. Next time your 
supervisor is around you can then use [c] to iterate through these points of 
interest, and see if any are biologically interesting.

<i>object type</i> to <b>"open contours"</b> and you may also want to increase 
the <i>line width</i> to about <b>3</b> and set <i>points per contour</i> to 
<b>2</b> so that each "MEASURING STICK" appears as a nice thick white line. 
After clicking two points (often spanning several sections) you can then 
measure the (selected) line's length by going: <b>Edit > Contour > Info</b>.
</td></tr>

</td><td>To just show a plain box around your boundary you can do so in the 
ModelView window via: <b>Edit &gt; View &gt; Bounding Box</b>, and you can 
change the color from yellow in the Objects dialog. However when I have 
multiple sections joined together in Z I sometime like to delimit/model the 
boundaries by creating a blue "TOMOGRAM BOUNDARIES" object.

</td><td>0 </td><td>255 </td><td>0 </td><td style="background: #00FF00"> green
</td><td>Not often, but in some situations you may want to segment the gold 
fiducial particles which typically occur at the very top and bottom of your 
tomogram. To segment these you should use <b>scattered points</b> with a small 
<i>sphere size</i> for the object. These gold particles are typically 10, 15 
or 20 nm in diameter and appear as dark dots. They are NOT part of the cell, 
but are often added to both sides of a section to aid in aligning tilt series, 
and if done well their distribution should be quite uniform with no clumping. 
<br /><i>NOTE: If you are doing fiducial tracking on a tilt series it's not 
really necessary to label your objects, because it's pretty obvious that all 
your objects/contours are  gold particles.</i>

</td><td>255 </td><td>200 </td><td>0 </td><td style="background: #FFC800"> gold
</td><td>Immunogold labelling or Immunogold staining (IGS) is a staining 
technique used in electron microscopy. Colloidal gold particles are most 
often attached to secondary antibodies which are in turn attached to primary 
antibodies designed to bind a specific protein or other cell component. It 
can also be attached to protein A or protein G instead of a secondary 
antibody, as these proteins bind mammalian IgG Fc regions in a non-specic way. 
Gold is used for its high electron density which increases electron scatter 
to give high contrast "dark spots". To segment these, use a 
<b>scattered point</b> object, with a <i>small sphere size</i> of about 1-5 
(whatever fits best). <br /><i>NOTE: Although they appear the same, these 
gold particles are different from "gold fiducials" (which are used purely for 
alignment).</i>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In this article I've explained the importance of naming conventions, and 
suggested a set of standards you should follow. To revise:
</p>
<blockquote style="background: white; border: 1px solid rgb(153, 153, 153); 
padding: 1em;">
Each group should create a <b>table of standard object names and colors</b> 
for all the common compartments which students will need to name and segment.
<ul><li> <u>Standard object names</u> should be:
<ul><li> Spelt in full
</li><li> Title case
</li><li> Singular
</li><li> Tied to a shared vocabulary such as the 
<a href="http://www.neuinfo.org/nif/" title="http://www.neuinfo.org/nif/">
NIF ontology</a>.
</li><li> <i>some examples: <b>"Free Ribosome", "Mitochondria Membrane Outer", 
"Peroxisome", "Autolysosome", "Nuclear Pore"</b> ... and so on</i>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> The <b>Name Wizard</b> IMOD plugin provides a nice interface to help 
you implement this table as a CSV file and use this to verify all your objects 
have correct names and colors.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> In cases where it make sense to use <u>multiple objects per 
compartment type</u> (such as one object per surface), use the same color 
and name, and use a period to separate the number. 
<ul><li> <i>some examples: <b>"Multivesicular Body.001", 
"Multivesicular Body.002", "Multivesicular Body.003", ... </b> ... and so on</i>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> For <u>non-standard object</u> (objects which don't represent 
cellular compartments), you can enforce your own standards, but I recommend 
using capitals to make them stick out. 
<ul><li> <i>some examples: <b>"POINTS OF INTEREST", "UNKNOWN", 
"MINDIST Golgi Apparatus AND Transport Vesicle WITHIN 50nm", ... 
</b> ... and so on</i>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</blockquote><br>
I hope this has convinced you to develop your own table of standard object 
names and colors to enforce within your group. If this article has convinced 
you (even a little bit) to create such a table I encourage you to forward 
this article to other people!<br><br>
