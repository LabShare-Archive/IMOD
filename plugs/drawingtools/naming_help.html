<h3>Object Names</h3><br>
--------------------------<br>
<br>
<h3>Why is it Important to Name Objects Consistently?</h3><br>
<br>
A common problem in segmentation programs, such as IMOD/3dmod, is that 
<b>users often don't know how or forget to provide adequate labeling for 
the structures they segment</b>. All over the world, science/electron 
tomography labs tell the same story of having tens to hundreds of IMOD models 
with object names such as "<i>blue object</i>", "<i>round things</i>" or 
(more commonly) no label at all. Segmentation is usually carried out by 
students who are never taught the importance of labeling objects, who are 
allowed to chose their own colors and who only stay in the lab for a 
short-to-medium time period. Anyone else in the group who opens these 
model files thus has no idea what they're looking at.<br>
<br>
Without a <b>consistent naming system</b> it become very difficult for 
scientists for analyze single models - let alone analyze differences between 
several models by several different people. As a result, such models often 
get disregarded: wether it's poor segmentation or poor labeling no-body wants 
to go back and fix someone else's model, thus if a model is to have a chance 
of being analyzed and reused for publication, it's important the lab trains 
new users to identify, segment and label all objects correctly!<br>

<br>
<h3>How to Name Objects in IMOD</h3>
<br>
To name an object in 3dmod you can simply go: <b>Edit > Object > Type</b> 
then enter a "name", and to change it's color go <b>Edit > Object > Color</b>. 
Making people name objects is only half the battle: the other half is doing 
it right! Even if students have been sufficiently trained to correctly 
identify an organelle, if left to their own devices, multiple students will 
give the same object type different labels and different colors. For example, 
what one student may (accurately) name <i>"Mitochondrial Outer Membrane"</i>, 
others may name "<i>Mitochondria", "mitochondrion", "Mito memb", "MITO23"</i> 
and so on. To reduce these differences, every group should try and build and 
then enforce a set of standard names and colors which can be expressed as a 
simple table. As an example of this, below is an excerpt from a table used to 
segment pancreatic beta cells:<br>

<p>Notice here that:
</p>
<ol><li> all names are in <b>Title Case</b> <i>(i.e. first letter capitalized, the rest in lowercase)</i>
</li><li> all names are <b>Singular</b> <i>(eg: "Microtubule" instead of "Microtubules", even thought the object is likely to contain many microtubules)</i>
</li><li> all these names were taken from the <b><a href="http://www.neurolex.org/wiki/Subcellular_Parts_Table" class="external text" title="http://www.neurolex.org/wiki/Subcellular_Parts_Table" rel="nofollow">NeuroLex "Subcellular Parts Table"</a></b>. <i>(to ensure consistency with other cell biology groups)</i>
</li></ol>
<p>Your own group can and should build a similar table using standard names from your field. Although difficult, it's also a good idea to try and use the same ordering of object types across similar models, since most IMOD analysis tools (such as mtk) require you to list the object's number. You can renumber objects using: <b>Edit &gt; Object &gt; Renumber...</b>.<br>

<br>
<h3>Using the "Name Wizard" Plugin</h3><br>
<br>
To help encourage consistent naming and coloring of objects I created a IMOD plugin called "<b>Name Wizard</b>". This plugin works by loading a <b>table of standard names and colors</b>, plus optional hyperlinks and unique IDs from a CSV (comma separated value) file in the "IMOD_CALIB_DIR" at: "<b>/usr/local/standard_names_persistent.csv</b>" or (if this does not exist) at in the "IMOD_PLUGIN_DIR" under "<b>$IMOD_DIR/lib/imodplug/standard_names.csv</b>" <i>(NOTE: The former file location is preferred because it will not get overwritten when IMOD is reinstalled)</i>. By default there are just over 200 entries which were taken from the <a href="http://www.neurolex.org/wiki/Subcellular_Parts_Table" class="external text" title="http://www.neurolex.org/wiki/Subcellular_Parts_Table" rel="nofollow">NeuroLex "Subcellular Parts Table"</a>, and you can open these cvs files to modify them or create your own entries. In addition to auto-complete, this plugin helps rapidly enter and verify that all names match the entries in the csv file. There are also options here to manage objects by reordering, deleting, merging or splitting. Thus, if you are serious about making your group use consistent labels, I recommending installing the same "standard_names_persistent.csv" and installing Name Wizard on all computers in your group.
<ul><li><b>Installation Instructions</b>
<ul><li>Name Wizard was created Jan 2010, so it may take while before it's part of the standard IMOD release... in the meantime you can install Name Wizard manually by downloading the latest version (which matches your platform) from: <a href="ftp://bio3d.colorado.edu/latestIMOD/alpha/plugins/" class="external free" title="ftp://bio3d.colorado.edu/latestIMOD/alpha/plugins/" rel="nofollow">ftp://bio3d.colorado.edu/latestIMOD/alpha/plugins/</a>. Copy this file + "standard_names.csv" + "namewizard.html" to your <b>$IMOD_DIR/lib/imodplug/</b> directory, and the next time you start 3dmod you should be able the see and start the plugin under <b>"Special > Name Wizard"</b>.

<h3>Shared Vocabularies and Ontologies</h3><br>
<br>
To ensure proper names are used between groups, cellular biology organizations/initiatives such as the "<a href="http://neuinfo.org/" class="external text" title="http://neuinfo.org/" rel="nofollow">Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF)</a>" have built large <b>ontologies</b> containing <b>shared vocabularies</b>. An ontology is much more than just using standardized names: and ontology is "a formal representation of knowledge as a set of concepts with a domain and the relationship between those concepts". Effectively it's like a set of rules... for example:<br>
<ul><li> <b>Mitochondrial Outer Membrane</b> <i>"is part of"</i> <b>Mitochondrion</b>
</li><li> <b>Mitochondrion</b> <i>"is an"</i> <b>Organelle</b>
</li><li> <b>Organelle</b> <i>"is part of"</i> <b>Cell</b>
</li></ul><br>
This tells us where-ever there is an organelle, it must be contained within a cell. This information can be very useful for analysis and even in segmentation algorithms. Since IMOD can be used over a broad number of domains (including material science), it does not contain or enforce any ontology rules/logic, however it's still a good idea to be aware of such ontologies, and adhere to the most relevant naming conventions.<br>

<br>
<h3>Finding Correct Names for Cellular and Sub-cellular Compartments using the NIF Website</h3>
<br>
<p>Although there are (unfortunately) no enforced standards, a good standard to use in the field of cellular biology are the "<b><a href="http://neuinfo.org/#vocab/" class="external text" title="http://neuinfo.org/#vocab/" rel="nofollow">NIF Vocabularies</a></b>". NIF, an initiative at the University of San Diego California, provides the following website interface where you can being typing the name of an organelle and an auto-complete feature will suggest the appropriate name:
</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.neuinfo.org/nif/" class="external text" title="http://www.neuinfo.org/nif/" rel="nofollow">NIF's Search Interface</a>
</li></ul>
<p>NIF ontology, they also provide a list of common subcellular compartments here:
</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.neurolex.org/wiki/Subcellular_Parts_Table" class="external text" title="http://www.neurolex.org/wiki/Subcellular_Parts_Table" rel="nofollow">NeuroLex "Subcellular Parts Table"</a>.
</li></ul>
<p>Clicking on any of these organelles will link to information and often pictures of that organelle. Note that each "object" in NeuroLex contains a unique identifier. For example "<a href="http://www.neurolex.org/wiki/Category:Microtubule_(sao1846835077)" class="external text" title="http://www.neurolex.org/wiki/Category:Microtubule_(sao1846835077)" rel="nofollow">Microtubule</a>" has the unique identifier "sao1846835077".
<br>

<br>
<h3>Single Object Per Compartment Type vs. Multiple Objects</h3><br>
<br>
<p>Within IMOD each "Object" contains: <b>many contours</b> and these contours are meshed together across the volume to form <b>multiple surfaces</b>. Although many groups create a SINGLE object for each type of organelle..... other groups prefer to segment each individual organelle (each surface) in a new object. When you do this it's still important to name objects consistently, and you may also want to add a number to the end, for example:<br>
<br>
<table border="2" bgcolor="#FBFBFF" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" rules="all" style="width: 450px">

<tr bgcolor="#F3F3FF">

Notice that an accurate label ("Axon") has been used, and a number suffixed to each object, separated by a period. The big drawback of this method is that you'll probably end up with a LOT of objects in your model file, and each will have to be individually renamed and colored, however there are also some advantages to such a method. The pros and cons of having multiple objects versus one object per "object type", are summarized in this table:<br>

<th>Pros:

<ul>
<li>Few objects per model (usually &lt; 10) means it's much easier to mange (i.e. to setup/recolor and rename objects).</li>
