GOLD FIDUCIAL,0,255,0,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloidal_gold,,Not often; but in some situations you may want to segment the gold fiducial particles which typically occur at the very top and bottom of your tomogram.

They are NOT part of the cell; but are often added to both sides of a section to aid in aligning tilt series; and if done well their distribution should be quite uniform with no clumping. <br><i>NOTE: If you are doing fiducial tracking on a tilt series it's not really necessary to label your objects; because it's pretty obvious that all your objects/contours are  gold particles.</i>,,

It can also be attached to protein A or protein G instead of a secondary antibody; as these proteins bind mammalian IgG Fc regions in a non-specic way. Gold is used for its high electron density which increases electron scatter to give high contrast ""dark spots"". To segment these; use a <b>scattered point</b> object; with a <i>small sphere size</i> of about 1-5 (whatever fits best). <br><i>NOTE: Although they appear the same; these gold particles are different from ""gold fiducials"" (which are used purely for alignment).</i>",,
