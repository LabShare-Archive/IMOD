<h3>Interpolator Plugin Help</h3><br>
--------------------------<br><br>
This plugin allows for rapid segmentation of surfaces
by automatically generating <b>"interpolated"</b> contours between
the <b>"key"</b> contours which you have manually drawn. 
Each time you add a new contour, press <i>[Enter]</i> (instead of [n])
and the program will generate interpolated contours between 
any connected key contours either side of the contour you have
just added or modified.<br>
Contours are <b>"connected"</b> if they are within <b>"Z Bridge"</b> slices
of each other and the computer believes they are part of the same surface
as according to the selected <b>"surface method"</b>.
The shape of interpolated contours depends on which
<b>"interpolation type"</b> you have selected.<br>

<b>List of Interpolation Types</b><br>
--------------------------<br><br>
<ol>
<li><b>None</b> - lets you use normal contour drawing behavior.</li>
<li><b>Linear</b> - generates interpolated contours with straight
lines between key contours.</li>
<li><b>Spherical</b> - generates interpolated contours in the profile
of sphere, and does not deal with branching.</li>
<li><b>Smooth</b> - generates interpolated contours such they 
form a smooth, curved surfaces. </li>
<li><b>Smooth Pts</b> - as previous, but more sensitive to changes
on different sides of the contour. </li>
</ol>

  <b>Hot Key Summary</b><br>
  ---------------------<br>
  <b>[Enter]</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Interpolate selected contour and start new contour<br>
  <b>[n]</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Start new contour (without interpolating current contour)<br>
  <b>[u]</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Toggle current contour between key/interpolated<br>
  <br>
  <b>[g]</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Find next gap or isolated contour (NOTE: to enable ghosting, 
  try pressing [ctrl+g])<br>
  <b>[h]</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Find next large hole between key contours (ie. a large region of 
  consecutive interpolated contours)<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Tips</b><br>
  ---------------------<br>
  <br> 
  Get used to pressing [enter] to interpolate each contour you draw or modify. If contours are too far in XY to join, try changing the &quot;surface method&quot; to touching or hold [shift] and [enter] to force the current contour to linearly interpolate with the last contour you interpolated (in the same object).
</p>
<p>If you are not happy with the shape of interpolated contours you can 
  either undo [apple+u], add/modify more contours, or change the 
  interpolation options and type.
  Select <b>'Clear all Interp'</b> to delete all interpolated contours
  and 'Regenerate Interp' to regenerate all key contours.<br>
  <br>
  All of these interpolation types are intended for use with <strong>closed 
    contours</strong> and so may give undesirable results for open or 
  scattered point objects which span multiple slices.<br>
  <br>
  Interpolation can become sluggish for objects with numerous contours. 
  To improve performance you should consider adding an extra object and 
  then use <i>'edit > object > move'</i> to merge the contours into the 
  desired object periodically.<br> 
  <br>
  To segment compartments even faster, try using this "Interpolator" 
  plugin in unison with the "Drawing Tools" plugin.<br>
  <br>
  The best settings to use depend on the size, shape and complexity of the
  surfaces you are segmenting. For relatively round/simple medium-to-large
  surfaces I suggest 'Spherical' interpolation with a Z Bridge of maybe 40.
  If your surfaces are highly branched you may want to change the surface
  method to 'touching', branching to 'merge conts', reduce Z Bridge and
  use either 'Linear' or 'Smooth' interpolation.
  In the end, trial and error is the only way to find the best settings -
  don't forget you can fine-tune some of these settings by clicking
  the 'More Settings' button.<br>
