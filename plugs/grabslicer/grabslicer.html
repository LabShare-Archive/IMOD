<h3>Grab With Note Plugin Help</h3><br>
--------------------------<br><br>
This plugin is designed to grab the display in 3dmod top Slicer or 
Zap window, and save it as an image with text note and Slicer
parameters (if it's a Slicer window) or the center position (if it's a Zap
window).  The top window is the one with the most recent activity.  Select
which kind of window you want to grab with the <B>Slicer</B>
and <B>Zap</B> radio buttons.  The snapshot type is controlled by the
<B>JPEG</B>, <B>PNG</B>, and <B>TIFF</B> buttons.  The notes will include the
image filename; if multiple files are loaded, the name of the current file is
shown.
<br><br><br>
<b>Display Features</b><br>
---------------------<br>
When this plugin is open, scale bars will be displayed in the image windows
even when the Scale Bar dialog is not open, provided that
 <B>Show and record scale bar</B> is checked.  This will be turned on by
 default if the image or model file appears to have a pixel size defined.
<P>
Another special feature when this plugin is open is that snapshots can
be of the full window area, even when a rubber band is drawn in the window.
This happens whenever <B>Always snapshot whole window</B> is checked.
Thus, you can use a rubber band to outline an area of interest in either type
of window.  The lasso in the Zap toolbar can also be used
for outlining a feature.
<P>
This plugin lets you draw multiple arrows in either type of window.  The first
time you press <B>Add Arrow</B>, it acts just the same as using the arrow
button in the window's toolbar.  However, you can press it again and draw
another arrow, without losing the previously drawn arrows.  Press <B>Clear
Arrows</B> to remove all arrows from the top window of the selected type.  The
arrows will also go away when this dialog is closed.
<br><br><br>
<B>Text Box for Notes</B>
Text that you type in the box will appear below the filename and other
standard information that is added to the snapshot. 
The text that you enter will be line-wrapped, but you can use "Enter" to break
lines.  Adding a note is optional.  
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Save Image</b><br>
---------------------<br>

This button saves the grabbed image with note in the standard 3dmod snapshot directory
with default snapshot naming.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Save to Database</b><br>
---------------------<br>

If you are using Caltech Tomography Database, this button is present and you may use it
to add the grabbed image with note to the database and attach it with a given 
tilt series ID. A database configuration file must be present.

<ul>
<li><b>image type</b> - To save space in the database, only JPEG or PNG can be saved 
to the database.</li>
<li><b>tilt series id</b> - You may manually input a "Tilt Series Database ID". If
  the 3D image opened by 3dmod is under a standard path in the database (has
  a format of &lt;Database path&gt;/&lt; tilt series id&gt;/... ), or it is downloaded
  from the database with "Download Files with Database Structure", the
  tilt series id will be automatically detected.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<b>Setup of Database Image Path on Server </b><br>
---------------------<br>
  The directory &lt;Database path&gt;/Caps/ should be
  created by the database administrator and it should be writable. All images are saved
  under &lt;Database path&gt;/Caps/ with file name formats 
  &lt;tilt series id&gt;_&lt;zap or slicer&gt;&lt;file id&gt;.jpg

<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Setup of Configuration File on User Computer</b><br>
---------------------<br>
A configuration file should be located at $IMOD_CALIB_DIR/grabDatabase.ini. 
By default $IMOD_CALIB_DIR is /usr/local/ImodCalib/ .  The configuration file
  should have 5 lines:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dbpath '/path/to/database/'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dbhost 'ip_address_of_host'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dbname 'database_name'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dbuser 'username'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dbpass 'password'
<br>
where in each case the text should be contained in single quotes as shown.
