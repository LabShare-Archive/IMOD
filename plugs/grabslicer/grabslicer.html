<h3>Grab With Note Plugin Help</h3><br>
--------------------------<br><br>
This plugin is designed to grab the display in 3dmod top Slicer or 
Zap window, and save it as an image with text note and Slicer
parameters (if it's Slicer window) or the center position (if it's a Zap window).
<P>
When this plugin is open, scale bars will be displayed in the image windows
even when the Scale Bar dialog is not open, provided that
 <B>Show and record scale bar</B> is checked.  This will be turned on by
 default if the image or model file appears to have a pixel size defined.
<P>
Another special feature when this plugin is open is that snapshots will always
be of the full window area, even when a rubber band is drawn in the window.
Thus, you can use a rubber band to outline an area of interest in either type
of window.  The toolbar in either window also provides an arrow for pointing
to a feature of interest, and the lasso in the Zap toolbar can also be used
for outlining a feature.

<b>Save Image</b><br>
---------------------<br>

This function saves the grabbed image with note in standard 3dmod snapshot directory
with default snapshot naming.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Save to Database</b><br>
---------------------<br>

If you are using Caltech Tomography Database, you may use this function 
to add grabbed image with note to the database and attached with a given 
tilt series id. A database configuration file must be present.

<ul>
<li><b>image type</b> - For display purpose, only JPG or PNG are allowed to be saved 
to database.</li>
<li><b>configuration file</b> - should be located at $IMOD_CALIB_DIR/grabDatabase.ini. 
By default $IMOD_CALIB_DIR is /usr/local/ImodCalib/ .</li>
<li><b>tilt series id</b> - you may manually input "Tilt Series Database ID", or,
if the 3D image opened by 3dmod is under standard path in the database (has a format
of &lt;Database path&gt;/&lt; tilt series id&gt;/... ), the tilt series id will be automatically
detected.</li>
<li><b>database image path</b> - all images are saved under  &lt;Database path&gt;/Caps/ .
File name formats: &lt;tilt series id&gt;_&lt;zap or slicer&gt;&lt;file id&gt;.jpg</li>
</ul>
