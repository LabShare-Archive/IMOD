This script will install or uninstall links in /usr/lib to the IMOD and Qt
libraries in IMOD so that you can run 3dmod by clicking on it.
You must run it as root with sudo.  Enter
    linklibs-mac -i [PATH_TO_IMOD]   to make the links, or
    linklibs-mac -u [PATH_TO_IMOD]   to remove the links
The PATH_TO_IMOD (e.g., /Applications/IMOD) must be entered on OS X 10.5 or
higher.
It is optional for older OS X but is needed if the environment variable
IMOD_DIR is not yet defined.
