Programs were written by David Mastronarde, James Kremer, Rick
Gaudette, Sue Held, and Quanren Xiong from the BL3DEMC, some based on
work and libraries from the MRC.  We thank David Agard and Hans Chen for
the original MRC source code, Wah Chiu for a Unix version of low-level
MRC file routines used in the FORTRAN parts, and Chuck Robertson for
much work on the port to Linux.

The program nad_eed_3d by Achilleas Frangakis and Reiner Hegerl is
copyright Max-Planck-Institut for Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany.

The LSQR routine by Michael Saunders is used in some programs.  It is
covered by the Common Public License.  IMOD now uses a C version of LSQR
and some BLAS routines from the BCLS package of Michael Friedlander,
which are covered by the Lesser GPL.  The source code used here and the
licenses can be found at  http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/openSource

IMOD uses a subset of the LAPACK routines developed at Univ. of
Tennessee, Univ. of California Berkeley, NAG Ltd., Courant Institute,
Argonne National Lab, and Rice University.  They is copyrighted by the
University of Tennessee and covered by a BSD-style license that can be
found at http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/openSource.  IMOD also uses a subset
of the BLAS routines, developed by: Jack Dongarra, Argonne National Lab;
Jeremy Du Croz, NAG Ltd.; Iain Duff, AERE Harwell; Richard Hanson, Sandia
National Labs; and Sven Hammarling, NAG Ltd. 

The program imodwincpu was adapted from code obtained from
www.codeproject.com and written by Dudi Abramov.  It is covered by the

Routines for computing some statistical functions were adapted from

Wiley & Sons, 1996 and are copyrighted by the authors and publisher.

Andrew Noske at the University of Queensland, Australia contributed the
beadhelper, drawingtools, and interpolator plugins.

The isosurface display in 3dmod uses contouring and surface smoothing
modules from Chimera, developed at the Resource for Biocomputing,
Visualization, and Informatics at the University of California, San
Francisco, supported by NIH/NCRR grant P41-RR01081.
