Programs were written by David Mastronarde, James Kremer, Rick
Gaudette, Sue Held, and Quanren Xiong from the BL3DEMC, some based on
work and libraries from the MRC.  We thank David Agard and Hans Chen for
the original MRC source code, Wah Chiu for a Unix version of low-level
MRC file routines used in the FORTRAN parts, and Chuck Robertson for
much work on the port to Linux.

The program nad_eed_3d by Achilleas Frangakis and Reiner Hegerl is
copyright Max-Planck-Institut for Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany.

The LSQR routine by Michael Saunders is used in some programs.  IMOD uses a
C version of LSQR and some BLAS routines from the BCLS package of Michael
Friedlander, which are covered by the Lesser GPL (see LGPL.txt).

IMOD uses a subset of the LAPACK routines developed at Univ. of Tennessee,
Univ. of California Berkeley, NAG Ltd., Courant Institute, Argonne National
Lab, and Rice University.  They are copyrighted by the University of
Tennessee and covered by a BSD-style license (see LAPACK.txt).  IMOD also
uses a subset of the BLAS routines, developed by: Jack Dongarra, Argonne
National Lab; Jeremy Du Croz, NAG Ltd.; Iain Duff, AERE Harwell; Richard
Hanson, Sandia National Labs; and Sven Hammarling, NAG Ltd.

The program imodwincpu was adapted from code obtained from
www.codeproject.com and written by Dudi Abramov.  It is excluded from the
GPL license and is covered exclusively by the Code Project Open License (see
CPOL.html). 

Routines for computing some statistical functions were adapted from
S. J. Zhang and J. M. Jin, Computation of Special Functions. New York: John
Wiley & Sons, 1996 and are copyrighted by the authors and publisher.

Andrew Noske (originally at the University of Queensland, Australia, then at
the University of California, San Diego) contributed the beadhelper,
drawingtools, interpolator, namewizard, and stereology plugins.  See the help
displayed by those plugins for acknowledgements of funding for his work.

The isosurface display in 3dmod uses contouring and surface smoothing
modules from Chimera, developed at the Resource for Biocomputing,
Visualization, and Informatics at the University of California, San
Francisco, supported by NIH/NCRR grant P41-RR01081.

RAPTOR was developed by Fernando Amat Farshid Moussavi, and Mark Horowitz
at Stanford University and is copyrighted by them.  It is covered by the
license in RAPTORlicense.txt.  It uses three libraries, parts of which are
included in the IMOD source code distribution:
OpenCV (http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/), 
covered by the license in OpenCV.txt, 
SuiteSparse (http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/SuiteSparse/), 
covered by the licenses in CSparse.txt and LGPL.txt, and 
Stair Vision Library (http://sourceforge.net/projects/stairvision/), 
covered by the license in StairVision.txt.

The warping library uses modules from Pavel Sakov's 'nn' package, which are
copyrighted by Sakov and CSIRO, and covered by the license in nn.txt.  The
library also uses code from Ken Clarkson's 'hull' program, which is
copyrighted by AT&T and covered by the license in hull.txt.

Routines for solving 3x3 eigenvectors are copyrighted by Joachim Kopp and
covered by the LGPL license.

Mauro Maiorca, at the University of Melbourne, Australia, contributed the
preNAD program.  It uses recursive line filter routines from Gregoire
Malandain, covered by version 3 of the GPL (see GPL-3.0.txt).

IMOD uses TIFF libraries which are Copyright (c) 1988-1997 Sam Leffler
and Copyright (c) 1991-1997 Silicon Graphics, Inc. (see TIFF.txt).
