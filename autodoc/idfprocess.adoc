[Field = InputFile1]
short = in1
long = InputFile1
type = FN
usage = First input file with distortion fields
tooltip = 
manpage = First input file with distortion fields.  If this option is not
entered, the first non-option argument will be used for this input file.

[Field = InputFile2]
short = in2
type = FN
usage = Second input file with distortion fields
tooltip = 
manpage = Second input file with distortion fields.  If this option is not
entered and a second input file is expected, the second non-option argument
will be used for this input file.

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output file for processed distortion fields (optional)
tooltip = 
manpage = Output file for processed distortion fields.  If this option is not
entered, the second or third non-option argument will be used for the output
file, depending on whether one or two input files are required.  If no output
file is specified at all, then statistics will be computed.

[Field = Product]
short = product
type = B
usage = Compute product of two distortion fields 
tooltip =

[Field = Difference]
short = difference
type = B
usage = Compute difference between two distortion fields
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = Inverse]
short = inverse
type = B
usage = Compute the inverse of the distortion field
tooltip =

[Field = Statistics]
short = stats
type = B
usage = Report mean, SD, and max of distortion vectors
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = SecondGrid]
short = second
type = B
usage = Use second input file's grid characteristics for output
tooltip = 
manpage = If the grid characteristics (spacing and number of grid points)
differ between the two files, convert to the second file's characteristics
rather than the first.
