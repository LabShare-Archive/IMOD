[Field = InputFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input model file to be clipped
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output file, either clipped model or list of points
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of output file, which can be either an IMOD model file or text file
with a list of point coordinates.

[Field = PointOutput]
short = point
type = I
usage = 1 to make a point instead of a model output file (-1 for corner points)
tooltip = 
manpage = Enter 1 to make a point output file instead of a model output file.
Nearest integer coordinates will be output; use Model2point(1) to get more
flexible point list output.  Enter -1 to get a point list with corner points
added each time a new Z value is encountered; in this case -xminmax and
-yminmax must be entered.

[Field = XMinAndMax]
short = xminmax
type = FPM
usage = Starting and ending X coordinates to include or exclude, numbered from 0
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending X index coordinates to include or exclude,
numbered from 0.  Enter a / to take the default, which is to have no selection
based on X coordinate.

[Field = YMinAndMax]
short = yminmax
type = FPM
usage = Starting and ending Y coordinates to include or exclude, numbered from 0
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending Y index coordinates to include or exclude,
numbered from 0.  Enter a / to take the default, which is to have no selection
based on Y coordinate.

[Field = ZMinAndMax]
short = zminmax
type = FPM
usage = Starting and ending Z coordinates to include or exclude, numbered from 0
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending Z coordinates to include or exclude,
numbered from 0.  Enter a / to take the default, which is to have no selection
based on Z coordinate.  Starting and ending will be adjusted down and
up by 0.005, respectively, so whole numbers can be entered; e.g., 16,18 will clip out
sections 16 through 18.

[Field = ExcludeOrInclude]
short = exclude
type = IA
usage = 1 to exclude or 0 to include points within coordinate block
tooltip = 
manpage = 1 to exclude or 0 to include points within specified coordinate
block.  Multiple values can be entered for a sequence of operations.  The
number of -xminmax, -yminmax, and -zminmax entries must each be equal to the
number of values entered here, unless an option is not entered at all for that
dimension.  If any coordinate limits are entered, the default for this entry
is a single 0; in other words, you can omit this entry if you are just
clipping out coordinates inside one coordinate block.

[Field = LongestContourSegment]
short = longest
type = B
usage = Retain just longest segment instead of all contour segments inside volume
tooltip = 
manpage = Retain only the longest segment of a contour that is within the
volume being included, instead of all segments.

[Field = ObjectList]
short = objects
type = LI
usage = List of model objects to remove or clip endpoints from
tooltip = 
manpage = List of model objects to remove or clip endpoints from.  This option
cannot be entered together with any of the options for clipping by
coordinates.  If -ends is entered, points will be removed from endpoints of
contours; otherwise whole objects will be removed.

[Field = ClipFromStartAndEnd]
short = ends
type = IP
usage = Number of points to clip from start and end of contours
tooltip = 
manpage = Number of points to clip from start and end of contours for the
objects specified by -objects; the latter must be entered.

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
long = ParameterFile
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.

[Field = usage]
short = help
long = usage
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage =
