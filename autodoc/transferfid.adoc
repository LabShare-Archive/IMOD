[Field = Setname]
short = s
type = CH
usage = Root name of dataset
tooltip =
manpage = Root name of dataset (omit the a or b)

[Field = TransferBtoA]
short = b
type = B
usage = Transfer fiducials in backwards direction, from B to A
tooltip =
manpage = Transfer backwards, from the "b" axis to the "a" axis.  You will generally
not need to specify any filenames with this option.

[Field = AImageFile]
short = ia
type = FN
usage = Name of axis A image file (default taken from tracka.com)
tooltip =
manpage = Set the name of the image file upon which the fiducial model for the "a" axis
tilt series was built; the default is to take the name from the tracka.com
command file.

[Field = BImageFile]
short = ib
type = FN
usage = Name of axis B image file (default taken from trackb.com)
tooltip =
manpage = Set the name of the image file for tracking beads in the "b" axis tilt series;
the default is to take the name from the trackb.com command file.

[Field = FiducialModel]
short = f
type = FN
usage = Name of source axis fiducial model (default setnamea.fid, or
setnameb.fid with -b option)
tooltip =
manpage = Set the name of the fiducial model file for the first, already tracked tilt 
series; the default is setnamea.fid (or setnameb.fid with the "-b" option.)

[Field = SeedModel]
short = o
type = FN
usage = Name of output file (default setnameb.seed, or 
setnamea.seed with -b option)
tooltip =
manpage = Set the name of the output file for the seed model; the default is
setnameb.seed (or setnamea.fid with the "-b" option.)

[Field = ViewsToSearch]
short = n
type = I
usage = Number of views to search to find best pair (default $nviews)
tooltip =
manpage = Set the number of views from each data set to include in the search for the
best matching pair of views; the default is 5.

[Field = ACenterView]
short = za
type = I
usage = Number of view in A to center search around (default is 
view closest to zero tilt in setnamea.rawtlt)
tooltip =
manpage = Set the number of the view from the "a" axis tilt series around which to search
for the best match; the default is the view nearest to zero tilt, using
tilt angles in the file setnamea.rawtlt or tilt angles implied by
FirstTiltAngle and TiltIncrement entries in tracka.com.

[Field = BCenterView]
short = zb
type = I
usage = Number of view in B to center search around (default is 
view closest to zero tilt in setnameb.rawtlt)
tooltip =
manpage = Set the number of the view from the "b" axis tilt series around which to search
for the best match; the default is the view nearest to zero tilt, using
tilt angles in the file setnameb.rawtlt or tilt angles implied by
FirstTiltAngle and TiltIncrement entries in trackb.com.


[Field = AngleOfRotation]
short = a
type = I
usage = Rotation direction or angle to search (+1, -1, +90, -90
all work, default is to search both directions)
tooltip =
manpage = Use this option to specify the direction of rotation from the first to the
second axis.  Only the sign of this number matters, so you can enter -1 or -90
for clockwise rotations, or 1 or 90 for counterclockwise rotations.  In the
absence of this option, the program will consider both directions of rotation.

[Field = MirrorXaxis]
short = x
type = B
usage = Mirror one image around X axis
tooltip =
manpage = Mirror one image around the X axis before rotating by 90 degrees.

[Field = RunMidas]
short = m
type = B
usage = Run Midas to set initial translational/rotational alignment
tooltip =
manpage = Run Midas on the first pair of views, and use the alignment that you set in
Midas as the initial alignment for all pairs of views that are considered.

[Field = CorrespondingCoordFile]
short = c
type = FN
usage = File to place corresponding coordinates in
tooltip =
manpage = Use this option to have corresponding fiducial coordinates on the best matching
views placed into an output file.  This file will also record the section
numbers in the two sets and whether the transfer was from "b" to "a".

[Field = LowestTiltTransformFile]
short = lowest
type = FN
usage = File in which to save transform for lowest tilt pair of views
tooltip =
manpage = 

[Field = LeaveTempFiles]
short = t
type = B
usage = Leave temporary files in temporary directory
tooltip =
manpage = For diagnosing problems, leave temporary files in the standard
temporary directory (/usr/tmp, /tmp, or defined by IMOD_TMPDIR) or in the
current directory if there is no temporary directory.
