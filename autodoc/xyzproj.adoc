[Field = InputFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input image file
tooltip = 
manpage = Input image file to project.  If this option
is not entered, the first non-option argument will be used for the input
file.

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output image file
tooltip = 
manpage = Output file for projection.  If this option
is not entered, the second non-option argument will be used for the output
file.

[Field = AxisToTiltAround]
short = axis
type = CH
usage = Axis to tilt around (X, Y, or Z)
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = XMinAndMax]
short = xminmax
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending X index coordinates of block to project
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending X index coordinates of block to project
(numbered from 0).  The default is the whole extent in X.

[Field = YMinAndMax]
short = yminmax
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending Y index coordinates of block to project
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending Y index coordinates of block to project
(numbered from 0).  The default is the whole extent in Y.

[Field = ZMinAndMax]
short = zminmax
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending Z index coordinates of block to project
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending Z index coordinates of block to project
(numbered from 0).  The default is the whole extent in Z.

[Field = StartEndIncAngle]
short = angles
type = FT
usage = Starting, ending, and increment tilt angle
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting, ending, and increment tilt angle.  Enter the same value
for starting and ending angle to get only one image.

[Field = ModeToOutput]
short = mode
type = I
usage = Mode of output file (0 for byte, 1 for integer, 2 for real)
tooltip = 
manpage = Mode of output file (0 for byte, 1 for integer, 2 for real).  The
default is mode 1 for input mode 0 or 1, mode 2 for input mode 2.

[Field = WidthToOutput]
short = width
type = I
usage = Width of output file (default is same as width of input coordinates)
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = AddThenMultiply]
short = addmult
type = FP
usage = Factors to add then multiply by (default 0,1)
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = FillValue]
short = fill 
type = F
usage = Value to fill empty areas with (default is mean)
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = ConstantScaling]
short = constant 
type = B
usage = Scale all projection sums by the same amount
tooltip = 
manpage = Scale all projection sums by the same amount, by dividing by the 
thickness of the slab being projected.  The default is to
divide each projection sum by the number of pixels along the projection ray.
Constant scaling is more appropriate when projecting a largely empty volume.

[Field = TiltFile]
short = tiltfile
type = FN
usage = File with tilt angles for input images from a tilt series
tooltip = 
manpage = File with tilt angles for input images from a tilt series.  Use this
option if tilt angles are in a file, one per line.

[Field = FirstTiltAngle]
short = first
type = F
usage = Tilt angle of first view in degrees for tilt series images
tooltip = 
manpage = Tilt angle of first view, in degrees, for images from a tilt series.
Use this option together with TiltIncrement.

[Field = TiltIncrement]
short = increment
type = F
usage = Increment between tilt angles of input images
tooltip = 
manpage = Increment between tilt angles, in degrees, for input images from a
tilt series.  Use this option together with FirstTiltAngle.

[Field = TiltAngles]
short = tangles
type = FAM
usage = Individual tilt angles for each view for tilt series images
tooltip = 
manpage = Use this option to enter the tilt angles for each view individually,
in degrees, for input images from a tilt series.

[Field = FullAreaAtTilt]
short = full
type = B
usage = Do not tilt-foreshorten when projecting a tilt series
tooltip =
manpage = Use this option to keep the projection box the same size on all
images of a tilt series, rather than making it smaller at higher tilt.  The
box will thus include new material at each higher tilt.


[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.

[Field = usage]
short = help
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage =
