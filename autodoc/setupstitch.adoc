[Field = InfoFile]
short = info
type = FN
usage = Name of supermontage info file to be created or edited
tooltip =
manpage = Name of a supermontage info file in which all data about the files
will be stored.  If the file exists, it will be read in when the program
starts, and renamed to filename~ before writing a new version when the program
exits.  If this option is not entered, the first non-option argument will be
taken as the name of the info file.

[Field = NoZValues]
short = noz
type = B
usage = Search for and create names without Z values
tooltip =
manpage = Search for and create names without Z values and assume the Z value
is zero.  This option cannot be used when adding a supermontage to an existing
one, or when specifying a z range with -zadd.

[Field = RootName]
short = root
type = CH
usage = Rootname for existing files and ones to be created
tooltip =
manpage = Rootname for existing files and ones to be created.  
Existing files need not be named according to the conventions if they are
already listed in the info file.

[Field = OverlapInXandY]
short = overlap
type = IP
usage = Nominal overlap between adjacent volumes in X and Y
tooltip =
manpage = Nominal overlap between adjacent volumes in X and Y.  This only
needs to be a rough approximation.  This entry is required when adding a
supermontage or the first time a manually prepared info file is read.

[Field = UnderscoreXYZ]
short = underscore
type = B
usage = Use underscores between x, y, and z in composing names
tooltip =
manpage = Use underscores between x, y, and z in composing names for files
being searched for and created.

[Field = ExtensionOnVolumes]
short = ext
type = CH
usage = Extension on filenames when searching for volumes (default .rec)
tooltip =
manpage = Extension on filenames when searching for volumes, including the
period.  There may be characters before the true extension, such as if all
files are named "binned.rec".  The default is .rec.

[Field = AddMontageXandY]
short = xyadd
type = IP
usage = Add a supermontage with the given number of frames in X and Y
tooltip =
manpage = Add a supermontage with the given number of frames in X and Y.  The
program will search for pieces by rootname and frame number in X and Y, with 
numbers starting from 1.

[Field = AddMontageXRange]
short = xadd
type = IP
usage = Add a supermontage with given starting and ending frame numbers in X 
tooltip =
manpage = Starting and ending X values to search for when adding a
supermontage.  Use this option and -yadd if the starting frame number is not 1
in X or in Y.  If one of the two options -xadd and -yadd is entered, then the
other must be entered as well, and -xyadd must not be entered.

[Field = AddMontageYRange]
short = yadd
type = IP
usage = Add a supermontage with given starting and ending frame numbers in Y 
tooltip =
manpage = Starting and ending Y values to search for when adding a
supermontage.

[Field = AddMontageZRange]
short = zadd
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending Z values to search for when adding a supermontage
tooltip =
manpage = Starting and ending Z values to search for when adding a
supermontage.  If this option is entered, then either -xyadd, or -xadd and
-yadd, must be entered.

[Field = DefaultRegionModel]
short = model
type = FN
usage = Patch region model to use for an overlap zone if one is not found
tooltip =
manpage = Patch region model to use for an overlap zone if one is not found
when initially setting up the Edge entries in the info file.  This option will
have an effect only when adding a supermontage or processing a manually
prepared info file for the first time.
