[Field = InputFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input file with images to be filtered
tooltip =
manpage = 

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output file for filtered images (omit to rewrite input file)
tooltip =
manpage = Output file for filtered images.  If this file is omitted, the
program will write filtered images back to the input file.

[Field = StartingAndEndingZ]
short = zrange
type = IP
usage = First and last Z values to filter, numbered from 1 (default is all)
tooltip =
manpage = First and last Z values in the file to filter.  Values are
numbered from 1 and the default is to do all sections.

[Field = FilterIn3D]
short = 3dfilter
type = B
usage = Filter data in 3D instead of in 2D
tooltip = 
manpage = Filter data in 3D instead of in 2D.  The entire volume will be
filtered, so it must fit into memory and -zrange cannot be entered.  If the
volume will not fit in memory, use "clip fft -3d" to get an FFT, run Mtffilter
on the 3D FFT, then inverse transform with "clip fft -3d -m mode", where
mode is the desired output mode, typically the same as the input.

[Field = LowPassRadiusSigma]
short = lowpass
type = FP
usage = Radius and sigma for high-frequency roll-off to 0.0 (default no filter)
tooltip = Cutoff radius and sigma for low pass filter to provide a
high-frequency Gaussian roll-off to 0.0.  (The default is no filtering)
manpage = Cutoff radius and sigma for a low pass filter that imposes a
high-frequency Gaussian roll-off to 0.0.
The default is no high-frequency filtering.  These entries correspond to the
Radius2 and Sigma2 entries to Enhance(1) and other programs; see the
Enhance(1) or Filterplot(1)
man pages for a full explanation of the effects of changing the sign of 
the Sigma2 or the Sigma1 and Radius1 parameters entered with the next two
options.

[Field = HighPassSigma]
short = highpass
type = F
usage = Sigma for inverted Gaussian low-frequency filter (default no filter)
tooltip = 
manpage = Sigma for a high pass filter based on an inverted Gaussian that
starts at 0.0 at zero frequency and decays up to 1 with the given sigma.
The default is no high-frequency filtering.  This entry corresponds to the 
Sigma1 entry to Enhance(1) and other programs.  A negative Sigma1 can be used
to get a band-pass filter based on the second derivative of a Gaussian.

[Field = FilterRadius1]
short = radius1
type = F
usage = Cutoff radius for a high-pass filter that decays with the -lowpass sigma
tooltip = 
manpage = Cutoff radius for a high-pass filter that is 1.0 at this radius and
falls off as a Gaussian to the left of this point with sigma equal to the
Sigma2 value entered with -lowpass.  This entry corresponds to the
Radius1 entry to Enhance(1) and other programs.  A negative Radius1 will
make the inverted Gaussian invoked by -highpass be zero out to |Radius1|.

[Field = MtfFile]
short = mtf
type = FN
usage = File with MTF curve
tooltip =
manpage = File with MTF curve.  The format of the file is a series of lines,
with a spatial frequency in reciprocal pixels and an MTF value on each line. 

[Field = StockCurve]
short = stock
type = I
usage = 1 to use the stock (built-in) MTF curve
tooltip =
manpage = The number of the stock (built-in) MTF curve to use.  Since there is
only one curve, only an entry of 1 is allowed.

[Field = MaximumInverse]
short = maxinv
type = F
usage = Maximum value for inverse of MTF (default 4.0)
tooltip =
manpage = Maximum value for inverse of MTF.  The inverse should always
be limited to reduce noise.

[Field = InverseRolloffRadiusSigma]
short = invrolloff
type = FP
usage = Radius and sigma for gaussian roll-off of inverse to 1.0 (default 0.12
and 0.05)
tooltip =
manpage = 

[Field = XScaleFactor]
short = xscale
type = F
usage = Scaling factor for X-axis of MTF curve (default 1.0)
tooltip =
manpage = Scaling factor for X-axis of MTF curve.  Scaling the X axis is 
probably an adequate way to adapt a curve from one camera or binning to 
another.

[Field = DensityScaleFactor]
short = denscale
type = F
usage = Density scaling factor (default 1.0)
tooltip =
manpage = Scaling factor for image intensities after filtering.

[Field = AmplifierFactorAndPower]
short = amplifier
type = FP
usage = Amplification factor and exponent for low-frequency amplifier filter
tooltip =
manpage = Amplification factor and exponent for low-frequency amplifier
filter.  Either -cutoff or -phase must also be entered.

[Field = CutoffForAmplifier]
short = cutoff
type = F
usage = Cutoff radius in reciprocal pixels for amplifier filter
tooltip =
manpage = Cutoff radius in reciprocal pixels for amplifier filter.  This
option cannot be entered together with -phase.

[Field = PhasePlateParameters]
short = phase
type = FT
usage = Phase plate diameter, voltage, focal length for amplifier filter
tooltip =
manpage = Parameters of phase plate imaging, used to compute a nominal cutoff
radius for the low-frequency amplifier filter.  Enter the phase plate diameter
in nanometers, the voltage in kilovolts, and the objective lens focal length in
millimeters.

[Field = PixelSize]
short = pixel
type = F
usage = Pixel size in nanometers, overrides the pixel spacing in the file header
tooltip =
manpage = Pixel size in nanometers.  A pixel size is needed to compute the
cutoff radius for the amplifier filter from the phase plate parameters.  This
entry is needed only if the pixel size in the image file header is incorrect.

[Field = ParameterFile]
short=param
type=PF
usage=Read parameter entries from file
tooltip=
