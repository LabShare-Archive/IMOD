[Field = InputFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input file with images to be filtered
tooltip =
manpage = 

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output file for filtered images (omit to rewrite input file)
tooltip =
manpage = Output file for filtered images.  If this file is omitted, the
program will write filtered images back to the input file.

[Field = StartingAndEndingZ]
short = zrange
type = IP
usage = First and last Z values to filter, numbered from 1 (default is all)
tooltip =
manpage = First and last Z values in the file to filter.  Values are
numbered from 1 and the default is to do all sections.

[Field = FilterIn3D]
short = 3dfilter
type = B
usage = Filter data in 3D instead of in 2D
tooltip = 
manpage = Filter data in 3D instead of in 2D.  The entire volume will be
filtered, so it must fit into memory and -zrange cannot be entered.  If the
volume will not fit in memory, use "clip fft -3d" to get an FFT, run Mtffilter
on the 3D FFT, then inverse transform with "clip fft -3d -m mode", where
mode is the desired output mode, typically the same as the input.

[Field = LowPassRadiusSigma]
short = lowpass
type = FP
usage = Radius and sigma for high-frequency roll-off to 0.0 (default no filter)
tooltip = Cutoff radius and sigma for low pass filter to provide a
high-frequency Gaussian roll-off to 0.0.  (The default is no filtering)
manpage = Cutoff radius and sigma for a low pass filter that imposes a
high-frequency Gaussian roll-off to 0.0.
The default is no high-frequency filtering.  These entries correspond to the
Radius2 and Sigma2 entries to Enhance(1) and other programs; see the Enhance(1)
man page for a full explanation of the effects of changing the sign of 
the Sigma2 or the Sigma1 and Radius1 parameters entered with the next two
options.

[Field = HighPassSigma]
short = highpass
type = F
usage = Sigma for inverted Gaussian low-frequency filter (default no filter)
tooltip = 
manpage = Sigma for a high pass filter based on an inverted Gaussian that
starts at 0.0 at zero frequency and decays up to 1 with the given sigma.
The default is no high-frequency filtering.  This entry corresponds to the 
Sigma1 entry to Enhance(1) and other programs.  A negative Sigma1 can be used
to get a band-pass filter based on the second derivative of a Gaussian.

[Field = FilterRadius1]
short = radius1
type = F
usage = Cutoff radius for a high-pass filter that decays with Sigma2
tooltip = 
manpage = Cutoff radius for a high-pass filter that is 1.0 at this radius and
falls off as a Gaussian to the left of this point with sigma equal to the
Sigma2 value entered with -lowpass.  This entry corresponds to the
Radius1 entry to Enhance(1) and other programs.  A negative Radius1 will
make the inverted Gaussian invoked by -highpass be zero out to |Radius1|.

[Field = MtfFile]
short = mtf
type = FN
usage = File with MTF curve
tooltip =
manpage = File with MTF curve.  The format of the file is a series of lines,
with a spatial frequency in reciprocal pixels and an MTF value on each line. 

[Field = StockCurve]
short = stock
type = I
usage = The number of the stock (built-in) curve to use
tooltip =
manpage = 

[Field = MaximumInverse]
short = maxinv
type = F
usage = Maximum value for inverse of MTF (default 4.0)
tooltip =
manpage = Maximum value for inverse of MTF.  The inverse should always
be limited to reduce noise.

[Field = InverseRolloffRadiusSigma]
short = invrolloff
type = FP
usage = Radius and sigma for gaussian roll-off of inverse to 1.0 (default 0.12
and 0.05)
tooltip =
manpage = 

[Field = XScaleFactor]
short = xscale
type = F
usage = Scaling factor for X-axis of MTF curve (default 1.0)
tooltip =
manpage = Scaling factor for X-axis of MTF curve.  Scaling the X axis is 
probably an adequate way to adapt a curve from one camera or binning to 
another.

[Field = DensityScaleFactor]
short = denscale
type = F
usage = Density scaling factor (default 1.0)
tooltip =
manpage = Scaling factor for image intensities after filtering.

type=PF
usage=Read parameter entries from file
tooltip=
