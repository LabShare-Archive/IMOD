[Field = InputFile]
short = input
long = InputFile
type = FN
usage = Input file with images to be filtered
tooltip =
manpage = 

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
long = OutputFile
type = FN
usage = Output file for filtered images (omit to rewrite input file)
tooltip =
manpage = Output file for filtered images.  If this file is omitted, the
program will write filtered images back to the input file.

[Field = StartingAndEndingZ]
short = zrange
long = StartingAndEndingZ
type = IP
usage = First and last Z values to filter, numbered from 1 (default is all)
tooltip =
manpage = First and last Z values in the file to filter.  Values are
numbered from 1 and the default is to do all sections.

[Field = LowPassRadiusSigma]
short = lowpass
long = LowPassRadiusSigma
type = FP
usage = Radius and sigma for high-frequency roll-off to 0.0 (default no filter)
tooltip = Cutoff radius and sigma for low pass filter to provide a
high-frequency Gaussian roll-off to 0.0.  (The default is no filtering)
manpage = Cutoff radius and sigma for a low pass filter that imposes a
high-frequency Gaussian roll-off to 0.0.
The default is no high-frequency filtering.

[Field = MtfFile]
short = mtf
long = MtfFile
type = FN
usage = File with MTF curve
tooltip =
manpage = File with MTF curve.  The format of the file is a series of lines,
with a spatial frequency in reciprocal pixels and an MTF value on each line. 

[Field = StockCurve]
short = stock
long = StockCurve
type = I
usage = The number of the stock (built-in) curve to use
tooltip =
manpage = 

[Field = MaximumInverse]
short = maxinv
long = MaximumInverse
type = F
usage = Maximum value for inverse of MTF (default 4.0)
tooltip =
manpage = Maximum value for inverse of MTF.  The inverse should always
be limited to reduce noise.

[Field = InverseRolloffRadiusSigma]
short = invrolloff
long = InverseRolloffRadiusSigma
type = FP
usage = Radius and sigma for gaussian roll-off of inverse to 1.0 (default 0.12
and 0.05)
tooltip =
manpage = 

[Field = XScaleFactor]
short = xscale
long = XScaleFactor
type = F
usage = Scaling factor X-axis of MTF curve (default 1.0)
tooltip =
manpage = Scaling factor for X-axis of MTF curve.  Scaling the X axis is 
probably an adequate way to adapt a curve from one camera or binning to 
another.

[Field = DensityScaleFactor]
short = denscale
long = DensityScaleFactor
type = F
usage = Density scaling factor (default 1.0)
tooltip =
manpage = Scaling factor for image intensities after filtering.

[Field = ParameterFile]
short=param
long=ParameterFile
type=PF
usage=Read parameter entries from file
tooltip=

[Field = usage]
short=help
long=usage
