[Field = InputFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input piece list or point file
tooltip = 
manpage = Input piece list or point file.  If this option is not entered and
-create is not entered, the first non-optional argument will be used for an
input file.

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output piece list or point file
tooltip = 
manpage = Output piece list or point file.  If this option is not entered, the 
second non-optional argument will be used if -create is not entered; otherwise
the first non-option argument will be used for an output file.

[Field = CreateForSections]
short = create
type = I
usage = Number of sections to create a new piece list for
tooltip = 
manpage = Number of sections to create a new piece list for

[Field = PiecesInXandY]
short = pieces
type = IP
usage = Number of pieces in X and Y in the newly created piece list
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = SpacingInXandY]
short = spacing
type = IP
usage = Spacing between pieces in created piece list (- for inverse order)
tooltip = 
manpage = Spacing between the pieces in X and Y in the newly created piece
list. Enter the negative of a spacing to have pieces coordinates put out in
inverse order, from high to low coordinates.  For how to determine the desired
spacing, see above.

[Field = ColumnsOfPieces]
short = columns
type = B
usage = Order pieces in created piece list in columns instead of rows
tooltip = 
manpage = Order pieces in a newly created piece list so that successive pieces
occur in columns (in Y) rather than in rows (in X).

[Field = StacksOfPieces]
short = stacks
type = I
usage = 1 to order pieces in created piece list first by Z, -1 for inverse Z order
tooltip = 
manpage = Order pieces in a newly created piece list so that successive pieces
go through the entire set Z values at each position in X and Y.  Enter 1 to
have pieces in order by Z, or -1 for pieces in inverse order.  This option can
be used together with the -columns option. 

[Field = DivideByBinning]
short = divide
type = I
usage = Adjust coordinates for images binned by the given factor
tooltip = 
manpage = This option can be used to make a new piece list that works with
binned images.  Rather than just dividing the existing coordinates by
the binning, the program determines a new overlap value and makes sure that
coordinates are regularly spaced apart.  To do this, it needs the image sizes
before and after binning, entered with -size and -binned.

[Field = NewOverlapInXandY]
short = overlap
type = IP
usage = Adjust coordinates to have the new overlap in X and Y
tooltip = 
manpage = This option can be used to change the overlap between pieces in a
piece list.  Enter the new overlaps in X and Y, and enter the size of the
pieces with the -size option.

[Field = SizeInXandY]
short = size
type = IP
usage = Size of pieces in X and Y (required to adjust overlap or divide by binning)
tooltip = 
manpage = Size of pieces in X and Y.  This entry is required to adjust overlap
or to divide by binning; in the latter case enter the full size of the
unbinned images to which the input piece list corresponds.

[Field = BinnedSizeInXandY]
short = binned
type = IP
usage = New, binned size of pieces in X and Y (required to divide by binning)
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = NewZList]
short = new
type = LI
usage = List of Z values to map old list to
tooltip = 
manpage = List of Z values to map old list to.  There must be as many values
in this list as in the list of Z values to remap.  See notes above on the
contents of this list.

[Field = AddToAllCoordinates]
short = add
type = FT
usage = Amount to add to all coordinates in X, Y, and Z, after remapping
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.

[Field = usage]
short = help
type = B
usage = Print help output
