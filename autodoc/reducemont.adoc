[Field = ImageInputFile]
short = imin
type = FN
usage = Image input file
tooltip =
manpage = Image input file, which may or may not be a montage.  If this option
is not entered, the first non-option argument is taken as the input file.

[Field = PieceListInput]
short = plin
type = FN
usage = File with list of piece coordinates for image input file
tooltip =
manpage = File with list of piece coordinates for image input file, if it is a
montage.

[Field = ImageOutputFile]
short = imout
type = FN
usage = Output file for montaged images
tooltip =
manpage = Output file for montaged images.  If this option
is not entered, the second non-option argument is taken as the output file.

[Field = PieceListOutput]
short = plout
type = FNM
usage = File for list of coordinates of pieces in output image file (required)
tooltip =
manpage = File for list of coordinates of pieces in output image file.  

[Field = SectionsToDo]
short = sections
type = LIM
usage = List of sections to use from input file, numbered from 0 (default all)
tooltip = 
manpage = List of sections to use from input file, numbered from 0.
Ranges may be entered (e.g., 1-3,5,8).
If no list is entered, all sections will be used.  Note that montages can have
missing sections, and a list that includes such missing sections will generate
an error.

[Field = ModeToOutput]
short = mode
type = I
usage = Storage mode of output file; 0 for byte, 1 or 6 for integer, 2 for real
tooltip = 
manpage = The storage mode of the output file; 0 for byte, 1 for 16-bit 
signed integer, 6 for 16-bit unsigned integer, or 2 for 32-bit floating point.
The default is the mode of the input file.

[Field = FloatToRange]
short = float
type = B
usage = Rescale densities of sections separately to fill data range
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = BinByFactor]
short = bin
type = I
usage = Use binning to reduce images in size by the given factor (default 1)
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = StartingAndEndingX]
short = xminmax
type = IP
usage = Minimum and maximum X index coordinates to output
tooltip = 
manpage = Minimum and maximum X index coordinates to output (numbered from 0).
The default is to output the entire image.

[Field = StartingAndEndingY]
short = yminmax
type = IP
usage = Minimum and maximum Y index coordinates to output
tooltip = 
manpage = Minimum and maximum Y index coordinates to output (numbered from 0).

[Field = MaximumFrameSizeXandY]
short = frame
type = IP
usage = Maximum size of output pieces in X and Y (default 0,0 for unlimited)
tooltip = 
manpage = Maximum size of output pieces in X and Y; pieces will be made
smaller as needed to divide the output region into equal pieces.  Enter 0,0 to
output data in a single frame (which is the default)

[Field = MinimumOverlapXandY]
short = overlap
type = IP
usage = Minimum overlap between output pieces in X and Y (default 0, 0)
tooltip = 
manpage = Minimum overlap between output pieces in X and Y.  Pieces may
overlap more than this as needed to divide the output region into equal
pieces.  The default is 0,0 for no overlap.

[Field = NoResizeForFFT]
short = nofft
type = B
usage = Do not increase output frame size to legal size for FFT
tooltip = 
manpage = Do not increase the size of the output to be suitable for taking an
FFT.  By default, output sizes are increased to have no higher prime factor
than 19.  This option suppresses that increase, and the only constraint is
that the output frame sizes be even.

[Field = LineLoadLimit]
short = line
type = I
usage = Maximum megabytes of memory allowed for loading a single-frame image
tooltip = 
manpage = When the input image is a single frame, it will be loaded in strips
when loading an entire section would take more than the given number of
meagabytes of memory.  The default is 1000.

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.

[Field = usage]
short = help
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage =
