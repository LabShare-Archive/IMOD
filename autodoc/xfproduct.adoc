manpage = Factors by which to scale X/Y translations of the first and second
transforms before multiplying them.  Use this option if a set of transforms
is derived from data that were scaled down (e.g., from a model on binned
images), so that the product transforms will apply to unscaled data.

usage = File with transforms applied first

manpage = File with transforms applied first.  If this option is not entered,
the first non-option argument will be used for this input file.

the second non-option argument will be used for this input file.

entered, the third non-option argument will be used for the output file.
