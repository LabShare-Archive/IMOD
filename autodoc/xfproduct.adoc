[Field = InputFile1]
short = in1
type = FN
usage = File with transforms applied first
tooltip = 
manpage = File with transforms applied first.  If this option is not entered,
the first non-option argument will be used for this input file.

[Field = InputFile2]
short = in2
type = FN
usage = File with transforms applied second
tooltip = 
manpage = File with transforms applied second.  If this option is not entered,
the second non-option argument will be used for this input file.

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output file for product transforms
tooltip = 
manpage = Output file C for product transforms.  If this option is not
entered, the third non-option argument will be used for the output file.

[Field = ScaleShifts]
short = scale
type = FP
usage = Factors to scale X/Y translations of the first and second transforms
tooltip = 
manpage = Factors by which to scale X/Y translations of the first and second
transforms before multiplying them.  Use this option if a set of transforms
is derived from data that were scaled down (e.g., from a model on binned
images), so that the product transforms will apply to unscaled data.

[Field = OneXformToMultiply]
short = one
type = I
usage = # of one transform to multiply by a single transform (numbered from 0)
tooltip = 
manpage = When one file has multiple transforms and the other has a single
transform, use this entry to have only one transform in the file of multiple
transforms be multiplied by the single transform.  Transforms are numbered
from zero.  This entry has no effect if both files have multiple transforms.
