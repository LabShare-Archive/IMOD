[Field = XMinAndMax]
short = xminmax
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending X index coordinates to extract
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending X index coordinates to extract into the output
volume (numbered from 0).
The default is to produce an output volume the same size as the input.  The X
and Y range of the output cannot be modified if the input is a Fourier
transform.

[Field = YMinAndMax]
short = yminmax
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending Y index coordinates to extract
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending Y index coordinates to extract into the output
volume (numbered from 0).

[Field = ZMinAndMax]
short = zminmax
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending slices to extract (numbered from 0)
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending Z slices to extract into the output
volume (numbered from 0).

[Field = InvertPaintedArea]
short = invert
type = B
usage = Invert: paint outside model contours instead of inside
tooltip = 
manpage = Paint outside model contours instead of inside.  This is
accomplished by painting inside the contours, then subtracting the painted
volume from the original volume.  This option cannot be used when making
colored data because the color is not defined outside of model objects.

[Field = ReverseContrast]
short = reverse
type = B
usage = Reverse contrast (subtract from file maximum) before painting
tooltip = 
manpage = Reverse the contrast by subtracting each value from the file maximum
before painting.  The intensity range being operated on thus ranges from 0 to
the original max minus the min.  For color input data, each channel is
subtracted from 255.  FFT input data may not be reversed.

[Field = Threshold]
short = thresh
type = F
usage = Set values below threshold to 0
tooltip = 
manpage = Set values below the given threshold to zero.  If contrast is being
reversed, the threshold will be converted to the appropriate value to use
after the reversal, so a value in the original data can be used.

[Field = FillValue]
short = fv
type = F
usage = Value to fill background with (default 0)
tooltip = 
manpage = Value with which to fill the background pixels that are not painted
with image data.  This is a value on the same scale as the values in the input
volume, before any reversal of contrast.  If you enter a value and also
select contrast reversal, the value is subtracted from the file maximum
before being tested for whether it fits in the range for the data mode.
The default is 0.  

[Field = FillColor]
short = fc
type = FT
usage = Relative RGB intensities for coloring the fill value (default 1,1,1)
tooltip = 
manpage = Relative values for scaling the value for background fill into a
red, green, and blue components for color output.  The values should be between
0 and 1.  The default is 1,1,1.

[Field = ObjectsToDo]
short = objects
type = LI
usage = Paint only for the given list of objects
tooltip = 
manpage = Paint only for the given list of objects.  The default is to do all
closed contour objects, all scattered point objects if -2dscat or -3dscat is
entered, and any open contour objects listed with -tube.

[Field = 2DScatteredPoints]
short = 2dscat
type = B
usage = Paint with scattered points treated as 2D circles
tooltip = 
manpage = Paint scattered point objects, but paint only a circle in the Z
plane of each point.  This would be useful for 2D FFTs.

[Field = 3DScatteredPoints]
short = 3dscat
type = B
usage = Paint with scattered points treated as 3D spheres
tooltip = 
manpage = Paint scattered point objects with each point treated as a sphere.
Options -2dscat and -3dscat are mutually exclusive.

[Field = TubeObjects]
short = tube
type = LI
usage = List of open contour objects to paint as tubes
tooltip = 
manpage = List of open contour objects for which to paint a cyclinder of
a particular diameter around each contour.

[Field = DiameterForTubes]
short = diam
type = F
usage = Diameter for tubes (1 value, or 1 value per listed object)
tooltip = 
manpage = Diameter for open contour objects being painted as tubes.  Enter
either 1 value, or 1 value per listed object.

[Field = ColorOutput]
short = color
type = B
usage = Produce RGB output colored by model object colors
tooltip = 
manpage = Produce RGB output colored by model object colors.  This option is
available only with byte, integer, or floating point input.

[Field = ScalingMinMax]
short = scale
type = FP
usage = Minimum and maximum values for scaling to bytes
tooltip = 
manpage = Minimum and maximum values for scaling to bytes, when a color volume
is being produced.  The default is to scale the min and max of the file to 
0 and 255 for input data modes other than bytes, but to leave bytes unscaled.
This entry should produce the same scaling as the -s option to 3dmod(1).

[Field = ProjectTiltSeries]
short = project
type = FT
usage = Produce projection series with given starting, ending, increment angles
tooltip = 
manpage = Produce projection series with given starting, ending, and increment
angles.  Projection is done with xyzproj(1), then data are read back in and
and scaled to bytes.  When color output is being produced, each painted color
channel is output separately and projected separately, then read back in and
combined into one RGB mode file.  Only byte, integer, or real data may be
projected.

[Field = AxisToTiltAround]
short = axis
type = CH
usage = Axis to tilt around for projections (X, Y, or Z; default is Y)
tooltip = 
manpage =

[Field = ConstantScaling]
short = constant
type = B
usage = Use constant scaling in projections
tooltip = 
manpage = When projecting with Xyzproj(1), scale all projections by the same
amount instead of dividing them by the number of pixels along the projection
ray at the particular angle.  This will give more even intensities through the
projection series for nearly spherical compact objects embedded in the black
background.

[Field = BlackAndWhite]
short = bw
type = IP
usage = Black/white values for scaling projections to bytes
tooltip = 
manpage = Black/white values for scaling projections to bytes.  By default,
the projections are scaled so that their min and max values map to 0 and 255.
With this option, scaled values below the black level are set to 0, ones above
the white level are set to 255, and values in between are remapped to 0 to
255.  The result is similar to reading the default scaled data into 3dmod and 
setting the black and white sliders to these values.

[Field = TemporaryDirectory]
short = tempdir
type = CH
usage = Directory for temporary files when projecting
tooltip = 
manpage =

[Field = KeepTempFiles]
short = keep
type = B
usage = Keep intermediate files when projecting
tooltip = 
manpage = Keep intermediate files when projecting.  2 or 6 intermediate
files are produced, depending on whether color output is being generated.
The temporary volume files are named imodmop.rec0.pid (and imodmop.rec1.pid 
and imodmop.rec2.pid for green and blue channels of color output), where pid
is the process ID.  The
temporary projection files are named imodmop.xyz0.pid, etc.
