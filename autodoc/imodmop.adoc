[Field = XMinAndMax]
short = xminmax
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending X index coordinates to extract
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending X index coordinates to extract into the output
volume (numbered from 0).
The default is to produce an output volume the same size as the input.  The X
and Y range of the output cannot be modified if the input is a Fourier
transform.

[Field = YMinAndMax]
short = yminmax
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending Y index coordinates to extract
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending Y index coordinates to extract into the output
volume (numbered from 0).

[Field = ZMinAndMax]
short = zminmax
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending slices to extract (numbered from 0)
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending Z slices to extract into the output
volume (numbered from 0).

[Field = BorderAroundObjects]
short = border
type = I
usage = Border in X and Y for extracting just the volume containing objects
tooltip = 
manpage = Use this option to extract just the volume necessary to contain all 
of the objects being painted, with the given border added in X and Y.  For
tubular lines, the radius of the tube is taken into account in determining the
limits to extract in X and Y and Z. For scattered points, the radius of each
point is taken into account in determining limits to extract in all 3
dimensions.  If padding is specified with the -pad option, the padding is
added only if it is positive.
If Z limits are entered with the -zminmax option, then they supercede the
Z limits computed from the objects with this option; this is the way to get
extra slices in Z.  This option cannot be used with -xminmax or -yminmax.

[Field = InvertPaintedArea]
short = invert
type = B
usage = Invert: paint outside model contours instead of inside
tooltip = 
manpage = Paint outside model contours instead of inside.  This is
accomplished by painting inside the contours, then subtracting the painted
volume from the original volume.  This option cannot be used when making
colored data because the color is not defined outside of model objects.

[Field = ReverseContrast]
short = reverse
type = B
usage = Reverse contrast (subtract from file maximum) before painting
tooltip = 
manpage = Reverse the contrast by subtracting each value from the file maximum
before painting.  The intensity range being operated on thus ranges from 0 to
the original max minus the min.  For color input data, each channel is
subtracted from 255.  FFT input data may not be reversed.

[Field = Threshold]
short = thresh
type = F
usage = Set values below threshold to 0
tooltip = 
manpage = Set values below the given threshold to zero.  If contrast is being
reversed, the threshold will be converted to the appropriate value to use
after the reversal, so a value in the original data can be used.

[Field = FillValue]
short = fv
type = F
usage = Value to fill background with (default 0)
tooltip = 
manpage = Value with which to fill the background pixels that are not painted
with image data.  This is a value on the same scale as the values in the input
volume, before any reversal of contrast.  If you enter a value and also
select contrast reversal, the value is subtracted from the file maximum
before being tested for whether it fits in the range for the data mode.
The default is 0.  

[Field = FillColor]
short = fc
type = FT
usage = Relative RGB intensities for coloring the fill value (default 1,1,1)
tooltip = 
manpage = Relative values for scaling the value for background fill into a
red, green, and blue components for color output.  The values should be between
0 and 1.  The default is 1,1,1.

[Field = MaskValue]
short = mask
type = F
usage = Value to use instead of existing pixel values, to make a binary mask
tooltip = 
manpage = With this option, the given value will be used to generate output
instead of the value in the input data.  In the simplest case, you can make a
mask volume that consists of zeros and ones by using "-mask 1".  You can
use the -invert option to produce the mask value outside the painted regions
and 0 inside.  A mask can be tapered with the -pad and -taper options.

[Field = ModeToOutput]
short = mode
type = I
usage = Output file mode (0: bytes, 1/6: signed/unsigned integers, 2: reals)
tooltip = 
manpage = Mode for output file: 0 for bytes, 1 or 6 for signed or unsigned
integers, or 2 for real values.  Changing the mode to 2 is essential if you
want to make a mask with a value of 1 and tapering over padded regions.  You
may also need to change output mode if you are inserting fill or mask values
outside the range of the input mode.  You cannot change the mode of FFT input
data, of RGB input data unless making or mask, or when using -color or -project.

[Field = PaddingSize]
short = pad
type = F
usage = Distance to pad around painted area, + for outside, - for inside
tooltip = 
manpage = This option will extend the painted region outside of the model
feature with a positive padding value, or eliminate pixels just inside the
boundary of the model feature with a negative padding value.  For 
a contour nested inside of another contour, the sense of the padding is reversed, with
a positive padding extending the painted area inside, and a negative
padding eliminating painted pixels outside.  For spheres, the padding size is
essentially added to the sphere radius.  For tubular contours, adding padding is
the same as entering a different tube diameter, unless tapering is being used.

[Field = TaperOverPad]
short = taper
type = I
usage = Type of tapering to background over padding region: 1 linear or 2 gaussian
tooltip = 
manpage = With this option, values will be tapered down to the background
value over a padding region.  Enter 1 for a taper that is linear with
distance, or 2 for a Gaussian that falls to 0.05 at the end of the tapering
distance.

[Field = ObjectsToDo]
short = objects
type = LI
usage = Paint only for the given list of objects
tooltip = 
manpage = Paint only for the given list of objects.  The default is to do all
closed contour objects, all scattered point objects if -2dscat or -3dscat is
entered, and any open contour objects listed with -tube.

[Field = 2DScatteredPoints]
short = 2dscat
type = B
usage = Paint with scattered points treated as 2D circles
tooltip = 
manpage = Paint scattered point objects, but paint only a circle in the Z
plane of each point.  This would be useful for 2D FFTs.

[Field = 3DScatteredPoints]
short = 3dscat
type = B
usage = Paint with scattered points treated as 3D spheres
tooltip = 
manpage = Paint scattered point objects with each point treated as a sphere.
Options -2dscat and -3dscat are mutually exclusive.

[Field = TubeObjects]
short = tube
type = LI
usage = List of open contour objects to paint as tubes
tooltip = 
manpage = List of open contour objects for which to paint a cyclinder of
a particular diameter around each contour.

[Field = DiameterForTubes]
short = diam
type = F
usage = Diameter for tubes (1 value, or 1 value per listed object)
tooltip = 
manpage = Diameter for open contour objects being painted as tubes.  Enter
either 1 value, or 1 value per listed object.

[Field = PlanarTubes]
short = planar
type = B
usage = Paint open contours only in the plane where a segment lies
tooltip = 
manpage = With this open, open contours identified as being painted as tubes
will be painted in 2D only.  For each segment of the contour that lies in one
Z plane, pixels will be extracted in that Z plane only.

[Field = AllSectionObjects]
short = allsec
type = LI
usage = List of objects to paint on all sections
tooltip = 
manpage = List of closed contour or scattered point objects to paint on all
sections.  For example, a cylinder will be painted for each sphere regardless
of its Z location. 

[Field = ColorOutput]
short = color
type = B
usage = Produce RGB output colored by model object colors
tooltip = 
manpage = Produce RGB output colored by model object colors.  This option is
available only with byte, integer, or floating point input.

[Field = ScalingMinMax]
short = scale
type = FP
usage = Minimum and maximum values for scaling to bytes
tooltip = 
manpage = Minimum and maximum values for scaling to bytes, when a color volume
is being produced.  The default is to scale the min and max of the file to 
0 and 255 for input data modes other than bytes, but to leave bytes unscaled.
This entry should produce the same scaling as the -s option to 3dmod(1).

[Field = ProjectTiltSeries]
short = project
type = FT
usage = Produce projection series with given starting, ending, increment angles
tooltip = 
manpage = Produce projection series with given starting, ending, and increment
angles.  Projection is done with xyzproj(1), then data are read back in and
and scaled to bytes.  When color output is being produced, each painted color
channel is output separately and projected separately, then read back in and
combined into one RGB mode file.  Only byte, integer, or real data may be
projected.

[Field = AxisToTiltAround]
short = axis
type = CH
usage = Axis to tilt around for projections (X, Y, or Z; default is Y)
tooltip = 
manpage =

[Field = ConstantScaling]
short = constant
type = B
usage = Use constant scaling in projections
tooltip = 
manpage = When projecting with Xyzproj(1), scale all projections by the same
amount instead of dividing them by the number of pixels along the projection
ray at the particular angle.  This will give more even intensities through the
projection series for nearly spherical compact objects embedded in the black
background.

[Field = BlackAndWhite]
short = bw
type = IP
usage = Black/white values for scaling projections to bytes
tooltip = 
manpage = Black/white values for scaling projections to bytes.  By default,
the projections are scaled so that their min and max values map to 0 and 255.
With this option, scaled values below the black level are set to 0, ones above
the white level are set to 255, and values in between are remapped to 0 to
255.  The result is similar to reading the default scaled data into 3dmod and 
setting the black and white sliders to these values.

[Field = TemporaryDirectory]
short = tempdir
type = CH
usage = Directory for temporary files when projecting
tooltip = 
manpage =

[Field = KeepTempFiles]
short = keep
type = B
usage = Keep intermediate files when projecting
tooltip = 
manpage = Keep intermediate files when projecting.  2 or 6 intermediate
files are produced, depending on whether color output is being generated.
The temporary volume files are named imodmop.rec0.pid (and imodmop.rec1.pid 
and imodmop.rec2.pid for green and blue channels of color output), where pid
is the process ID.  The
temporary projection files are named imodmop.xyz0.pid, etc.

[Field = FastLegacyMethod]
short = fast
type = B
usage = Paint closed contours using old fast and approximate method.
tooltip = 
manpage = Paint closed contours using scan contours, the method used prior to
IMOD 4.2.15.  This was about 10 times faster but was not completely accurate
at identifying the pixels within contours, particularly if they were the
contours small or convoluted.
