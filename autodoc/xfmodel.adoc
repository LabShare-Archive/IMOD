will be found.

[Field = ImageFile]
short = image
long = ImageFile
type = FN
usage = Image file that model was built on (optional)
tooltip =
manpage = Image file that model was built on, used to determine center
coordinate for transformations.  If neither this nor CenterInXandY are
entered, the image size will be used from the model header.

[Field = PieceListFile]
short = piece
long = PieceListFile
type = FN
usage = Name of piece list file for a montaged image file
tooltip =
manpage =

[Field = AllZhaveTransforms]
short = allz
long = AllZhaveTransforms
type = B
usage = All Z values have transforms in even though the image has gaps in Z
tooltip =
manpage = When there is a list of piece coordinates that has gaps in the Z
values, use this entry to indicate that transform files have transforms for
all Z values; otherwise the files will be assumed to have matching gaps in Z.

[Field = CenterInXandY]
short = center
long = CenterInXandY
type = FP
usage = Center coordinates of image in X and Y (optional)
tooltip =
manpage = Center coordinates of image in X and Y.  If neither this nor 
ImageFile are entered, the image size will be used from the model header.

[Field = TranslationOnly]
short = transonly
long = TranslationOnly
type = B
usage = Solve only for translations in X and Y
tooltip =
manpage = Solve for transformations that include only translations in X and Y.

[Field = RotationTranslation]
short = rottrans
long = RotationTranslation
type = B
usage = Solve for rotations and translations
tooltip =
manpage = Solve for transformations that include rotations and translations.

[Field = MagRotTrans]
short = magrot
long = MagRotTrans
type = B
usage = Solve for magnifications, rotations, and translations
tooltip =
manpage = Solve for transformations that include magnifications, rotations 
and translations, i.e. no stretch.

[Field = SectionsToAnalyze]
short = sections
long = SectionsToAnalyze
type = LI
usage = Sections to find transformations for (numbered from 0)
tooltip =
manpage = List of sections to find transformations for. identified by the 
second one of each pair, numbered from 0.  The default is all sections.

[Field = SingleSection]
short = single
long = SingleSection
type = I
usage = Align all sections to the given section
tooltip =
manpage = Align all sections to a single reference section with the given
section number.

[Field = FullReportMeanAndMax]
short = full
long = FullReportMeanAndMax
type = FP
usage = Criterion mean deviation and maximum deviation for full report on a 
section
tooltip =
manpage = A detailed report will be printed for any section that exceeds either
the given mean deviation or the given maximum deviation.

[Field = PrealignTransforms]
short = prealign
long = PrealignTransforms
type = FN
usage = File of g transforms used to prealign the images modeled
tooltip =
manpage = File of g transforms that were used to prealign the images on which
the model was built

[Field = EditTransforms]
short = edit
long = EditTransforms
type = FN
usage = File with existing transforms to be replaced by any transforms found
tooltip =
manpage = Name of file with existing f transforms to be replaced by any
transforms that are solved for

[Field = XformsToApply]

type = FN
usage = Transforms to apply to the model
tooltip =
manpage = File of g transforms to apply to transform the model

[Field = BackTransform]
short = back
long = BackTransform
type = B
usage = Back-transform or re-distort model
tooltip =
manpage = If no distortion field is involved, apply the inverse of the
transforms specified by PrealignTransforms or XformsToApply.  Either
of these two options may be used to specify transforms, but not both.  If
a distortion field is specified, this option can be used to transform a model
built on undistorted images to match original images.

[Field = DistortionField]
short = distort
long = DistortionField
type = FN
usage = Undistort/redistort model with image distortion field in this file
tooltip = 
manpage = File with image distortion field to be applied in transforming model.
If BackTransform is specified, the model will be redistorted, i.e. transformed
to match original distorted images.

[Field = BinningOfImages]
short = binning
long = BinningOfImages
type = I
usage = The camera binning at which images were taken
tooltip = 
manpage = The camera binning at which images were taken.  This entry may be
required when undistorting if the program cannot deduce the binning
unambiguously.

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
long = ParameterFile
