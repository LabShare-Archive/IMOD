type = FN
usage = Input model file
tooltip = 
manpage = Input model file to be transformed, or from which transformations 
will be found.

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output file, either transformed model or list of transformations.

manpage =

[Field = ImageFile]
short = image
type = FN
usage = Image file that model was built on (optional)
tooltip =
manpage = Image file that model was built on, used to determine center
coordinate for transformations.  If neither this nor CenterInXandY are
entered, the image size will be used from the model header.

[Field = PieceListFile]
short = piece
type = FN
usage = Name of piece list file for a montaged image file
tooltip =
manpage =

[Field = AllZhaveTransforms]
short = allz
type = B
usage = All Z values have transforms in even though the image has gaps in Z
tooltip =
manpage = When there is a list of piece coordinates that has gaps in the Z
values, use this entry to indicate that transform files have transforms for
all Z values; otherwise the files will be assumed to have matching gaps in Z.

[Field = CenterInXandY]
short = center
type = FP
usage = Center coordinates of image in X and Y (optional)
tooltip =
manpage = Center coordinates of image in X and Y.  If neither this nor 
ImageFile are entered, the image size will be used from the model header.

[Field = TranslationOnly]
short = transonly
type = B
usage = Solve only for translations in X and Y
tooltip =
manpage = Solve for transformations that include only translations in X and Y.

[Field = RotationTranslation]
short = rottrans
type = B
usage = Solve for rotations and translations
tooltip =
manpage = Solve for transformations that include rotations and translations.

[Field = MagRotTrans]
short = magrot
type = B
usage = Solve for magnifications, rotations, and translations
tooltip =
manpage = Solve for transformations that include magnifications, rotations 
and translations, i.e. no stretch.

[Field = SectionsToAnalyze]
short = sections
type = LI
usage = Sections to find transformations for (numbered from 0)
tooltip =
manpage = List of sections to find transformations for. identified by the 
second one of each pair, numbered from 0.  The default is all sections.

[Field = SingleSection]
short = single
type = I
usage = Align all sections to the given section
tooltip =
manpage = Align all sections to a single reference section with the given
section number.

[Field = FullReportMeanAndMax]
short = full
type = FP
usage = Criterion mean deviation and maximum deviation for full report on a 
section
tooltip =
manpage = A detailed report will be printed for any section that exceeds either
the given mean deviation or the given maximum deviation.

[Field = PrealignTransforms]
short = prealign
type = FN
usage = File of g transforms used to prealign the images modeled
tooltip =
manpage = File of g transforms that were used to prealign the images on which
the model was built

[Field = EditTransforms]
short = edit
type = FN
usage = File with existing transforms to be replaced by any transforms found
tooltip =
manpage = Name of file with existing f transforms to be replaced by any
transforms that are solved for

[Field = XformsToApply]
short = xforms
type = FN
usage = Transforms to apply to the model
tooltip =
manpage = File of g transforms to apply to transform the model

[Field = UseTransformLine]
short = useline
type = I
usage = Line number of single transform to apply to whole model (numbered 
from 0)
tooltip =
manpage = Line number of single transform to apply to all points in model,
regardless of their Z values.  Line numbers start at 0.  This option can be
used only when forward or back-transforming the model.  This option will be
invoked automatically if there is only one transform in the file. 
If prealignment
transforms are specified when transforming or undistorting a model, they will
be applied as usual, with a separate transform used for each Z value.

[Field = ChunkSizes]
short = chunks
type = LI
usage = Size of chunk of sections corresponding to each transform in file
tooltip =
manpage = If the model consists of a set of blocks in Z, such as a model
built on a set of serial tomograms, then this option can be used to apply
one transform per chunk of Z values.  Enter a list giving the number of 
sections in each chunk.  Z values beyond the total of these chunk sizes will
not be transformed.  The same chunk structure will be used when applying
prealignment transforms if -prealign is entered.

[Field = BackTransform]
short = back
type = B
usage = Back-transform or re-distort model
tooltip =
manpage = If no distortion field is involved, apply the inverse of the
transforms specified by -prealign or -xforms.  Either
of these two options may be used to specify transforms, but not both.  If
a distortion field or mag gradient is specified, this option can be used to
transform a model
built on undistorted images to match original images.  In this case, 
prealignment transforms will be treated differently depending on how they
are specified: with -xforms, the model will be back-transformed to match
the raw images; with -prealign, the model will be transformed to match
prealigned but distorted images.

[Field = ScaleShifts]
short = scale
type = F
usage = Factor to scale X/Y translations before applying transforms 
factors
tooltip = 
manpage = Factor by which to scale X/Y translations in the transforms before
applying them.  Use this option if a set of transforms is appropriate for
images at one scale but the model was built on images at another scale.  For
example, if images are scaled by binning, the factor would be the binning of
the images that the transforms apply to, divided by the binning of the images
on which the model was built.

[Field = DistortionField]
short = distort
type = FN
usage = Undistort/redistort model with image distortion field in this file
tooltip = 
manpage = File with image distortion field to be applied in transforming model.
If BackTransform is specified, the model will be redistorted, i.e. transformed
to match original distorted images.

[Field = BinningOfImages]
short = binning
type = I
usage = The camera binning at which images were taken
tooltip = 
manpage = The camera binning at which images were taken.  This entry may be
required when undistorting if the program cannot deduce the binning
unambiguously.

[Field = GradientFile]
short  = gradient
type = FN
usage = File with magnification gradients to be applied for each Z value
tooltip = 
manpage = File with magnification gradients to be applied for each image.
This should be a file listing the tilt angle, the percent magnification change
per micron of Z height, and the degrees of rotation per micron of Z height
for each image, such as is produced by Extractmaggrad.  The mag gradient
correction is applied before a distortion field correction and before any
transformations.

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.

[Field = usage]
