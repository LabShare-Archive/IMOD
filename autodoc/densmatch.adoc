[Field = ReferenceFile]
short = reference
long = ReferenceFile
type = FN
usage = Input file with reference volume (the one being matched to)
tooltip =
manpage = Input file with reference volume (the one being matched to).  This
file can be entered on the command line as the first non-option argument.  

[Field = ScaledFile]
short = scaled
long = ScaledFile
type = FN
usage = Input file with volume to be scaled to match
tooltip =
manpage = Input file with volume to be scaled to match.  This
file can be entered on the command line as the second non-option argument. 

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
long = OutputFile
type = FN
usage = Output file for scaled volume (omit to rewrite input file)
tooltip =
manpage = Output file for the scaled volume.  This
file can be entered on the command line as the third non-option argument. 
If this file is omitted, the
program will write the scaled values back to the input file.

[Field = ReportOnly]
short = report
long = ReportOnly
type = B
usage = Report scaling factors without writing scaled data to file
tooltip =
manpage = Report scaling factors without writing scaled data to file.  The
program will report two numbers, a factor to multiply by then a constant to
add; these numbers can be supplied to the -multadd option of Newstack.

[Field = XMinAndMax]
short = xminmax
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending X coordinates of region to analyze in reference
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending X coordinates of region to analyze for mean and
SD in reference volume.  The default is NX/4, 3*NX/4, where NX is the size of
the reference volume in X.  X, Y, and Z coordinates are numbered from 0.

[Field = YMinAndMax]
short = yminmax
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending Y coordinates of region to analyze in reference
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending Y coordinates of region to analyze in reference
volume.  The default is NY/4, 3*NY/4, where NY is the size of
the reference volume in Y.

[Field = ZMinAndMax]
short = zminmax
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending Z coordinates of region to analyze in reference
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending Z values of region to analyze in reference
volume.  The default is NZ/4, 3*NZ/4, where NZ is the number of slices in
the reference volume.

[Field = OffsetRefToScaledXYZ]
short = offset
type = IT
usage = Displacement of scaled volume relative to reference in X, Y, and Z
tooltip = 
manpage = Displacement of the volume being scaled relative to the
reference volume in X, Y, and Z;
namely, the amount to add to a pixel coordinate in the reference volume to
obtain the coordinate of the corresponding pixel in the file being scaled.
