[Field = DirectiveFile]
short = directive
type = FNM
usage = Input file with directives for automating one or more data sets
tooltip = 
manpage = Input file with directives for automating one or more data sets.
The filename must end in .adoc.  All non-option arguments will be taken as
such input files.  

[Field = RootName]
short = root
type = FNM
usage = Root name of data set (omit a or b for dual-axis set)
tooltip = 
manpage = A data set name can be provided with this option to override the
name contained in the directive file, thus allowing directive files to be
reused without editing.  If this
option is used, the number of directive files must be either one or the same
as the number of root names.  The current location of the tilt series must be indicated
with the -current option if only one directive file is entered with multiple
root names.

[Field = CurrentLocation]
short = current
type = FNM
usage = Directory where tilt series currently resides
tooltip = 
manpage = Directory where tilt series is currently located.  This entry
overrides the dataset directory contained in the directive file.  It can be
used in two different ways.  If the -deliver option is entered, this option
can be entered only once, and it must be the directory where all tilt series
will be moved from.  If the -deliver option is not entered, then this option
specifies the directory where the data set will be processed and must be
entered once for each data set.

[Field = DeliverToDirectory]
short = deliver
type = FN
usage = Make a subdirectory of this directory for each data set
tooltip = 
manpage = Make a subdirectory of the specified directory for each data set,
named with the root name of the data set, and move the tilt series into the
subdirectory.  An associated metadata file named as the tilt series filename
plus ".mdoc" will also be moved.  The -current option must be entered once.

[Field = ProcessOneAxis]
short = one
type = I
usage = 1 to do only A axis, 2 to do only B axis of dual axis data set
tooltip = 
manpage = Enter 1 to do setup and process A axis, or 2 to skip setup and
process only B axis.  This entry applies to all dual-axis data sets being
run.

[Field = CPUMachineList]
short = cpus
type = CH
usage = Machines to use in parallel processing, or number of local cores
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = SingleOnFirstCPU]
short = single
type = B
usage = Run single command files on first machine in CPU list
tooltip = 
manpage = Run single command files on the first machine in the CPU list, instead of
on the local machine.

[Field = GPUMachineList]
short = gpus
type = CH
usage = Machines to use for parallel processing with a GPU, or 1 for local GPU
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = NiceValue]
short = nice
type = I
usage = Priority level or niceness for running jobs; default is 15
tooltip = 
manpage = Priority level or niceness for running jobs.  Note that this applies
to all computations, not just those run with parallel processing.  The default is 15.

[Field = RemoteDirectory]
short = remote
type = FN
usage = Path to starting directory on remote machines
tooltip = 
manpage = Path on remote machines to directory from which this program is started.

[Field = CheckFile]
short = check
type = FN
usage = File to check for quit signals
tooltip = 
manpage = File to check for quit signals.  The default is batchrunner###.input
in the directory where this program is started, where ### is the process ID.
The file is passed to processchunks when it runs jobs, and is checked before
and after running jobs.  Only a Q should be placed in this file.  This will
terminate any running jobs and stop all processing.

[Field = ValidationType]
short = validation
type = I
usage = 0/1/2 to validate directives (1/2 to do this then exit), or -1 not to
tooltip = 
manpage = By default, the program will check all directives in the directive
and template files against the master list of directives in
IMOD_DIR/com/directives.csv.  Enter 1 to run the program just to check
a directive file and exit, 2 to check a template file and exit, or -1 to skip
this step.  When checking a directive file, the directive file is first processed to
find certain required values, and an error in that step will prevent the
checking of directives.  Template files referenced by the directive file will
be checked as well.  With an entry of 2, the file will be checked right after
reading.  A batch directive file is required to contain only directives with a
Y in the "Batch" column of the master directives file, and a template file
must contain only directives with a Y in the "Tmplt" column.

[Field = StartingStep]
short = start
type = I
usage = Step to start at for first set, or 100 plus step for second axis
tooltip = 
manpage = "Step to start with for first set: 0 = setup, 1 = preprocessing, 2 =
xcorr, 3 = prealigned stack, 4 = patch tracking or seeding or RAPTOR, 5 =
beadtrack, 6 = aligned stack, 7 = CTF correction, 8 = erase gold, 9 = filter,
10 = reconstruction.  Add 100 to start with this step in the second axis of a
dual-axis data set."

[Field = EndingStep]
short = end
type = I
usage = Step to end with
tooltip = 
manpage = Step to end with in each set and axis.  Steps are numbered as
described for -start.

[Field = ExitOnError]
short = exit
type = B
usage = Exit on error instead of going on to next axis or data set
tooltip =
manpage =
