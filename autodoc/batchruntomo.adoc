short = directive
type = FNM
usage = Input file with directives for automating one data set
tooltip = 
manpage = Input file with directives for automating one data set.  All
non-option arguments will be taken as such input files.

short = cpus

usage = Machines to use in parallel processing, or number of local cores

[Field = SingleOnFirstCPU]
short = single
type = B
usage = Run single command files on first machine in CPU list
tooltip = 
manpage = Run single command files on the first machine in the CPU list, instead of
on the local machine.

[Field = NiceValue]

type = I
usage = Priority level or niceness for running jobs; default is 15
tooltip = 
manpage = Priority level or niceness for running jobs.  Note that this applies
to all computations, not just those run with parallel processing.  The default is 15.

[Field = RemoteDirectory]
short = remote
type = FN
usage = Path to starting directory on remote machines
tooltip = 
manpage = Path on remote machines to directory from which this program is started.

[Field = CheckFile]
short = check
type = FN
usage = File to check for quit signals
tooltip = 
manpage = File to check for quit signals.  The default is batchrunner###.input
in the directory where this program is started, where ### is the process ID.
The file is passed to processchunks when it runs jobs, and is checked before
and after running jobs.  Only a Q should be placed in this file.  This will
terminate any running jobs and stop all processing.

[Field = ValidationType]
short = validation
type = I
usage = 0/1/2 to validate directives (1/2 to do this then exit), or -1 not to
tooltip = 
manpage = By default, the program will check all directives in the directive
and template files against the master list of directives in
IMOD_DIR/com/directives.csv.  Enter 1 to run the program just to check
a directive file and exit, 2 to check a template file and exit, or -1 to skip
this step.  When checking a directive file, the directive file is first processed to
find certain required values, and an error in that step will prevent the
checking of directives.  Template files referenced by the directive file will
be checked as well.  With an entry of 2, the file will be checked right after
reading, it is not required to contain the values expected in a directive
file, and directives pointing to template files will be ignored.

dual-axis data set."
