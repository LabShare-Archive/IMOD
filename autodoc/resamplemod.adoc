[Field = ExcludeObjects]

usage = Objects to exclude from resampling
tooltip = 
manpage = Objects to exclude from resampling; for example, closed contour
objects. 

[Field = DirectionObjects]
short = direction
long = DirectionObjects
type = LI
usage = Objects to use to determine mean direction of fibers
tooltip = 
manpage = Objects to use to determine mean direction of fibers.  The
default is to use all of the objects; enter a list to use a subset of
objects, or just a single object number if you have created a special
object with a contour to indicate the direction.

[Field = MainAxis]
short = main
long = MainAxis
type = I
usage = Dominant axis along which fibers run (1 = X, 2 = Y, 3 = Z; default = 3)
tooltip = 
manpage = Dominant axis along which fibers run (1 = X, 2 = Y, or 3 = Z.)
The default is the Z axis (3), which is appropriate for serial section
models.  A different axis is generally needed for a model from a tomogram.
If the model was built on a tomogram loaded into 3dmod with flipping (-Y),
enter a number that refers to the axis that was seen in 3dmod.

[Field = SkipInversion]
short = skip
long = SkipInversion
type = B
usage = Do not invert contours that go from high to low along main axis
tooltip = 
manpage = Do not invert contours that go from high to low along the main
axis.  The default is the reorder contours if necessary so that they go
from low Z to high Z in the output model.

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
long = ParameterFile
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries from file.
