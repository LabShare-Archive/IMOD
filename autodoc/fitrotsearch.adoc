usage = Input file with output from matchrotpairs
tooltip = 
manpage = Input file with output from matchrotpairs.  Two kinds of input files
will be recognized: the complete output from Matchrotpairs, or a file with
only the numeric output extracted, namely the views in A and B, the rotation
angle, and the difference.

[Field = AViewsStartAndEnd]
short = aviews
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending views from A to include in fit (default is all)

[Field = OrderOfPolynomial]
short = order
type = I
usage = Order of polynomial to fit to data (default is 2, or 3 if > 25 points)
tooltip = 
manpage = Order of polynomial to fit to the data.  A third order polynomial
involves a fit to 9 terms and a second order polynomial involves a fit to 5
terms.  The default is 2, or 3 if there are more than 25 points.
