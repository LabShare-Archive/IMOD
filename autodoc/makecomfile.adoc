[Field = InputFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input file to copy commands from (optional)
tooltip = 
manpage = Input file to copy commands from; this entry is not required for all
types of files.  Because of this, the input file cannot be entered as a
non-option argument.

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output file for commands (required)
tooltip = 
manpage = Output file for commands, a required entry.  The filename determines
the type of output, and must start with
xcorr_pt, autofidseed, transferfid, newst_3dfind, blend_3dfind, tilt_3dfind_reproject,
tilt_3dfind,  findbeads3d, golderaser, or sirtsetup.  If this option is not
entered, the first (not second) non-option argument is taken as the output file.

[Field = RootNameOfDataFiles]
short = root
type = CH
usage = Root name of data files, including axis letter
tooltip = 
manpage =

[Field = SingleAxis]
short = single
type = B
usage = Dataset is single axis (overrides last letter of output file root name)
tooltip = 
manpage = This entry can be used to indicate that the dataset is single axis
even though the output com file name ends in "a" or "b".  It is not needed
with any of the currently defined output file types.

[Field = BinningOfImages]
short = binning
type = I
usage = Binning value to place in command file
tooltip = 
manpage = Binning value to place in command file, which is required by many
types of files.

[Field = BeadSize]
short = bead
type = F
usage = Bead size in pixels, needed for findbeads3d
tooltip = 
manpage = Bead size in pixels, required for findbeads3d.

[Field = Use3dfindAliInput]
short = use
type = B
usage = Change input file to setname_3dfind.ali if needed for tilt_3dfind
tooltip = 
manpage =

[Field = ThicknessToMake]
short = thickness
type = I
usage = Thickness to make the reconstruction, required for tilt_3dfind
tooltip = 
manpage =

[Field = ShiftInY]
short = shift
type = F
usage = Amount to shift reconstruction in Y in tilt_3dfind
tooltip = 
manpage =

[Field = ChangeParametersFile]
short = change
type = FNM
usage = Name of file with directives for changing parameters
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of file with directives for changing parameters.  A directive
has the form "comparam.comfile.process.option=value" where "comparam" is a required
prefix for directives to be processed by Copytomocoms, "comfile" is the root
name of the command file with optional "a" or "b", "process" is the name of a
program being run on a line starting with "$", "option" is an option to add
or modify, and "value" is its value, which may be empty to remove an option
from a command list.  Files are processed in order, and
a duplicate entry for an option generally overrides an earlier one or any
changes imposed by this script.  However,
for a dual-axis data set, a directive specific to a particular axis, such as
that example, will always be preferred over a generic directive with no "a" or
"b" on the command file name will.  For a single-axis data set, directives
with a "b" are ignored and ones with an "a" or with no "a or "b" are treated
equivalently, such that later ones override earlier ones.

[Field = OneParameterChange]
short = one
type = CHM
usage = One directive for changing parameters
tooltip = 
manpage = One directive for changing parameters, in the format 
"comparam.comfile.process.option=value".
Entries with this option are processed after change files, can override any
standard changes or additions being imposed by the script, and later entries
override earlier ones
