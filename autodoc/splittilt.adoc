[Field = CommandFile]
type = FN
usage =  Tilt command file, with or without extension
tooltip =
manpage = Tilt command file.  It can be entered with or without extension,
i.e., as "tilt", "tilt.", or "tilt.com".

[Field = ProcessorNumber]
short = n
type = I
usage = Target or expected number of machines (default 8)
tooltip =
manpage = The number of machines that you expect to run
the command files on.  The default is 8

[Field = SliceMinimum]
short = s
type = I
usage = Minimum number of slices per chunk (default 50)
tooltip =
manpage =

[Field = TargetChunks]
short = t
type = I
usage = Target number of chunks (default 5 times expected # of machines)
tooltip =
manpage =

[Field = ChunkMinimum]
short = m
type = I
usage = Minimum number of chunks (default 2 times expected # of machines)
tooltip =
manpage = Minimum number of chunks, except when vertical slices are specified
with the -v option.  The default is 2 times the expected number of machines,
but with vertical slices, the minimum becomes one chunk per machine.

[Field = OldStyleXtiltPenalty]
short = p
type = F
usage = Computational penalty for old-style X-axis tilting (default 1.33)
tooltip =
manpage =

[Field = VerticalSlices]
short = v
type = B
usage = Do vertical slices instead of old-style X-axis tilting
tooltip =
manpage = Do vertical slices instead of old-style X-axis tilting, regardless
of the penalty.

[Field = SeparateChunks]
short = c
type = B
usage = Write chunks to separate files, not directly to single output file
tooltip =
manpage = Write chunks to separate files named setname-nnn.rec and assemble
the output file from these at the end.  The default is to write directly to
the output file.

[Field = BoundaryPixels]
short = b
type = I
usage = Number of boundary pixels for direct writing
tooltip =
manpage = Number of pixels at each boundary between chunks to save in separate
boundary files (named setname-nnn.rbound) and rewrite to the output file in
the -finish.com file, when directly writing to the output file.  The default
is 2048.  This capability to rewrite lines at the boundary should make it
unnecessary to write chunks to separate files.

[Field = InitialComNumber]
short = i
type = I
usage = Initial command file number
tooltip =
manpage = Start with given command file number instead of 1.  When this option
is entered, the program will not delete any existing command files.  If data
are being written directly to output file, the first file is named
-nnn-sync.com instead of -start.com.

[Field = OpenForMoreComs]
short = o
type = B
usage = Leave command file set open, finish with -sync instead of -finish
tooltip =
manpage = Leave the command file set open by naming the command file for
reassembly -nnn-sync.com instead of -finish.com, and by not cleaning up
command and log files in the reassembly file.

[Field = DimensionsOfStack]
short = d
type = IP
usage = X and Y size of aligned stack
tooltip =
manpage = Use the given values as the dimensions of the aligned stack.
This option is needed when calling from Sirtsetup(1) if the log
of the stack is being used or if a subarea is being done.
