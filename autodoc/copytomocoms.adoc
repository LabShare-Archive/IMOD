manpage = Set the standard pixel spacing in the header of each image file if
it comes from FEI software.  The pixel size from the extended header will be
multiplied by the binning of the images, if any, and placed in the standard
header location, so that it will propagate through the processing.  If there
is already a standard pixel spacing not equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4, it will not be
modified.

[Field = ChangeParametersFile]
short = change
type = FNM
usage = Name of file with directives for changing parameters
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of file with directives for changing parameters.  A directive
has the form "comparam.comfile.process.option=value" where "comparam" is a required
prefix for directives to be processed by Copytomocoms, "comfile" is the root
name of the command file with optional "a" or "b", "process" is the name of a
program being run on a line starting with "$", "option" is an option to add
or modify, and "value" is its value.  An example is
"comparam.xcorra.tiltxcorr.FilterSigma1=0.02".  Files are processed in order, and
a duplicate entry for an option generally overrides an earlier one.  However,
for a dual-axis data set, a directive specific to a particular axis, such as
that example, will always be preferred over a generic directive with no "a" or
"b" on the command file name will.  For a single-axis data set, directives
with a "b" are ignored and ones with an "a" or with no "a or "b" are treated
equivalently, such that later ones override earlier ones.

[Field = OneParameterChange]
short = one
type = CHM
usage = One directive for changing parameters
tooltip = 
manpage = One directive for changing parameters, in the format just described.
Entries with this option are processed after, and can override, ones entered
from files, and later ones override earlier ones.
