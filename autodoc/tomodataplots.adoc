[Field = InputFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Name of data file
tooltip =
manpage = Name of file with data to plot.  If this option is not entered, the
first non-option argument is used for the name.

[Field = TypeOfDataToPlot]
short = type
type = IA
usage = Type of data to plot (1-3: transforms, 4: blendmont, 5-10: tiltalign,
11-12: clip stat)
tooltip =
manpage = Type of data to plot.  
^  1-3: Shifts from a transform file; 1 for X shift, 2 for Y shifts, 3 for both.
^  4: Mean and maximum errors in a Blendmont(1) log versus view number.
^  5-10: Solution parameters from a Tiltalign(1) log versus view number:
^        5 for rotation, 
^        6 for delta tilt and skew if present,
^        7 for magnification, 
^        8 for X-stretch (dmag), 
^        9 for global mean residual, and
^       10 for the average of the mean residual over all local areas
^  11-13: 11 for minimum, 12 for maximum, and 13 for both values from "clip
stats" output plotted versus view number or versus piece number for a montage.

[Field = ConnectWithLines]
short = connect
type = I
usage = 1 to draw lines between successive points, 0 not to.
tooltip =
manpage = To override the default on whether connecting lines are drawn, enter
1 draw lines between successive points, or 0 not to.
This entry has no effect if the symbol is 0 (no symbol).

[Field = SymbolsForGroups]
short = symbols
type = IA
usage = One or more symbols to use for the different types or columns
tooltip =
manpage = One or more symbols to use for the different types or columns being
displayed.  See onegenplot(1) for a list of symbol types.

[Field = HueOfGroup]
short = hue
type = CHM
usage = Group number, and color name or red, green, blue (0-255)
tooltip =
manpage = This option can be used to specify a color for each group being
plotted.  If one type of data is being plotted, the group number is 1 and
default color is black.  When two types of data are being plotted, the
group numbers are 1 and 2 and the default colors are navy and maroon.
Enter either 4 integers separated by commas 
(the group number and the red, green, and blue values, ranging from 0 to 255)
or the group number and a stock color name separated by a comma.  An entry
here replaces the default for that group.  Stock colors can be listed with
"onegenplot -stock".
