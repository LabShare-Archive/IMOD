type = B
usage = Resume, retaining existing finished files (the default is to remove
all log files and redo everything)
tooltip = 
manpage = Resume processing and retain all existing log files.  The default is
to remove all existing log files, run rootname-start.com if it exists, and
then run all of the individual command files, finishing with
rootname-finish.com if it exists.  With this option, the program
will not rerun any command files whose corresponding log files end with "CHUNK
DONE", including the start and finish files.

[Field = s]
type = B
usage = Run a single command file named root_name or root_name.com
tooltip = 
manpage = Run a single command file on a remote machine (i.e., the first
machine in machine list).  The command file is not required to be numbered.
The rootname given on the command line can be either the full name or the name
excluding ".com".

[Field = g]
type = B
usage = Go process, without asking for confirmation after probing machines
tooltip = 
manpage = Go start processing after probing the machines, without waiting for
confirmation from the user.

[Field = n]
type = I
usage = Set the "nice" value to the given number (default 18, range 0-19)
tooltip = 
manpage = Run jobs with "niceness" set to the given value, which can range
from 0 for no reduction in priority to 19 for maximum reduction.  The default
nice value is 18.

[Field = w]
type = FN
usage = Full path to working directory on remote machines
tooltip = 
manpage = The full path for reaching the current directory on the remote
machines.  This
entry is needed when working on a local disk whose mounted path on the other
machines is different from its path (as given by pwd) on the local machine.

[Field = d]
type = I
usage = Drop a machine after given number of failures in a row (default 5)
tooltip = 
manpage = Drop a machine from the list if it fails this number of times in a
row.  The default criterion is 5.

[Field = e]
type = I
usage = Quit after the given # of processing errors for a chunk (default 5)
tooltip = 
manpage = Quit if a chunk gives a processing error (as opposed to failing to
start) this number of times.  All running jobs will be killed.  The
default limit is 5.

[Field = c]
type = FN
usage = Check the given file for commands P, Q, and D (default 
"processchunks.input")
tooltip = 
manpage = Check the given file periodically for lines with commands to quit,
pause, or drop a machine (Q, P, or D machine_name).  The default name of this
file is "processchunks.input".

[Field = q]
type = I
usage = Run on cluster queue with given maximum # of jobs at once
tooltip = 
manpage = Put chunks on a cluster queue instead of sending them to individual
machines via ssh.  The given value indicates the maximum number of chunks to
submit at any one time.  With this option, the list of machine names must be
replaced by the command needed to interact with the queue.

[Field = Q]
type = CH
usage = Machine name to use for the queue (default queue)
tooltip = 
manpage = When running on a queue, this option can be used to specify the name
that
Processchunks will use when it reports chunks being started and
finishing.  The entry must be a single word with no embedded spaces.  It need
not match the actual name of the queue; the default is "queue".

[Field = P]
type = B
usage = Output process ID
tooltip = 
manpage = Output process ID.  When this option is entered together with "-g",
the program will skip probing machine loads.

[Field = v]
type = B
usage = Verbose output
tooltip = 
manpage =

[Field = V]
type = CH
usage = ?|?,2|class,[function,[...]][,2]|2  Debugging output from specific function.
tooltip = 
manpage = This option enables debugging output from a specific class or
function.  It has no effect if "-v" is not entered too.  The entry has the
form "?|?,2|class,[function,[...]][,2]|2" where 2 means more verbose and ? lists
the functions that have information to print.

[Field = help]
