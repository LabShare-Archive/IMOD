[Field = InputFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input model file with scattered points for 3D gold bead positions
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output file for processed model
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = FlipYandZ]
short = flipyz
type = I
usage = 1 to flip Y and Z coordinates, 0 not to, or -1 to flip if nz > ny
tooltip = 
manpage = This option allows control over whether the Y and Z coordinates of
the model are flipped.  By default, flipping will be done if the Z dimension
(nz) of the modeled volume is greater than the Y dimension (ny).  Enter 1
to force flipping even if this is not the case, or 0 to prevent it if this is
the case.

[Field = SubareaSize]
short = subarea
type = I
usage = Size of subareas over which to analyze for two surfaces
tooltip = 
manpage = Size of subareas over which to analyze for two surfaces.  This is
option is needed only if area coated with beads is large enough and warped
enough that the analysis fails to separate the two surfaces.  The area
occupied by beads will
be divided into non-overlapping subregions of approximately the given size in
each dimension.  Each will be analyzed separately to sort all of the beads
between the two surfaces.  Make this value as large as possible, since the
analysis can easily fail if there are only ~10 beads in any of the subareas.

[Field = XAxisTilt]
short = xtilt
type = F
usage = X axis tilt used to generate the tomogram (for Tiltalign output only)
tooltip = 
manpage = The value of X axis tilt used when the tomogram was generated.  This
value is needed for a 3D fiducial model output by Tiltalign(1) (and only for
such a model), 

[Field = AlreadySorted]
short = already
type = B
usage = Points are already sorted into two surfaces or are on only one surface
tooltip = 
manpage = Use this option to skip the analysis that sorts beads between two
surfaces.  You would use this for a 3D fiducial model from Tiltalign(1) if the
beads are already correctly sorted into two surfaces, or if they are only on
one surface.

[Field = MajorityObjectOnly]
short = majority
type = B
usage = Retain only the points on the surface with more beads
tooltip = 
manpage = Output a model with only one object containing
the points on the surface that has the most beads.  Use this option if 
there are too few fiducials on one surface to fit a smooth surface to in
Flattenwarp(1).


[Field = ChangeSizeInXandY]
short = change
type = IP
usage = X and Y size of reconstruction, adjusted for difference in binning
tooltip = 
manpage = Use this option if the reconstruction is based on a final aligned
stack whose unbinned size is smaller or larger than that of the raw stack, and
if you are processing a 3D fiducial model from Tiltalign(1).  The dimensions
must be adjusted if necessary to match the binning of the prealigned stack on
which that model was based.  Specifically, take the unbinned size of the full
aligned stack divided by the binning of prealigned stack.


[Field = usage]
short = help
long = usage
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage = Print help output.
