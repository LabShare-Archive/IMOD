[Field = reference] 
comment = reference:
^  * If it is a string it should specify the name of an MRC file containing the reference 		
^    volume.
^  * If it is [i  j]. It specifies the reference to be the jth particle of the ith tomogram.

[Field = relativeOrient]
comment = relativeOrient:
^Specify the slicer angles in degrees needed to rotate particles in each
^tomogram to the reference orientation.  For the first iteration, those angles
^are combined with a particle's angles in the motive list to determine the
^rotation needed to align the particle with the reference.  It is only applied
^before the first iteration.

[Field = particlePerCPU]
comment = particlePerCPU:
^Specify how to distribute workload among all CPUs.  # of particles per CPU for
^each run.

[Field = fnVolume]
comment = fnVolume:  The file names of tomograms.

[Field = fnModParticle]
comment = fnModParticle:
^The file names of IMOD models corresponding to each tomogram.

[Field = initMOTL]
comment = initMOTL:
^A code specifying how to construct the initial motive list:
^  0: Set all rotational values to zero
^
^  1: Use the particle model and reference index to initialize phi (rotation
^     around the z axis), be sure the points are sorted along a direction of
^     interest.
^
^  2: Use the particle model and reference index to initialize phi and theta
^     (rotation around the z axis and x axis).
^Or a string array to specify the filenames to load, must end in 1.em

[Field = szVol]
comment = szVol:  The size of the volume around each particle to average.

[Field = fnOutput]
comment = fnOutput:
^The base name of the output files for the average volumes, the reference
^volumes, and the transformation parameters.

[Field = dPhi]
comment = dPhi, dTheta, dPsi:
^The euler angle search space for each iteration for all tomograms, Phi is
^around the Z-axis, Theta is around the X-axis, and Psi is around the Z-axis
^again.

[Field = dTheta]

[Field = dPsi]

[Field = searchRadius]
comment = searchRadius:  The number of pixels to search in each dimension.

[Field = lowCutoff]
KeyValueDelimiter = ==
comment == lowCutoff, hiCutoff:
^The frequency domain cutoff parameters for prefiltering the particles and
^reference lowCutoff =< 0 prevents low frequency filtering, hiCutoff >= 0.866
^prevents high frequency filtering.  An optional second parameter defines the
^transition width.
KeyValueDelimiter == =

[Field = hiCutoff]

[Field = CCMode]
comment = CCMode:
^The cross correlation measure to use:
^  0: Local energy normalized cross correlation (default)
^  1: True local correlation coefficient

[Field = refThreshold]
comment = refThreshold:
^The threshold to generate the reference particle at each stage.  If this is
^less than 1 it specifies a cross correlation coefficient threshold, if it is
^greater than 1 it specfies the number of particles to use.

[Field = refFlagAllTom]

[Field = tiltRange]
comment = tiltRange:
^The tilt range used to acquire the tilt series [min max].  This will
^compenstate  for the missing wedge in generating the alignment and the
^averages.  A empty array, [], specifies not to account for the missing wedge
^(and use more efficient space domain averaging).

[Field = edgeShift]
comment = edgeShift:
^The number of pixels shift the edge of the wedge mask to ensure that all of the
^frequency info is included.

[Field = lstThresholds]
comment = lstThresholds:
^The list of thresholds to use for computing the final volumes.  An average
^volume is generated for each value in this vector.  The format of the average
^volume file name is fnOutout_AvgVol_navg_thresh_iteration.mrc.

[Field = lstFlagAllTom]
comment = meanFill:
^If any particles are partially out of the volume fill with the mean of the
^existant data (default: 0).

[Field = alignedBaseName]
comment = alignedBaseName:
^The basename for the aligned particle MRC files (default: '').

[Field = debugLevel]
comment = debugLevel:  How much debugging info to print {0|1|2|3}.
