[Field = reference]

^the reference volume.  If it is [i  j]. It specifies the reference to be the
^jth particle of the ith tomogram.

[Field = yaxisType]
comment = 0: use original Y axis as the twisting yaxis
^1: use particle model points to determine the twisting yaxis; It is computed
^   point to point.
^2: end points of the contour specified by the "yaxisContour" parameter.

enum.1.tooltip = use particle model points to determine the twisting yaxis; It
is computed point to point.

^Y axis.
^format: [modelNumber objectNumber contourNumber]

[Field = relativeOrient]
comment = Specify the slicer angles in degrees needed to rotate particles in
^each tomogram to the reference orientation.  For the first iteration, those
^angles are combined with a particle's angles in the motive list to determine
^the rotation needed to align the particle with the reference.  It is only
^applied before the first iteration.

[Field = particlePerCPU]
comment = Specify how to distribute workload among all CPUs.  # of particles per
^CPU for each run.

[Field = fnVolume]
comment = The file names of tomograms

[Field = fnModParticle]
comment = 
^The file names of IMOD models corresponding to each tomogram.

[Field = initMOTL]
comment = A code specifying how to construct the initial motive list:
^  0: Set all rotational values to zero
^
^  1: Use the particle model and reference index to
^     initialize phi (rotation around the z axis), be sure
^     the points are sorted along a direction of interest
^
^  2: Use the particle model and reference index to initialize
^     phi and theta (rotation around the z axis and x axis)
^
^     or a string array to specify the filenames to load, must end in 1.em
tooltip = A code specifying how to construct the initial motive list
or a string array to specify the filenames to load, must end in 1.em
enum.0.tooltip = Set all rotational values to zero
enum.1.tooltip = Use the particle model and reference index to initialize phi
(rotation around the z axis), be sure the points are sorted along a direction of
interest
enum.2.tooltip = Use the particle model and reference index to initialize phi
and theta (rotation around the z axis and x axis)

[Field = szVol]
comment = The size of the volume around each particle to average
^if reference is filename, this parameter is ignored. the reference size
^dictates "szVol".

[Field = fnOutput]
comment = The base name of the output files for the average volumes, the
^reference volumes, and the transformation parameters

[Field = dPhi]
comment = Phi is the rotation around the  Y-axis specified above by the parameter "yaxis".
^From this Y-axis, the corresponding X-axis and Z-axis are deduced.

[Field = dTheta]
comment = Theta is around the corresponding Z-axis. dTheta is the increment.

[Field = dPsi]
comment = Psi is around the corresponding X-axis. dPsi is the increment.

[Field = searchRadius]
KeyValueDelimiter = ==
comment == The number of pixels to search in each dimension
^searchRadius={4, 5} is equivalent to searchRadius={[4 4 4],[5 5 5]}
KeyValueDelimiter == =

[Field = lowCutoff]
KeyValueDelimiter = ==
comment == The frequency domain cutoff parameters for prefiltering the
^particles and reference.  LowCutoff =< 0 prevents low frequency
^filtering.  An optional second parameter defines the transition width.
KeyValueDelimiter == =

[Field = hiCutoff]
KeyValueDelimiter = ==
comment = The frequency domain cutoff parameters for prefiltering the
^particles and reference.  HiCutoff >= 0.866 prevents high frequency filtering.
^An optional second parameter defines the transition width.
KeyValueDelimiter == =

[Field = CCMode]
comment = The cross correlation measure to use.
^  0: Local energy normalized cross correlation (default)
^  1: True local correlation coefficient
tooltip = The cross correlation measure to use.
enum.0.tooltip = Local energy normalized cross correlation (default)
enum.1.tooltip = True local correlation coefficient

[Field = refThreshold]
comment = The threshold to generate the reference particle at each stage
^If this is less than 1 it specifies a cross correlation
^coefficient threshold, if it is greater than 1 it specfies the
^number of particles to use

[Field = refFlagAllTom]

[Field = tiltRange]
comment = The tilt range used to acquire the tilt series [min max].
^This will compenstate  for the missing wedge in generating
^the alignment and the averages.  A empty array, [], specifies
^not to account for the missing wedge (and use more efficient
^space domain averaging).

[Field = edgeShift]
comment = The number of pixels shift the edge of the wedge mask to ensure
^that all of the frequency info is included.

[Field = flgWedgeWeight]
comment = Apply missing wedge compensation to the alignment search
