[Field = reference] 
comment = reference
^  * If it is a string it should specify the name of an MRC file containing the reference
^    volume.
^  * If it is [i  j]. It specifies the reference to be the jth particle of the ith tomogram.

[Field = yaxisType]
comment = yaxisType
^0: use original Y axis as the twisting yaxis;
^1: use particle model points to determine the twisting yaxis; It is computed point to point.
^2: end points of the contour specified by the "yaxisContour" parameter.

[Field = yaxisContour]
comment = yaxisContour
^specify the contour of a model  whose points are used to determine the Y axis.
^format: [modelNumber objectNumber contourNumber]

[Field = relativeOrient]
comment = relativeOrient
^Specify the slicer angles in degrees needed to rotate particles in each tomogram to the
^reference orientation.  For the first iteration, those angles are combined with a particle's
^angles in the motive list to determine the rotation needed to align the particle with the
^reference.  It is only applied before the first iteration.

[Field = particlePerCPU]
comment = particlePerCPU
^Specify how to distribute workload among all CPUs.  # of particles per CPU for each
^run.

[Field = fnVolume]
comment = fnVolume
^The file names of tomograms

[Field = fnModParticle]
comment = fnModParticle
^The file names of IMOD models corresponding to each tomogram.

[Field = initMOTL]
comment = initMOTL: A code specifying how to construct the initial motive list:
^  0: Set all rotational values to zero
^
^  1: Use the particle model and reference index to
^     initialize phi (rotation around the z axis), be sure
^     the points are sorted along a direction of interest
^
^  2: Use the particle model and reference index to initialize
^     phi and theta (rotation around the z axis and x axis)
^
^     or a string array to specify the filenames to load, must end in 1.em

[Field = szVol]
comment = szVol: The size of the volume around each particle to average
^if reference is filename, this parameter is ignored. the reference size dictates "szVol".

[Field = fnOutput]
comment = fnOutput: The base name of the output files for the average volumes, the
^reference volumes, and the transformation parameters

[Field = dPhi]
comment = dPhi dTheta dPsi:
^Phi is the rotation around the  Y-axis specified above by the parameter "yaxis".
^From this Y-axis, the corresponding X-axis and Z-axis are deduced.
^Theta is around the corresponding Z-axis. dTheta is the increment.
^Psi is around the corresponding X-axis. dPsi is the increment.

[Field = dTheta]

[Field = dPsi]

[Field = searchRadius]
KeyValueDelimiter = ==
comment == searchRadius: The number of pixels to search in each dimension
^searchRadius={4, 5} is equivalent to searchRadius={[4 4 4],[5 5 5]}
KeyValueDelimiter == =

[Field = lowCutoff]
KeyValueDelimiter = ==
comment == lowCutoff hiCutoff: The frequency domain cutoff parameters for prefiltering the
^particles and reference lowCutoff =< 0 prevents low frequency
^filtering, hiCutoff >= 0.866 prevents high frequency filtering.
^An optional second parameter defines the transition width.
KeyValueDelimiter == =

[Field = hiCutoff]

[Field = CCMode]
comment = CCMode:    The cross correlation measure to use.
^  0: Local energy normalized cross correlation (default)
^  1: True local correlation coefficient

[Field = refThreshold]
comment = refThreshold: The threshold to generate the reference particle at each stage
^If this is less than 1 it specifies a cross correlation
^coefficient threshold, if it is greater than 1 it specfies the
^number of particles to use

[Field = refFlagAllTom]

[Field = tiltRange]
comment = tiltRange:  The tilt range used to acquire the tilt series [min max].
^This will compenstate  for the missing wedge in generating
^the alignment and the averages.  A empty array, [], specifies
^not to account for the missing wedge (and use more efficient
^space domain averaging).

[Field = edgeShift]
comment = edgeShift:  The number of pixels shift the edge of the wedge mask to ensure
^that all of the frequency info is included.

[Field = flgWedgeWeight]
comment = flgWedgeWeight:  Apply missing wedge compensation to the alignment search

[Field = lstThresholds]
comment = lstThresholds: The list of thresholds to use for computing the final volumes.
^An average volume is generated for each value in this vector.
^The format of the average volume file name is
^fnOutout_AvgVol_navg_thresh_iteration.mrc

[Field = lstFlagAllTom]

[Field = meanFill]
comment = meanFill: If any particles are partially out of the volume fill with the
^mean of the existant data (default: 0).


[Field = alignedBaseName]
comment = alignedBaseName: The basename for the aligned particle MRC files (default: '').


[Field = debugLevel]
comment = debugLevel:  How much debugging info to print {0|1|2|3}
