[Field = InfoFile]
short = info
type = FN
usage = Name of supermontage info file
tooltip =
manpage = Name of a supermontage info file in which all data about files
is be stored.  It will be read in when the program
starts, and renamed to filename~ before writing a new version when the program
exits.  If this option is not entered, the first non-option argument will be
taken as the name of the info file.

short = xrun
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending frame number in X for patch files to analyze
tooltip =

usage = Starting and ending frame number in Y for patch files to analyze

[Field = TargetMeanResidual]
short = target
type = FA
usage = Target mean residuals to achieve in Findwarp (default 
0.3,0.5,0.75,1.,1.25,1.5)
tooltip = 
manpage = One or more mean residual values to try to reach when Findwarp(1)
searches for the best warping.  Multiple values should be entered in increasing
order.  Findwarp(1) will try to find a warping with the largest number of
included patches that gives a mean residual below the first value; then it
tries again with the second value, etc.  The default values are designed to 
produce a successful fit even with rather bad patches.

[Field = ClippingPlaneBoxSize]
short = clip
type = I
usage = Size of square area enclosed by 4 clipping planes (default 600)
tooltip =
manpage = Four clipping planes will be added to the reduced and residual models
to allow a small square of the patch vector model to be viewed in isolation.
Use this option to change the size from the default of 600 pixels.

[Field = ScaleFactor]
short = scale
type = F
usage = Factor for scaling vectors in reduced and residual models (default 10)
tooltip =
manpage = Factor for scaling vectors in reduced and residual models.  The
default is 10, is is used for vectors when combining tomograms.  Note that the
original vectors are always scaled by 5 in Edgepatches(1) because they tend to
be so long.

[Field = RescaleModels]
short = rescale
type = B
usage = Remake the reduced and residual models with the current scale factor.
