[Field = InfoFile]
short = info
type = FN
usage = Name of supermontage information file
tooltip =
manpage = Name of autodoc-type file with information about the supermontage.
If this option is not entered, the first non-option argument will be taken as
the name of the info file.

[Field = ZvaluesToDo]
short = zvalues
type = LI
usage = List of Z values to analyze
tooltip =
manpage = List of Z values at which to run the analysis (comma-separated
ranges allowed).  The default is to do all Z values.

[Field = RotationInXYplane]
short = rotation
type = F
usage = Angle to rotate in X/Y plane
tooltip =
manpage = Angle to rotate all volumes in the X/Y plane.  If this option is not
entered, the program will find the angle that brings the centers of the
aligned volumes onto a rectangular grid.  Enter an angle or zero to override
this behavior.

[Field = SizeOfOutputFramesXandY]
short = size
type = IP
usage = Size in X and Y of transformed files to be created by Warpvol
tooltip =
manpage = Size in X and Y of transformed files to be created by Matchvol or
Warpvol.  The default is the size of the largest input volume.

[Field = FindMagnification]
short = mag
type = B
usage = Find overall magnification factors
tooltip =
manpage =

[Field = FindStretch]
short = stretch
type = B
usage = Find in-plane stretch parameters
tooltip =
manpage = Find in-plane stretch parameters, which are expressed as size change
and rotation of the Y axis relative to the X axis.

[Field = FindThinning]
short = thinning
type = B
usage = Find thinning factors
tooltip =
manpage = Find thinning factors, factors by which to change the thickness of
the volumes.

[Field = FindAngles]
short = angles
type = IT
usage = Values indicating whether to find rotations around X, Y, and Z
tooltip =
manpage = Values or 1 or 0 indicating whether to find rotations around X, Y,
and Z, respectively.  The default is 1,1,1, so this option would be used to
turn off solutions for some angles.

[Field = MetroFactor]
short = metro
type = F
usage = Initial step size in minimization; default 0.24
tooltip =
manpage = Initial step size or "metro factor" in the minimization procedure;
the default is 0.24.  Vary this value slightly if a minimization fails.

[Field = XRunStartEnd]
short = xrun
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending volumes in X to analyze
tooltip =
manpage = Starting and ending volumes in X to analyze, numbered from 1.  The
default is to do all volumes in X.

[Field = YRunStartEnd]
short = yrun
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending volumes in Y to analyze
tooltip =
manpage = Starting and ending volumes in Y to analyze, numbered from 1.  The
default is to do all volumes in Y.

[Field = VectorSpacingFactor]
short = spacing
type = F
usage = Factor by which to change spacing of vectors for warping fields
tooltip =
manpage = This factor makes the spacing of the vectors put out in the
warping fields for each volume be less than the spacing of the patch vectors
measured in the overlap zones.  The default is 0.7, which makes the density
of warping vectors be about three times higher than the density of the patch
vectors.

[Field = AllTogether]
short = all
type = B
usage = Analyze all volumes in a single minimization procedure
tooltip =
manpage = Analyze all volumes in a single minimization procedure.  The default
is to get a solution for each pair of overlapping volumes and resolve the
results into a single solution.  When parameters are searched for all volumes
together, the results are poor, probably due to multiple minima.

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
long = ParameterFile
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.

[Field = usage]
short = help
long = usage
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage =
