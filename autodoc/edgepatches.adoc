[Field = InfoFile]
short = info
type = FN
usage = Name of supermontage info file to be created or edited
tooltip =
manpage = Name of a supermontage info file in which all data about the files
will be stored.  If the file exists, it will be read in when the program
starts, and renamed to filename~ before writing a new version when the program
exits.  If this option is not entered, the first non-option argument will be
taken as the name of the info file.

[Field = NoZValues]
short = noz
type = B
usage = Search for and create names without Z values
tooltip =
manpage = Search for and create names without Z values and assume the Z value
is zero.  This option cannot be used when adding a supermontage to an existing
one, or when specifying a z range with -zadd.

[Field = RootName]
short = root
type = CH
usage = Rootname for existing files and ones to be created
tooltip =

Existing files need not be named according to the conventions if they are
already listed in the info file.

[Field = OverlapInXandY]
short = overlap
type = IP
usage = Nominal overlap between adjacent volumes in X and Y
tooltip =
manpage = Nominal overlap between adjacent volumes in X and Y.  This only
needs to be a rough approximation.  This entry is required when adding a
supermontage or the first time a manually prepared info file is read.

[Field = UnderscoreXYZ]
short = underscore
type = B
usage = Use underscores between x, y, and z in composing names
tooltip =
manpage = Use underscores between x, y, and z in composing names for files
being searched for and created.

[Field = ExtensionOnVolumes]
short = ext
type = CH
usage = Extension on filenames when searching for volumes (default .rec)
tooltip =
manpage = Extension on filenames when searching for volumes, including the
period.  There may be characters before the true extension, such as if all
files are named "binned.rec".  The default is .rec.

[Field = AddMontageXandY]
short = xyadd
type = IP
usage = Add a supermontage with the given number of frames in X and Y
tooltip =
manpage = Add a supermontage with the given number of frames in X and Y.  The
program will search for pieces by rootname and frame number in X and Y, with 
numbers starting from 1.

[Field = AddMontageXRange]
short = xadd
type = IP
usage = Add a supermontage with given starting and ending frame numbers in X 
tooltip =
manpage = Starting and ending X values to search for when adding a
supermontage.  Use this option and -yadd if the starting frame number is not 1
in X or in Y.  If one of the two options -xadd and -yadd is entered, then the
other must be entered as well, and -xyadd must not be entered.

[Field = AddMontageYRange]
short = yadd
type = IP
usage = Add a supermontage with given starting and ending frame numbers in Y 
tooltip =
manpage = Starting and ending Y values to search for when adding a
supermontage.

[Field = AddMontageZRange]
short = zadd
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending Z values to search for when adding a supermontage
tooltip =
manpage = Starting and ending Z values to search for when adding a
supermontage.  If this option is entered, then either -xyadd, or -xadd and
-yadd, must be entered.

[Field = DefaultRegionModel]
short = model
type = FN
usage = Patch region model to use for an overlap zone if one is not found
tooltip =
manpage = Patch region model to use for an overlap zone if one is not found
when initially setting up the Edge entries in the info file.  This option will
have an effect only when adding a supermontage or processing a manually
prepared info file for the first time.

[Field = RunAll]
short = all
type = B
usage = Analyze overlap zones for all frames
tooltip =
manpage = Analyze overlap zones for all frames.  No analysis will be done
unless this option or one or more of -xrun, -yrun, or -zrun are entered.

[Field = XRunStartEnd]
short = xrun
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending frame number in X for overlap zones to analyze
tooltip =
manpage =

[Field = YRunStartEnd]
short = yrun
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending frame number in Y for overlap zones to analyze
tooltip =
manpage =

[Field = ZRunStartEnd]
short = zrun
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending Z value for overlap zones to analyze
tooltip =
manpage =

[Field = SkipDone]
short = skip
type = B
usage = Skip any overlap zones that were already analyzed
tooltip =
manpage = Skip any overlap zones that were already analyzed.  The default is
to use any shifts that were found previously but to rerun patch correlations.

[Field = RedoShifts]
short = redo
type = B
usage = Recompute the shifts between frames if already done
tooltip =
manpage = Recompute the shifts between frames for any that were already done.

[Field = LongFraction]
short = long
type = F
usage = Fraction of long dimension of the overlap zone to use for finding shift
tooltip =
manpage = Fraction of long dimension of the overlap zone to use for 
finding the X/Y shift between the projections of the two pieces.  The default
is 0.5.  When pieces are significantly skewed from each other, rather than
arranged nearly horizontally or vertically, this fraction should be made
higher, such as 1.0.

[Field = PatchSizeXYZ]
short = size
type = IT
usage = Size in X, Y, Z of patches to correlate (default 100,100,50)
tooltip =
manpage = Size in X, Y, and Z of patches to correlate.  The default is 100 x
100 x 50.

[Field = IntervalsShortLongZ]
short = intervals
type = IT
usage = Interval between patches in short, long, and Z dimension (default 
80,120,50)
tooltip =
manpage = Interval between patches in the short, long, and Z dimensions of
overlap zones.  The program will use these intervals to determine how many
patches to specify when running Corrsearch3d(1).  The defaults are 80,120,50.

[Field = ForceNumberInZ]
short = force
type = I
usage = Set the number of patches in Z to the given value
tooltip =
manpage = Set the number of patches in Z to the given value, regardless of
the interval between them.

[Field = BordersInXYandZ]
short = borders
type = IP
usage = Borders in X/Y and in Z for region to do patches in (default 50,10)
tooltip =
manpage = Borders in X/Y and in Z for region in which to do patch
correlations.  These borders are distances from the edge of each image file,
and thus define borders in the overlap zone.  The border is X and Y is
redundant to limiting the region with a patch region model.  The border in Z
is a default value that will be overriden by a Zlimits entry for an individual
piece.  The default is 50,10.

[Field = KernelSigma]
short = kernel
type = F
usage = Sigma in pixels for real-space smoothing with 3D Gaussian kernel
tooltip =
manpage = Sigma for real-space smoothing with 3D Gaussian kernel (in pixels).
Patches will be smoothed before correlating with 3x3x3 kernel (for sigma <
1.5) or a 5x5x5 kernel (sigma not < 1.5) whose coefficients are
proportional to a Gaussian with the given sigma centered on the central
pixel.

[Field = TestMode]
short = test
