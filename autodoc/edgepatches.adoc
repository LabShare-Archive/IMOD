Version = 1.0
Pip = 1

[Field = InfoFile]
short = info
type = FN
usage = Name of supermontage info file
tooltip =
manpage = Name of a supermontage info file in which data about the files
are stored.  The file must exists.  It will be read in when the program
starts, and renamed to filename~ before writing a new version after various operations.
If this option is not entered, the first non-option argument will be
taken as the name of the info file.

[Field = RunAll]
short = all
type = B
usage = Analyze overlap zones for all frames
tooltip =
manpage = Analyze overlap zones for all frames.  No analysis will be done
unless this option or one or more of -xrun, -yrun, or -zrun are entered.

[Field = XRunStartEnd]
short = xrun
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending frame numbers in X for overlap zones to analyze
tooltip =
manpage = Starting and ending frame numbers in X surrounding the overlap zones
to analyze.

[Field = YRunStartEnd]
short = yrun
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending frame number in Y for overlap zones to analyze
tooltip =
manpage = Starting and ending frame numbers in Y surrounding the overlap zones
to analyze.  For example, to analyze one overlap zone between two pieces
adjacent in X, enter the two frame numbers in X for -xrun and the Y frame number
for -yrun, such as "-xrun 2,3 -yrun 2,2".

[Field = ZRunStartEnd]
short = zrun
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending Z value for overlap zones to analyze
tooltip =
manpage =

[Field = SkipDone]
short = skip
type = B
usage = Skip any overlap zones that were already analyzed
tooltip =
manpage = Skip any overlap zones that were already analyzed.  The default is
to use any shifts that were found previously but to rerun patch correlations.

[Field = RedoShifts]
short = redo
type = B
usage = Recompute the shifts between frames if already done
tooltip =
manpage = Recompute the shifts between frames for any that were already done.

[Field = UseProjXformFile]
short = use
type = B
usage = Recompute 3D shifts starting with the 2D shifts in the .projxf files
tooltip =
manpage = Redo the 3D cross-correlations in the center of the overlap zones,
taking the initial shifts from existing ".projxf" for each overlap zone
instead of redoing projections and 2D correlations.  Use this option after
fixing the initial shift with Midas(1).  This option implies the "-redo"
option.

[Field = IgnoreLastShifts]
short = ignore
type = B
usage = Use original overlap values as starting shifts for 2D correlations
tooltip =
manpage = Use original overlap values as the basis for the starting shifts
when redoing 2D correlations.  By default, the program uses the current
shift from the info file to determine what areas to project and correlate in
an overlap zone, so that one can edit a correct value into the file.  Use this
option to make it ignore previous, incorrect values of the shift, such as if
you need to rerun the correlations with a different long fraction value.

[Field = LongFraction]
short = long
type = F
usage = Fraction of long dimension of the overlap zone to use for finding shift
tooltip =
manpage = Fraction of long dimension of the overlap zone to use for 
finding the X/Y shift between the projections of the two pieces.  The default
is 0.5.  When pieces are significantly skewed from each other, rather than
arranged nearly horizontally or vertically, this fraction should be made
higher, such as 1.0.

[Field = OverlapToAssume]
short = overlap
type = I
usage = Number of pixels of overlap to assume when finding initial shifts
tooltip =
manpage = Number of pixels of overlap to assume when finding initial shifts
with correlations of 3D projections.  The nominal overlap determines how wide
an area is projected for correlating; this entry overrides the overlap entered
with Setupstitch.

[Field = PatchSizeXYZ]
short = size
type = IT
usage = Size in X, Y, Z of patches to correlate (default 100,100,50)
tooltip =
manpage = Size in X, Y, and Z of patches to correlate.  The default is 100 x
100 x 50.

[Field = IntervalsShortLongZ]
short = intervals
type = IT
usage = Interval between patches in short, long, and Z dimension (default 
80,120,50)
tooltip =
manpage = Interval between patches in the short, long, and Z dimensions of
overlap zones.  The program will use these intervals to determine how many
patches to specify when running Corrsearch3d(1).  The defaults are 80,120,50.

[Field = ForceNumberInZ]
short = force
type = I
usage = Set the number of patches in Z to the given value
tooltip =
manpage = Set the number of patches in Z to the given value, regardless of
the interval between them.

[Field = BordersInXYandZ]
short = borders
type = IP
usage = Borders in X/Y and in Z for region to do patches in (default 50,10)
tooltip =
manpage = Borders in X/Y and in Z for region in which to do patch
correlations.  These borders are distances from the edge of each image file,
and thus define borders in the overlap zone.  The border is X and Y is
redundant to limiting the region with a patch region model.  The border in Z
is a default value that will be overriden by a Zlimits entry for an individual
piece.  The default is 50,10.

[Field = KernelSigma]
short = kernel
type = F
usage = Sigma in pixels for real-space smoothing with 3D Gaussian kernel
tooltip =
manpage = Sigma for real-space smoothing with 3D Gaussian kernel (in pixels).
Patches will be smoothed before correlating with 3x3x3 kernel (for sigma <
1.5) or a 5x5x5 kernel (sigma not < 1.5) whose coefficients are
proportional to a Gaussian with the given sigma centered on the central
pixel.

[Field = TestMode]
short = test
type = I
usage = Sum of 1 for verbose output and 2 to leave temporary files
tooltip =
manpage =
