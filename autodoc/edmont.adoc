[Field = ImageInputFile]
short = imin
type = FNM
usage = Montaged image input file
tooltip =
manpage = Montaged image input file.  If there is more than one non-option
argument, all except the last one are also taken as image input files,
following any files entered with this option.

[Field = PieceListInput]
short = plin
type = FNM
usage = File with list of piece coordinates for image input file
tooltip =
manpage = File with list of piece coordinates for image input file.  This file
may be omitted if the image file has piece coordinates in its header, but if
this entry is made for any image file, there must be an entry for each image
file.  However, a filename of "none" can be entered if some image files have
coordinates in the header and some do not.

[Field = ImageOutputFile]
short = imout
type = FNM
usage = Output file for montaged images
tooltip =
manpage = Output file for montaged images.  If there are any non-option
arguments, the last one is also taken as an output image file, following any
filenames entered with this option.

[Field = PieceListOutput]
short = plout
type = FNM
usage = File for list of coordinates of pieces in output image file
tooltip =
manpage = File for list of coordinates of pieces in output image file.  This
entry may be omitted if the coordinates are being placed in the image header,
but is required if there are input piece list files.

[Field = SectionsToRead]
short = secs
type = LIM
usage = List of sections to read from input file, numbered from 0.  
The default is all sections.  Ranges are allowed.
tooltip = 
manpage = List of sections to read from an input file, numbered from 0.
Ranges may be entered (e.g., 1-3,5,8), and / may be used to specify all
sections in the file.  If multiple lists are entered, each
one will be applied to the respective input file.  If no list is entered for
a file, all sections will be read.  Note that montages can have missing
sections, and a list that includes such missing sections will generate an
error.

[Field = NumberToOutput]
short = numout
type = IAM
usage = Number of sections to write to each output file
tooltip = 
manpage = Number of sections to write to each output file, when there are
multiple output files.  These numbers may be listed in sequence in one entry,
or in several entries.  If there is one output file per section being written,
then one section will be written to each file and this entry is not needed.

[Field = ModeToOutput]
short = mode
type = I
usage = Storage mode of output file; 0 for byte, 1 or 6 for integer, 2 for real
tooltip = 
manpage = The storage mode of the output file; 0 for byte, 1 for 16-bit 
signed integer, 6 for 16-bit unsigned integer, or 2 for 32-bit floating point.
The default is the mode of the first input file.

[Field = XMinAndMax]
short = xminmax
type = IP
usage = Minimum and maximum X coordinates to include in output
tooltip = 
manpage = Minimum and maximum X coordinates to include in output.  Any piece
containing pixels within this range will be included in the output.  Thus, you
need to pick coordinates that are far enough away from the edges of a piece
to exclude overlapping pieces that you do not want.

[Field = YMinAndMax]
short = yminmax
type = IP
usage = Minimum and maximum Y coordinates to include in output
tooltip = 
manpage = Minimum and maximum Y coordinates to include in output.  Any piece
containing pixels within this range will be included in the output.

[Field = XFrameMinAndMax]
short = xframes
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending frames in X to include in output (numbered from 1)
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending frames in X to include in the output.  Frames are
numbered from one for the leftmost frame in any of the input files, up to the
rightmost frame in any of the input files.

[Field = YFrameMinAndMax]
short = yframes
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending frames in Y to include in output (numbered from 1)
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending frames in Y to include in the output.  Frames
are numbered from 1 for the bottommost frame of any input file, up to the
topmost frame in any input file.

[Field = FloatDensities]
short = float
type = I
usage = Rescale densities of sections separately to fill data range (1) or to 
bring to common mean and SD (2), or together to fill data range (-1)
tooltip = 
manpage = Adjust densities of sections individually or together.  Enter 1 for
each section to fill the data range, 2 to scale sections to common mean and
standard deviation, or -1 to scale all sections by the same factors to fill
the data range.  The latter scaling occurs only when changing from one fixed
point mode (0, 1, or 6) to another.  It is most useful when converting from an
integer to a byte mode, because otherwise the data will fill only the fraction
of the byte range that they occupy in the integer range.

[Field = BinByFactor]
short = bin
type = I
usage = Use binning to reduce images in size by the given factor
tooltip =
manpage = Use binning to reduce images in size by the given factor.  Because
coordinates are kept as integers, binning may not produce exactly the same
spacing between pieces as in the original data.  This is not a problem if the
data are still to be blended, since Blendmont(1) can adjust for any
shifts induced by the binning.  However, if data are already blended, the
pieces will not be precisely aligned unless both the original image size and
overlap are evenly divisible by the the binning.  Use Reducemont(1) for
binning if this is not the case.

[Field = ExclusionModel]
short = exclude
type = FN
usage = Model file with points on pieces to exclude from output
tooltip =
manpage = Model file with points on pieces to exclude from output.  This
option allows you to remove bad pieces from a montage.  To make a model,
set the object type to scattered points and turn on a symbol display so that
you can see the points.  Place points near the middle of the unwanted pieces. 
A point must be in the region outside the overlap zones, if overlap is less
that one quarter of the piece size, or within the central half of the piece if
overlap is higher than that.  If overlap is high, you will have to anticipate
where the entire piece is located in the 3dmod display, since pieces are
generally overlaid on two sides by overlapping pieces that occur later in the
image file.  All points in the model will be used as exclusion points.

[Field = RenumberZFromZero]
short = renumber
type = B
usage = Renumber Z values to be sequential and start at zero
tooltip = 
manpage = Renumber Z values to be sequential and start at zero.  This option
can be used to close up gaps from missing sections or to shift the Z values
of a subset stack down to start at zero.  It is required if you are combining
two montages that have pieces at the same coordinates.

[Field = ShiftXYToZero]
short = shift
type = B
usage = Adjust X and Y piece coordinates to start at zero
tooltip = 
manpage = Adjust X and Y piece coordinates to start at zero.  If the data are
going into multiple output files, the coordinates of the entire collection of
output sections will start at zero, but the coordinates in any one file may
not start at zero.  To achieve other shifts of piece coordinates, use
Edpiecepoint(1).

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.

[Field = usage]
short = help
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage =
