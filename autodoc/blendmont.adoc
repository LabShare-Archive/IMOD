usage = Value to fill empty image areas with, before scaling
tooltip = 
manpage = Value to fill areas of the output image that have no image data.
The value is used before any scling by the -float option, so it will not work
as intended with -float.

tooltip = 
manpage = Starting X and Y coordinates of file used to align images with
warping.  If warping transforms are being applied and the image region being
output does not match the region used to align the images, these coordinates

usage = Adjust the image origin for the range of X and Y output
tooltip = 
manpage = Adjust the origin values in the image file header based on the

built on the input stack should be correctly located when loaded onto the
output stack in 3dmod(1).  Model points will be correctly located in Z
provided that a contiguous set of sections is output.  This origin adjustment
is inappropriate if an output piece list is used to read the data into 3dmod.

long = BinByFactor
type = I
usage = Use binning to reduce images in size by the given factor
tooltip = 
manpage = Use binning to reduce images in size by the given factor.  Binning
is applied to the data just before output, so the starting and ending X and Y

usage = File with magnification gradients to be applied for each image
tooltip = 
manpage = File with magnification gradients to be applied for each section.
This should be a file listing the tilt angle, the percent magnification change
per micron of Z height, and the degrees of rotation per micron of Z height

correction is applied before a distortion field correction and is used when
computing edge functions.

usage = Focus was adjusted for changing Z height when montage was acquired
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = AddToGradient]
short = addgrad
type = FP
usage = Add to or set the mag and rotation gradients with the given values
tooltip =
manpage = The magnification gradient correction is specified by
two parameters: % of mag change per micron of Z height, and degrees of
rotation per micron of Z height.  If -gradient has been entered, this option
can be used to increment the values in the gradient file for each section. 
If -gradient has
not been entered, the values entered here will be used for all sections; but in
this case the -geometry option must be entered to provide additional
information, and also -tiltfile if the data are at different tilt angles.

[Field = TiltFile]
short = tiltfile
type = FN
usage = File with tilt angles only (used if no mag gradient file)
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of file with tilt angles, one per line.  These angles will be
used in computing mag gradients, only if there is no
mag gradient file to supply the tilt angles.

[Field = OffsetTilts]
short = offset
type = F
usage = Add given value to tilt angles from gradient or tilt file
tooltip =
manpage = Add the given value to the tilt angles from the gradient file or the
tilt file.
Sometimes the gradient that gives the lowest error in registering the pieces
will differ between the positive and negative side of the tilt series.  This
entry can be used to give a better overall error reduction.

[Field = TiltGeometry]
short = geometry
type = FT
usage = Specify pixel size, tilt axis rotation angle, and tilt angle
tooltip =
manpage = When magnification gradients are being corrected for, this entry 
can be used in place of a gradient file to specify the 
pixel size in nanometers, tilt axis rotation angle, and tilt angle to be used
for the gradient computation.  The entry has no effect if a gradient file is
provided.

[Field = JustUndistort]
short = justUndistort
type = B
usage = Just correct distortions in each frame without blending
tooltip =
manpage = With this entry, the program can be used just to correct for 
magnification gradients and distortion fields, without computing edge functions
or blending images.  The resulting images are the same as those used to 
compute edge functions, and will be suitable for fixing edge functions in 
Midas.  Either -distort or -gradient must be entered with this option.  The
sections to do may be specified, but all entries with regard to frame and total
sizes in X and Y and edge functions will be ignored.

[Field = TestMode]
short = test
type = B
usage = Compute overlap errors only
tooltip =
manpage = This entry runs the program in a special mode in which it will 
compute edge functions and find the best shifts of the pieces for a given

although an empty output file will be produced.

[SectionHeader = ShiftOptions]

pieces in overlap zones and the shifting of pieces into best alignment.

[Field = SloppyMontage]
short = sloppy
type = B
usage = Do initial cross-correlations for finding edge functions
tooltip = 
manpage = Do initial cross-correlations for finding edge functions and shift
pieces to minimize displacements in the overlap zones

[Field = VerySloppyMontage]
short = very
type = B
usage = Do correlations with parameters for finding very big displacements
tooltip = 
manpage = This option acts like SloppyMontage and also sets several parameters
for dealing with very sloppy montages with displacements potentially bigger
than half the width of the overlap zones.  The aspect ratio of the area used
for correlating the overlap zones is increased from 2 to 5 and the filter
parameter radius1 is set to -0.01 to eliminate more low frequencies from the
correlation.  The area being correlated is made wider by setting the extra
width fraction to 0.25.  Up to 16 peaks in the correlation are evaluated by
cross-correlation coefficient.  If distortion corrections are being done, the
default is changed to taper instead of trimming out fill areas for
correlation.

[Field = ShiftPieces]
short = shift
type = B
usage = Shift pieces to minimize displacements in the overlap zones
tooltip = 
manpage = Shift pieces to minimize displacements in the overlap zones.  The
default is to use information from edge functions and from cross-correlations
for each section and pick the one that gives lowest error.

[Field = ShiftFromEdges]
short = edge
type = B
usage = Use only edge functions for shifting pieces
tooltip = 
manpage = Use only edge functions for shifting pieces.

[Field = ShiftFromXcorrs]
short = xcorr
type = B
usage = Use only cross-correlations of overlap zones for shifting pieces 
(legacy behavior)
tooltip = 
manpage = Use only cross-correlations of overlap zones for shifting pieces 
(legacy behavior).

[Field = ReadInXcorrs]

manpage = Read displacements in the overlap zones from an existing .ecd file
instead of computing correlations.

[Field = BinningForEdgeShifts]

type = F
usage = Relative binning of images when edge displacements were first computed
tooltip =
manpage = The binning of the images used to determine the edge displacements 
being read in, relative to the current binning of the images, if any. 
You can used binned images to determine edge displacements and
fix them in Midas(1), then use those displacements directly with unbinned
images by specifying the original binning with this option.

[Field = OverlapForEdgeShifts]
short = overlap
type = IP
usage = Overlap in X and Y when edge displacements were first computed
tooltip =
manpage = This option allows you to change the overlap between pieces and use
edge displacements determined with the original overlaps.  Bad artifacts can
occur when the difference between the actual average overlap between pieces
and the overlap in the piece list is big enough to change the actual
coordinates of pieces by more than twice the piece size.  The program will
detect this situation and issue a warning advising that you change the
overlap.  You can use Edpiecepoint(1) to get a new piece list with a different
overlap in one or both dimensions.  Set the new overlap to the old overlap
minus the average edge displacement reported in the warning.  If you want to
use existing edge displacements rather than starting from scratch, use this
option to specify the overlaps in the run originally used to compute edge
displacements.  If that run was done with binned images, enter the binned
overlap value.

[Field = SkipEdgeModelFile]
short = skip
type = FN
usage = Model file with points near edges to exclude
tooltip = 
manpage = Model file with points near edges to exclude when computing edge 
functions and displacements.  You can exclude edges where the overlap cannot
be determined correctly in order to prevent bad displacements from affecting
the placement of surrounding pieces.  On an initial run of Blendmont, marked
edges will be given zero correlation displacements and zero edge functions.
On subsequent runs, the treatment of such edges may be affected by the
-nonzero option described next.  If an edge is marked in a model file, 
it will be excluded even if it is not marked as excluded in the edge 
displacement file that was read in.

[Field = NonzeroSkippedEdgeUse]
short = nonzero
type = I
usage = Where to use excluded edges that have non-zero shifts read from file
tooltip = 
manpage = An indicator of how to treat excluded edges that have non-zero shifts
read in from the edge displacement file.  Possible values are: 0, to exclude
the edge from computation of piece shifts and to give it a zero edge function;
1, to include the displacement in the computation of piece shifts but still
give the edge a zero edge function; 2, to include the displacement in the
computation of piece shifts and compute an edge function for it.  The default
is 0.

[Field = RobustFitCriterion]
short = robust
type = F
usage = Criterion for ignoring aberrant edge shifts when finding piece shifts
tooltip =
manpage = When solving for the piece shifts from the displacements between
pieces, the program can give less weight to, or completely ignore,
displacements that appear to be outliers.  This option activates this
robust fitting and specifies the criterion for determining an outlier.  A
value of 1 will generally find nearly all outliers but may downweight some edge
displacements inappropriately and give a poor blend across those edges.
Higher values, up to about 1.5, will avoid the latter problem but will tend
not to catch actual outliers.  This option is ideal for getting a higher
quality blend quickly for a low-magnification map where grid bars ruin some of
the displacements.  For data to be analyzed, it is preferable to fix the bad
displacements or mark edges to be excluded in Midas(1).
Robust fitting is available only with more than 10 pieces.

manpage = Width in X and Y across which to blend overlaps.  The default is:
^  80% of the overlap zone width for overlap width less than 63,

^  50% of the overlap width for overlap width greater than 100.

[Field = BoxSizeShortAndLong]
short = boxsize
type = IP
usage = Size of box for finding edge functions in short and long directions
tooltip = 
manpage = Size of box for finding edge functions in short and long directions.
The short direction is across an overlap zone, the long direction is along it.
The default size is 10 pixels in the short direction for frame sizes up to 
512 pixels, increasing proportional to the maximum dimension of the frame 
above 512 and up to a value of 80.  (For this and the next two options, there
is no increase in the default above a frame size of 4096.)  The default in the
long direction is 1.5 times the size in the short direction.

[Field = GridSpacingShortAndLong]
short = grid
type = IP
usage = Spacing of edge function grid in short and long directions
tooltip = 
manpage = Spacing of edge function grid in short and long directions.  The
default is 6 pixels in each direction for frame sizes up to 512 pixels,
increasing proportional to the maximum dimension of the frame above 512, up
to a value of 48.

[Field = IndentShortAndLong]
short = indents
type = IP
usage = Indentation of edge function from edge of overlap in short and long 
directions
tooltip = 
manpage = Borders at the edge of the overlap zone in the short and long 
directions which will be excluded when finding edge functions.  The default
size is 3 pixels in each direction for frame sizes up to 512 pixels,
increasing proportional to the maximum dimension of the frame above 512 up to
a value of 24 pixels.

[Field = GoodEdgeLowAndHighZ]
short = goodedge
type = IP
usage = Default lower and upper Z limits for where edge functions are good
tooltip = 
manpage = Default lower and upper Z limits for where edge functions are good
(numbered from 0).
Beyond these limits, the edge functions will be taken from the last good Z 
value.  If this option is entered, these limits will applied to all edges
except ones specified with onegood.

[Field = OneGoodEdgeLimits]
short = onegood
type = IAM
usage = Specification of an edge and Z limits within which its edge functions 
are good
tooltip = 
manpage = This options specifies lower and upper Z limits for a specific edge;
beyond these limits the edge functions will be taken from the last good Z
value.  Five values are expected: number of frame below the edge in X and Y
(numbered from 1), 1 for an edge in X or 2 for an edge in Y, lower and upper Z
limits (numbered from 0).

[Field = SameEdgeShifts]
short = same
type = B
usage = Edge shifts are the same on all sections; good edge limits can be used
tooltip =
manpage = Edge shifts are the same on all sections, so that it is possible to
use the -goodedge and -onegood options even though pieces are being shifted.
If pieces are being shifted, the program will not accept the good edge limit
options unless this option is given.

[Field = ExcludeFillFromEdges]
short = exclude
type = B
usage = Exclude areas filled with constant values from edge functions
tooltip = 
manpage = With this option on, the program will detect image areas near an
overlap zone that consist of uniform values and exclude these areas when
computing the edge function.  In addition, in areas along an edge where one
piece consists of uniform values and the other has actual image data, it will
use the actual data across the whole edge instead of transitioning to the
uniform data.

[Field = UnsmoothedPatchFile]
short = unsmooth
type = FN
usage = Text file for unsmoothed edge functions to be output as patch vectors
tooltip =
manpage = Text file for edge functions before smoothing to be output as 
displacement vectors.  This file can be converted to an IMOD model with
"patch2imod -l -f"; use the -s option to control how much the vector lengths
are scaled.  Each edge is output at a different Z value, so the model can be
viewed in the Zap window.  You can use this model to assess whether the box 
size is large enough to give accurate edge functions.

[Field = SmoothedPatchFile]
short = smooth
type = FN
usage = Text file for smoothed edge functions to be output as patch vectors
tooltip =
manpage = Text file for edge functions after smoothing to be output as
displacement vectors.  This file can be converted to an IMOD model with
"patch2imod -l -f".  This model shows the functions actually applied when
blending the overlap zones.

^These options allow for running a blending operation in parallel using
Splitblend(1).

[Field = ParallelMode]
short = parallel

usage = Mode for setting up or running parallel blend, and 1 for chunks in Y
tooltip = 
manpage = Mode for setting up or running a parallel blend.  The second value
should be 0 for chunks in Z, or 1 for chunks in Y.  The possibilities 
for the first value are:
^   > 0: The program will check for the legality of blending in parallel and
output subset section or line lists for running with the given number of target
chunks.  
^  -1: The program will create and write the header for a common output file
to be written directly by multiple blends.
^  -2: The program will write the given subset of sections directly to a
common output file.
^  -3: The program will take the SubsetToDo as the SectionsToDo and write
these sections to a new file; multiple files will need to be stacked
afterwards.  It should not be necessary to write multiple files; increase the
boundary pixels if artifacts occur when writing to a single file.

[Field = SubsetToDo]
short = subset
type = LI
usage = Subset of sections to do in parallel blend
tooltip =

directly writing in parallel to a single output file.

[Field = EdgeFunctionsOnly]
short = functions
type = I
usage = Just compute edge functions (1 for X, 2 for Y, 3 for both)
tooltip =
manpage = Compute edge functions (and correlations, if appropriate) then exit.
Enter 1 or 2 for X or Y edges alone, or 3 to compute both.  If 1 or 2 is
entered and edge correlation displacements are being written to a file, then
the first or second half of the file is produced in a file with extension
".xecd" or ".yecd", and the two halves may simply be concatenated to obtain
the full file.  Blendmont will produce a concatenated file when it is told to
read in the edge displacements and it finds only these two partial files.

[SectionHeader = XCOptions]
usage = CROSS-CORRELATION CONTROL OPTIONS 
manpage = CROSS-CORRELATION CONTROL OPTIONS
^  These options control the cross-correlations used to find
the initial alignment in the overlap zones when montages are sloppy.

[Field = AspectRatioForXcorr]
short = aspect
type = F
usage = Maximum aspect ratio of areas cross-correlated in overlap zones
tooltip = 
manpage = Maximum aspect ratio of areas cross-correlated in overlap zones.
The default is 2, which is generally adequate.  Larger values are required if
the displacements can be very large, but the value should not be made much
larger than necessary because the correlations will take longer to compute and 
may be poorer quality if there is substantial distortion between the two images
in an overlap zone.  The value determines the length of the area relative to
the width of the overlap zone, before any expansion of the correlated width
with the -extra option.

[Field = PadFraction]
short = pad
type = F
usage = Fraction to pad areas correlated in overlap zones
tooltip = 
manpage = Areas from the overlap zones will be padded by this fraction on
each side for correlation.  The default value is 0.45, which allows large
shifts to be measured unambiguously.  Padding for the short dimension will be 
this fraction times the size in that dimension; padding in the long dimension
will be either this fraction times the long dimension size, or 0.9 times the
size in the short dimension, whichever is smaller.

[Field = ExtraXcorrWidth]
short = extra
type = F
usage = Fraction to increase width of areas correlated in overlap zones
tooltip = 
manpage = This entry will increase the width of the areas correlated in
overlap zones by including image area in the interior of each frame, i.e.,
outside the overlap zone.  The width of the extra area is this fraction times
the width of the area within the overlap zone.  This option is appropriate if
montages are very sloppy, particularly if they tend to overlap by much more
than the nominal amount.

[Field = NumberOfXcorrPeaks]
short = numpeaks
type = I
usage = Number of cross-correlation peaks to analyze for correlation 
coefficient
tooltip = 
manpage = If this entry is greater than one, the program will keep track of
this number of the strongest peaks in the cross-correlation, and for each
peak, it will compute a correlation coefficient in real space from the pixels
that overlap in the areas extracted from the overlap zone.  The areas will
each be filtered with the same filter applied in the cross-correlation.  This
option is appropriate if montages are very sloppy, because the raw peak
strength of a correlation is less the lower the overlap between the areas
correlated, and it is easy for a spurious peak to become stronger than the
true peak when there is much displacement between the areas.  The true peak
will generally still give a stronger correlation coefficient in such a case.
This value is set to 1 by default unless VerySloppyMontage is entered, in
which case the default is 16.

[Field = FilterRadius1]
short = radius1
type = F
usage = Left cutoff radius for correlation filter
tooltip = 
manpage = When this entry is positive, low spatial frequencies in the overlap
zone cross-correlations will be attenuated by a Gaussian curve that is 1 at
this cutoff radius and falls off below this radius with a standard deviation
specified by FilterSigma2.  Spatial frequency units range from 0 to 0.5.
A negative entry is used to set the starting point of the filter specified
by FilterSigma1, which gives a more predictable attenuation of low frequencies.

[Field = FilterRadius2]
short = radius2
type = F
usage = Right cutoff radius for correlation filter (default 0.35)
tooltip = 
manpage = High spatial frequencies in the cross-correlation will be attenuated
by a Gaussian curve that is 1 at this cutoff radius and falls off above this
radius with a standard deviation specified by FilterSigma2.  The default is
0.35.

[Field = FilterSigma1]
short = sigma1
type = F
usage = Sigma for low-frequency inverted Gaussian correlation filter
tooltip = 
manpage = Sigma value to filter low frequencies in the correlations with a
curve that is an inverted Gaussian.  This filter is 0 at 0 frequency and decays
up to 1 with the given sigma value.  However, if a negative value of radius1
is entered, this filter will be zero from 0 to |radius1| then decay up to 1.
The default is 0.05.

[Field = FilterSigma2]
short = sigma2
type = F
usage = Sigma for Gaussian rolloff below radius1 and above radius2 (default 
0.05)
tooltip =
manpage = Sigma value for the Gaussian rolloff below and above the cutoff
frequencies specified by FilterRadius1 and FilterRadius2.  The default is 0.05.

[Field = TreatFillForXcorr]
short = treat
type = I
usage = Set treatment of fill areas created by distortion corrections
tooltip = 
manpage = Sets the treatment of fill areas created by distortion corrections
for the cross-correlations.  Enter 0 to do nothing, 1 to trim the correlation
width to exclude possible fill areas, or 2 to taper image into fill areas.  
The default is 1, appropriate for image-shift based montages with reliable
overlap widths.  If trimming overlap areas produces too little overlap, the
trimming can be avoided either with entry 0 or 2: 0 will leave
edges that may produce spurious correlation, while 2 will taper the image down
at the edges.  When VerySloppyMontage is used, there are distortion
corrections, and this option is not entered, the value is set to 2.
