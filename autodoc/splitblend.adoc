[Field = n]
short =
type = I
usage = Expected number of machines or processors (default 4) 
tooltip =
manpage = Expected number of machines or processors.  The default is 4. 
The number of chunks will be 4 times the number of processors, unless specified
with "-t".

[Field = t]
short =
type = I
usage = Target number of chunks (default is 4 times number of processors)
tooltip =
manpage = The desired number of chunks to set up.  The actual number will be
limited by the number of sections when chunks are in Z.

[Field = y]
short =
type = B
usage = Do chunks in Y instead of in Z  
tooltip =
manpage = Do chunks in Y instead of in Z.  Chunks in Y are chosen
automatically if there is only one section in Z.

[Field = e]
short =
type = B
usage = Do edge functions only, without blending images 
tooltip =
manpage = Compute edge functions without blending images.  This option is not
allowed if the command file specifies to use old edge functions, unless you
enter the "-r" option too.

[Field = u]
short =
type = B
usage = Use old edge functions and displacements; just blend images 
tooltip =
manpage = Just blend images using existing edge functions and displacements,
regardless of the values of the corresponding options in the command file.

[Field = r]
short =
type = B
usage = Recompute edge functions but use existing displacements 
tooltip =
manpage = Recompute edge functions using existing displacements between
pieces, regardless of the values of the corresponding options in the command
file.

[Field = b]
short =
type = I
usage = Number of boundary pixels between chunks (default 2048) 
tooltip =
manpage = Set the number of boundary pixels saved in separate files to the
given value.  The boundary pixels are rewritten to the output file after all
chunks are done.
