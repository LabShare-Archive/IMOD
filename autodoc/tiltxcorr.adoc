[Field = InputFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input image file
tooltip = Image file to correlate.
manpage = Input file with images to correlate.  If this option
is not entered, the first non-option argument will be used for this input
file.

[Field = PieceListFile]
short = piece
type = FN
usage = Piece file with rearranged Z values
tooltip = 
manpage = Piece list file for reordering the Z values in the stack

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output file for transforms or for patch tracking model
tooltip = Output file for transformations or for patch tracking model
manpage = Output file for transformations or for patch tracking model.  If
this option is not entered, the second non-option argument will be used for
this input file.

[Field = RotationAngle]
short = rotation
type = F
usage = Rotation angle from the Y axis to the tilt axis
tooltip = 
manpage = Angle of rotation of the tilt axis in the images; specifically, the
angle from the vertical to the tilt axis (counterclockwise positive).

[Field = FirstTiltAngle]
short = first
type = F
usage = Tilt angle of first view in degrees
tooltip = 
manpage = Tilt angle of first view, in degrees.  Use this option together with
TiltIncrement.

[Field = TiltIncrement]
short = increment
type = F
usage = Increment between tilt angles
tooltip = 
manpage = Increment between tilt angles, in degrees.  Use this option together
with FirstTiltAngle.

[Field = TiltFile]
short = tiltfile
type = FN
usage = File with tilt angles
tooltip = 
manpage = Use this option if tilt angles are in a file, one per line.

[Field = TiltAngles]
short = angles
type = FAM
usage = Individual tilt angles for each view
tooltip = 
manpage = Use this option to enter the tilt angles for each view individually,
in degrees.

[Field = AngleOffset]
short = offset
type = F
usage = Amount to add to all entered tilt angles
tooltip =
manpage = Amount to add to all entered tilt angles.  If the specimen is 
significantly tilted at zero tilt, then the amount of cosine stretching become
inaccurate at high tilt.  Sharper correlations can be obtained by adding this
angle offset, which is the same as the offset needed in Tiltalign(1) or
Tilt(1) to make the specimen flat in the reconstruction.

[Field = FilterRadius1]
short = radius1
type = F
usage = Left cutoff radius for filter
tooltip = 
manpage = Low spatial frequencies in the cross-correlation will be attenuated
by a Gaussian curve that is 1 at this cutoff radius and falls off below this
radius with a standard deviation specified by FilterSigma2.  Spatial
frequency units range from 0 to 0.5.  Use FilterSigma1 instead of this entry
for more predictable attenuation of low frequencies.

[Field = FilterRadius2]
short = radius2
type = F
usage = Right cutoff radius for filter
tooltip = High frequency cutoff radius for Gaussian filter
manpage = High spatial frequencies in the cross-correlation will be attenuated
by a Gaussian curve that is 1 at this cutoff radius and falls off above this
radius with a standard deviation specified by FilterSigma2.

[Field = FilterSigma1]
short = sigma1
type = F
usage = Sigma for low-frequency inverted Gaussian filter
tooltip = 
manpage = Sigma value to filter low frequencies in the correlations with a
curve that is an inverted Gaussian.  This filter is 0 at 0 frequency and decays
up to 1 with the given sigma value.  However, if a negative value of radius1
is entered, this filter will be zero from 0 to |radius1| then decay up to 1.

[Field = FilterSigma2]
short = sigma2
type = F
usage = Sigma for Gaussian rolloff below radius1 and above radius2
tooltip = Sigma for Gaussian rolloff below low frequency cutoff and above 
high frequency cutoff
manpage = Sigma value for the Gaussian rolloff below and above the cutoff
frequencies specified by FilterRadius1 and FilterRadius2

[Field = ExcludeCentralPeak]
short = exclude
type = B
usage = Exclude central correlation peak due to fixed pattern noise
tooltip = Ignore correlation peaks near (0, 0); do not use unless necessary
because nearly aligned images will become misaligned.
manpage = Exclude central correlation peak due to fixed pattern noise in the
images.  This option will misalign images that are already nearly aligned.

[Field = ShiftLimitsXandY]
short = shift
type = IP
usage = Limit on distance in X and Y to search for correlation peak
tooltip = 
manpage = Limit on distance in X and Y to search for correlation peak, in
pixels.  This option can be used to prevent a spurious correlation peak outside
these limits from giving a bad alignment.  If the program does not find an
actual peak, i.e. a pixel higher than all its neighbors, within these limits,
then it will give a zero shift.

[Field = BordersInXandY]
short = border
type = IP
usage = Number of pixels to trim off each edge in X and in Y
tooltip = Pixels to trim off each side in X, and in Y; the default is 0.
manpage = Number of pixels to trim off each edge in X and in Y (the default is
to use the whole image).

[Field = XMinAndMax]
short = xminmax
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending coordinates to correlate in X (overrides X border)
tooltip = Starting and ending coordinates to correlate in X (overrides
trimming in X)
manpage = Starting and ending X coordinates of a region to correlate, based on
the position of the region at zero tilt.  This
entry will override an X border value entered with BordersInXandY.

[Field = YMinAndMax]
short = yminmax
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending coordinates to correlate in Y (overrides Y border)
tooltip = Starting and ending coordinates to correlate in Y (overrides
trimming in Y)
manpage = Starting and ending Y coordinates of a region to correlate.  This
entry will override a Y border value entered with BordersInXandY.

[Field = BoundaryModel]
short = boundary
type = FN
usage = Model file with boundary contours around areas to correlate
tooltip =
manpage = Model file with boundary contours around areas to correlate.  When
correlating whole images to obtain transforms, the area outside the contours
is masked out; when tracking patches, only patches inside the contours will be
tracked (see above for details).

[Field = BoundaryObject]
short = objbound
type = I
usage = Object number to use from boundary model; default is all closed objects
tooltip =
manpage = The number of the object to use from the model with boundary
contours.  The default is to use all the contours in closed-contour objects,
but with this option only the given object will be used.

[Field = BinningToApply]
short = binning
type = I
usage = Binning to apply to the trimmed, padded images
tooltip = 
manpage = Binning to apply to the trimmed, padded images.  By default, a
binning will be selected that makes the maximum dimension of the trimmed,
padded image be no more than 1180 pixels, up to a binning of 4.  Binning will
increased above 4 only to the extent needed to make the image fit in the 
arrays.  This default behavior might result in more binning
than desired, and the binning might change when the amount of trimming
is changed.  This option allows direct control of the binning instead.

[Field = LeaveTiltAxisShifted]
short = leaveaxis
type = B
usage = Do not adjust tilt axis back to center if correlated box is not 
centered
tooltip = 
manpage = Leave the tilt axis in the center of the region that was correlated;
the default is to shift it back to the center of the whole image.  With this
option, the program will output global transforms ready to use in Newstack(1),
rather than the transforms relating one view to the next that would need to be
converted to global transforms with Xftoxg(1).  The reason for this difference
is that the transforms must contain a net shift away from the center of the
image, which would be lost in Xftoxg(1).

[Field = PadsInXandY]
short = pad
type = IP
usage = Number of pixels to pad images in X and in Y
tooltip = Padding in X, and in Y; the default is 5% of the image size up to 20
pixels.
manpage = Number of pixels to pad images in X and in Y.  The default is 5% of
the image dimensions up to 20 pixels.

[Field = TapersInXandY]
short = taper
type = IP
usage = Number of pixels to taper images in X and in Y
tooltip = Pixels to taper in X, and in Y; the default is 10% of the image size
up to 100 pixels.
manpage = Number of pixels to taper images in X and in Y.  The default
is 10% of the image dimensions up to 100 pixels.

[Field = StartingEndingViews]
short = views
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending view numbers for doing a subset of views
tooltip = Starting and ending view numbers to correlate (numbered from 1); 
the default is all views.
manpage = Starting and ending view numbers, numbered from 1, for doing 
a subset of views.

[Field = CumulativeCorrelation]
short = cumulative
type = B
usage = Add up previously aligned pictures as reference for next alignment
tooltip = 
manpage = Use this option to add up previously aligned pictures to get the
reference for the next alignment.  Alignments will start at low tilt and
work up to high tilt.

[Field = AbsoluteCosineStretch]
short = absstretch
type = B
usage = Cosine stretch each image added into the cumulative sum
tooltip = 
manpage = Stretch each image added into the cumulative sum by 1 over the
cosine of its tilt angle.

[Field = NoCosineStretch]
short = nostretch
type = B
usage = Do not do any cosine stretching for correlations or for accumulating
into the reference (overrides -absstretch)
tooltip = 
manpage = Do not do any cosine stretching for correlations or for accumulating
into the reference (this option overrides AbsoluteCosineStretch).

[Field = IterateCorrelations]
short = iterate
type = I
usage = Number of iterations to reduce interpolation of peak position
tooltip =
manpage = Number of iterations of the correlation.  After finding the
pixel with the peak correlation, the program achieves subpixel accuracy by
fitting a parabola to the correlation values in X or Y and interpolating from
the parabola.  If the correlation is iterated, this subpixel shift is applied
to the cosine-stretched image
before the correlation, which tends to shift the peak to being exactly on a
pixel.  As a result, the shift has slightly higher subpixel accuracy than when
it is derived by parabolic interpolation.  The program will terminate the
iterations if the remaining fractional shift is less than 0.02 pixel or if 
a lower correlation value is obtained than on the previous iteration.  In the
latter case it reverts to the shift that gave the highest correlation.  Two or
three iterations are generally sufficient.  Iteration is not programmed
efficiently, so computation time will be proportional to the number of
iterations.

[Field = SizeOfPatchesXandY]
short = size
type = IP
usage = Size in X and Y of patches to track by correlation
tooltip =
manpage = Size in X and Y of patches to track by correlation.  This option
will cause the program to track a set of patches of the given size from the
starting view to the high tilt view in each direction, and to output the
positions of the patch centers in an IMOD model.  By default, patches will
overlap in each direction by the default value for the -overlap option (see
below).  You can change the overlap with the -overlap option, specify the
number of patches directly with the -number option, or enter a model of
points to track with the -seed option, but you can enter only one of these
options.  Patch tracking cannot be used with cumulative correlation.

[Field = NumberOfPatchesXandY]
short = number
type = IP
usage = Number of patches in X and Y to track by correlation
tooltip =
manpage = Number of patches in X and Y to track by correlation.  The given
number of patches will be regularly spaced apart and fill the X and Y ranges
of the trimmed image area.

[Field = OverlapOfPatchesXandY]
short = overlap
type = IP
usage = Fractional overlap in X and Y between patches (default 0.33, 0.33)
tooltip =
manpage = Fractional overlap in X and Y between patches that are tracked by
correlation.  These overlaps are used to determine the number of patches when
-number is not entered.  The default, 0.33, 0.33, which will make patches that
overlap by one-third in each direction.  A value of 0 will result in no
overlap, and values less than 0 will result in space between the patches.

[Field = SeedModel]
short = seed
type = FN
usage = Input model file with center points to track by correlation
tooltip =
manpage = Input model file with center points to track by correlation.  Only
points whose patches fit entirely within the trimmed image area at zero
degrees will be tracked.  See above for details.

[Field = SeedObject]
short = objseed
type = I
usage = Number of object to use in seed model; default is all scattered objects
tooltip =
manpage = Number of the object from the seed model with the points for
tracking patches.  The default is to
use all objects containing scattered points; with this option only the given
object will be used. 

[Field = LengthAndOverlap]
short = length
type = IP
usage = Contour length and minimum overlap for breaking contour into pieces
tooltip = 
manpage = When tracking patches by correlation, the default is to produce one
contour per patch passing through the whole set of views.  With this option,
the contour will be broken into pieces of the given length, and overlapping
by at least the given amount.  If the centers of the tracked areas wander
enough to give a bad fit when the resulting model is used in Tiltalign(1),
then breaking the contours into overlapping pieces might improve the fit.
Some overlap is needed to use the model in Tiltalign (1).  

[Field = TestOutput]
short = test
type = FN
usage = File to save processed images and correlations into
tooltip = 
manpage = Specify a filename with this option to have two padded, tapered
images and the cross-correlation saved for every pair of images that are 
correlated. 

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.

[Field = usage]
short = help
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage =
