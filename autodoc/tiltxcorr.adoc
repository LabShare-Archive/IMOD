manpage = Low spatial frequencies in the cross-correlation will be attenuated
by a Gaussian curve that is 1 at this cutoff radius and falls off below this
radius with a standard deviation specified by FilterSigma2.  Spatial
frequency units range from 0 to 0.5.  Use FilterSigma1 instead of this entry
for more predictable attenuation of low frequencies.

usage = Sigma for low-frequency inverted Gaussian filter
tooltip = 
manpage = Sigma value to filter low frequencies in the correlations with a
curve that is an inverted Gaussian.  This filter is 0 at 0 frequency and decays
up to 1 with the given sigma value.  However, if a negative value of radius1
is entered, this filter will be zero from 0 to |radius1| then decay up to 1.

[Field = ExcludeCentralPeak]

usage = Exclude central correlation peak due to fixed pattern noise
tooltip = Ignore correlation peaks near (0, 0); do not use unless necessary because
nearly aligned images will become misaligned.

[Field = BinningToApply]
short = bin
type = I
usage = Binning to apply to the trimmed, padded images
tooltip = 
manpage = Binning to apply to the trimmed, padded images.  By default, a
binning will be selected that makes the maximum dimension of the trimmed,
padded image be no more than 1200 pixels, up to a binning of 4.  Binning will
increased above 4 only to the extent needed to make the image fit in the 
arrays.  This default behavior might result in more binning
than desired, and the binning might change when the amount of trimming
is changed.  This option allows direct control of the binning instead.

[Field = LeaveTiltAxisShifted]
short = leaveaxis
type = B
usage = Do not adjust tilt axis back to center if correlated box is not 
centered

tooltip = 
manpage = Use this option to add up previously aligned pictures to get the
reference for the next alignment.  Alignments will start at low tilt and
work up to high tilt.

[Field = AbsoluteCosineStretch]
short = absstretch
type = B
usage = Cosine stretch each image added into the cumulative sum
tooltip = 
manpage = Stretch each image added into the cumulative sum by 1 over the
