[Field = InputFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input image file
tooltip = Image file to correlate.
manpage = Input file with images to correlate.  If this option
is not entered, the first non-option argument will be used for this input
file.

[Field = PieceListFile]
short = piece
type = FN
usage = Piece file with rearranged Z values
tooltip = 
manpage = Piece list file for reordering the Z values in the stack

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output file for transforms or for patch tracking model
tooltip = Output file for transformations or for patch tracking model
manpage = Output file for transformations or for patch tracking model.  If
this option is not entered, the second non-option argument will be used for
this input file.

[Field = RotationAngle]
short = rotation
type = F
usage = Rotation angle from the Y axis to the tilt axis
tooltip = 
manpage = Angle of rotation of the tilt axis in the images; specifically, the
angle from the vertical to the tilt axis (counterclockwise positive).

[Field = FirstTiltAngle]
short = first
type = F
usage = Tilt angle of first view in degrees
tooltip = 
manpage = Tilt angle of first view, in degrees.  Use this option together with
TiltIncrement.

[Field = TiltIncrement]
short = increment
type = F
usage = Increment between tilt angles
tooltip = 
manpage = Increment between tilt angles, in degrees.  Use this option together
with FirstTiltAngle.

[Field = TiltFile]
short = tiltfile
type = FN
usage = File with tilt angles
tooltip = 
manpage = Use this option if tilt angles are in a file, one per line.

[Field = TiltAngles]
short = angles
type = FAM
usage = Individual tilt angles for each view
tooltip = 
manpage = Use this option to enter the tilt angles for each view individually,
in degrees.

[Field = AngleOffset]
short = offset
type = F
usage = Amount to add to all entered tilt angles
tooltip = Amount to add to all entered tilt angles.  If the angle offset
needed to make the specimen level in the reconstruction is more than a few
degrees, applying this offset here will sharpen the correlations.
manpage = Amount to add to all entered tilt angles.  If the specimen is 
significantly tilted at zero tilt, then the amount of cosine stretching become
inaccurate at high tilt.  Sharper correlations can be obtained by adding this
angle offset, which is the same as the offset needed in Tiltalign(1) or
Tilt(1) to make the specimen flat in the reconstruction.

[Field = ReverseOrder]
short = reverse
type = B
usage = Reverse order of processing when all views have same tilt angle
tooltip = 
manpage = Reverse order of processing when all views have same tilt angle.
Specifically, this will cause the program to start with the last view at
minimum tilt instead of the first one.

[Field = FilterRadius1]
short = radius1
type = F
usage = Left cutoff radius for filter
tooltip = 
manpage = Low spatial frequencies in the cross-correlation will be attenuated
by a Gaussian curve that is 1 at this cutoff radius and falls off below this
radius with a standard deviation specified by FilterSigma2.  Spatial
frequency units range from 0 to 0.5.  Use FilterSigma1 instead of this entry
for more predictable attenuation of low frequencies.

[Field = FilterRadius2]
short = radius2
type = F
usage = Right cutoff radius for filter
tooltip = High frequency cutoff radius for Gaussian filter
manpage = High spatial frequencies in the cross-correlation will be attenuated
by a Gaussian curve that is 1 at this cutoff radius and falls off above this
radius with a standard deviation specified by FilterSigma2.

[Field = FilterSigma1]
short = sigma1
type = F
usage = Sigma for low-frequency inverted Gaussian filter
tooltip = 
manpage = Sigma value to filter low frequencies in the correlations with a
curve that is an inverted Gaussian.  This filter is 0 at 0 frequency and decays
up to 1 with the given sigma value.  However, if a negative value of radius1
is entered, this filter will be zero from 0 to |radius1| then decay up to 1.

[Field = FilterSigma2]
short = sigma2
type = F
usage = Sigma for Gaussian rolloff below radius1 and above radius2
tooltip = Sigma for Gaussian rolloff below low frequency cutoff and above 
high frequency cutoff
manpage = Sigma value for the Gaussian rolloff below and above the cutoff
frequencies specified by FilterRadius1 and FilterRadius2

[Field = ExcludeCentralPeak]
short = exclude
type = B
usage = Exclude central correlation peak due to fixed pattern noise
tooltip = Ignore correlation peaks near (0, 0); do not use unless necessary
because nearly aligned images will become misaligned.
manpage = Exclude central correlation peak due to fixed pattern noise in the
images.  This option will misalign images that are already nearly aligned.

[Field = ShiftLimitsXandY]
short = shift
type = IP
usage = Limit on distance in X and Y to search for correlation peak
tooltip = Limit on distance in X and Y to search for correlation peak, in
pixels.  Images or patch centers will not shift by more than this amount
between views.
manpage = Limit on distance in X and Y to search for correlation peak, in
pixels before binning is applied internally.  This option can be used to
prevent a spurious correlation peak outside these limits from giving a bad
alignment.  If the program does not find an actual peak, i.e. a pixel higher
than all its neighbors, within these limits, then it will give a zero shift.
If cumulative correlations are being used, the program will seek a peak within
this distance of the peak for the previous view and assign that view's shift
instead of zero if no peak is found.

[Field = BordersInXandY]
short = border
type = IP
usage = Number of pixels to trim off each edge in X and in Y
tooltip = Pixels to trim off each side in X, and in Y; the default is 0.  Some
trimming should be used with patch tracking.
manpage = Number of pixels to trim off each edge in X and in Y (the default is
to use the whole image).

[Field = XMinAndMax]
short = xminmax
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending coordinates to correlate in X (overrides X border)
tooltip = Starting and ending coordinates to correlate in X (overrides
trimming in X)
manpage = Starting and ending X coordinates of a region to correlate, based on
the position of the region at zero tilt.  This
entry will override an X border value entered with BordersInXandY.

[Field = YMinAndMax]
short = yminmax
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending coordinates to correlate in Y (overrides Y border)
tooltip = Starting and ending coordinates to correlate in Y (overrides
trimming in Y)
manpage = Starting and ending Y coordinates of a region to correlate.  This
entry will override a Y border value entered with BordersInXandY.

[Field = BoundaryModel]
short = boundary
type = FN
usage = Model file with boundary contours around areas to correlate
tooltip = Model file with boundary contours around areas to correlate or areas
to track patches within.
manpage = Model file with boundary contours around areas to correlate.  When
correlating whole images to obtain transforms, the area outside the contours
is masked out; when tracking patches, only patches inside the contours will be
tracked (see above for details).

[Field = BoundaryObject]
short = objbound
type = I
usage = Object number to use from boundary model; default is all closed objects
tooltip =
manpage = The number of the object to use from the model with boundary
contours.  The default is to use all the contours in closed-contour objects,
but with this option only the given object will be used.

[Field = BinningToApply]
short = binning
type = I
usage = Binning or other reduction to apply to the trimmed, padded images
tooltip = 
manpage = Binning or other reduction to apply to the trimmed, padded images.
Ordinary binning is used unless the -antialias option is given.
By default, a reduction will be selected that makes the maximum dimension of the
trimmed, padded image be no more than 1180 pixels, up to a reduction of 4.
Reduction will be increased above 4 only to the extent needed to make the image
fit in the arrays.  This default behavior might result in more reduction
than desired, and the reduction might change when the amount of trimming
is changed.  This option allows direct control of the reduction instead.

[Field = AntialiasFilter]
short = antialias
type = I
usage = Type of antialiasing filter to reduce images with instead of binning
tooltip =
manpage = Type of antialiasing filter to use for image reduction instead of
binning.  Antialiasing becomes important when the images contain a strong
noise component at the high frequencies being eliminated by the image
reduction.  Ordinary binning reduces aliasing, but not as much as these filters
do.  As in Newstack(1), the available types here are:
^    2: Blackman - fast but not as good at antialiasing as slower filters
^    3: Triangle - fast but smooths more than Blackman
^    4: Mitchell - good at antialiasing, smooths a bit
^    5: Lanczos 2 lobes - good at antialiasing, less smoothing than Mitchel
^    6: Lanczos 3 lobes - slower, even less smoothing but more risk of ringing

[Field = LeaveTiltAxisShifted]
short = leaveaxis
type = B
usage = Do not adjust tilt axis back to center if correlated box is not 
centered
tooltip = 
manpage = Leave the tilt axis in the center of the region that was correlated;
the default is to shift it back to the center of the whole image.  With this
option, the program will output global transforms ready to use in Newstack(1),
rather than the transforms relating one view to the next that would need to be
converted to global transforms with Xftoxg(1).  The reason for this difference
is that the transforms must contain a net shift away from the center of the
image, which would be lost in Xftoxg(1).

[Field = PadsInXandY]
short = pad
type = IP
usage = Number of pixels to pad images in X and in Y
tooltip = Padding in X, and in Y; the default is 5% of the image size up to 20
pixels.
manpage = Number of pixels to pad images in X and in Y.  The default is 5% of
the image dimensions up to 20 pixels.

[Field = TapersInXandY]
short = taper
type = IP
usage = Number of pixels to taper images in X and in Y
tooltip = Pixels to taper in X, and in Y; the default is 10% of the image size
up to 100 pixels.
manpage = Number of pixels to taper images in X and in Y.  The default
is 10% of the image dimensions up to 100 pixels.

[Field = StartingEndingViews]
short = views
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending view numbers for doing a subset of views
tooltip = Starting and ending view numbers to correlate (numbered from 1); 
the default is all views.
manpage = Starting and ending view numbers, numbered from 1, for doing 
a subset of views.

[Field = SkipViews]
short = skip
type = LI
usage = List of views to skip, aligning across skipped views (ranges OK)
tooltip =
manpage = List of views to skip, while maintaining alignment across skipped
views.  The program will not find the transform for aligning a listed view to
the previous one.  When a view is skipped, the following view will be aligned
to the last unskipped view and a unit transform will be output for the skipped
view.  With patch tracking, no model points will be placed on the skipped
views.  Comma-separated ranges of views (numbered from 1) can be entered.  The
default is to use all of the views.

[Field = BreakAtViews]
short = break
type = LI
usage = List of views to break alignment at (ranges OK)
tooltip =
manpage = List of views to break alignment at.  This option is like
"-skip"
in that no transform is found for aligning a listed view to
the previous one and a unit transform is written for the listed view.
However, the following view will be aligned to the
listed view, and nothing will be aligned to the previous view.  This
breaks the chain of alignment through the series of views.  This option
cannot be used with patch tracking.

[Field = CumulativeCorrelation]
short = cumulative
type = B
usage = Add up previously aligned pictures as reference for next alignment
tooltip = 
manpage = Use this option to add up previously aligned pictures to get the
reference for the next alignment.  Alignments will start at low tilt and
work up to high tilt.

[Field = AbsoluteCosineStretch]
short = absstretch
type = B
usage = Cosine stretch each image added into the cumulative sum
tooltip = 
manpage = Stretch each image added into the cumulative sum by 1 over the
cosine of its tilt angle.

[Field = NoCosineStretch]
short = nostretch
type = B
usage = Do not do any cosine stretching for correlations or for accumulating
into the reference (overrides -absstretch)
tooltip = 
manpage = Do not do any cosine stretching for correlations or for accumulating
into the reference (this option overrides AbsoluteCosineStretch).

[Field = IterateCorrelations]
short = iterate
type = I
usage = Number of iterations to reduce interpolation of peak position
tooltip = Number of iterations of each correlation to reduce interpolation of
peak position.
manpage = Number of iterations of the correlation.  After finding the
pixel with the peak correlation, the program achieves subpixel accuracy by
fitting a parabola to the correlation values in X or Y and interpolating from
the parabola.  If the correlation is iterated, this subpixel shift is applied
to the cosine-stretched image
before the correlation, which tends to shift the peak to being exactly on a
pixel.  As a result, the shift has slightly higher subpixel accuracy than when
it is derived by parabolic interpolation.  The program will terminate the
iterations if the remaining fractional shift is less than 0.02 pixel or if 
a lower correlation value is obtained than on the previous iteration.  In the
latter case it reverts to the shift that gave the highest correlation.  Two or
three iterations are generally sufficient.  Iteration is not programmed
efficiently, so computation time will be proportional to the number of
iterations.

[Field = SizeOfPatchesXandY]
short = size
type = IP
usage = Size in X and Y of patches to track by correlation
tooltip =
manpage = Size in X and Y of patches to track by correlation.  This option
will cause the program to track a set of patches of the given size from the
starting view to the high tilt view in each direction, and to output the
positions of the patch centers in an IMOD model.  By default, patches will
overlap in each direction by the default value for the -overlap option (see
below).  You can change the overlap with the -overlap option, specify the
number of patches directly with the -number option, or enter a model of
points to track with the -seed option, but you can enter only one of these
options.  Patch tracking cannot be used with cumulative correlation.

[Field = NumberOfPatchesXandY]
short = number
type = IP
usage = Number of patches in X and Y to track by correlation
tooltip =
manpage = Number of patches in X and Y to track by correlation.  The given
number of patches will be regularly spaced apart and fill the X and Y ranges
of the trimmed image area.

[Field = OverlapOfPatchesXandY]
short = overlap
type = IP
usage = Fractional overlap in X and Y between patches (default 0.33, 0.33)
tooltip =
manpage = Fractional overlap in X and Y between patches that are tracked by
correlation.  These overlaps are used to determine the number of patches when
-number is not entered.  The default, 0.33, 0.33, which will make patches that
overlap by one-third in each direction.  A value of 0 will result in no
overlap, and values less than 0 will result in space between the patches.

[Field = SeedModel]
short = seed
type = FN
usage = Input model file with center points to track by correlation
tooltip =
manpage = Input model file with center points to track by correlation.  Only
points whose patches fit entirely within the trimmed image area at zero
degrees will be tracked.  See above for details.

[Field = SeedObject]
short = objseed
type = I
usage = Number of object to use in seed model; default is all scattered objects
tooltip =
manpage = Number of the object from the seed model with the points for
tracking patches.  The default is to
use all objects containing scattered points; with this option only the given
object will be used. 

[Field = LengthAndOverlap]
short = length
type = IP
usage = Contour length and minimum overlap for breaking contour into pieces
tooltip = Contour length and minimum overlap for breaking contour into
pieces, which will reduce residuals in Tiltalign if patch positions are not
consistent through the whole tilt series.
manpage = When tracking patches by correlation, the default is to produce one
contour per patch passing through the whole set of views.  With this option,
the contour will be broken into pieces of the given length, and overlapping
by at least the given amount.  If the centers of the tracked areas wander
enough to give a bad fit when the resulting model is used in Tiltalign(1),
then breaking the contours into overlapping pieces might improve the fit.
Some overlap is needed to use the model in Tiltalign (1).  

[Field = PrealignmentTransformFile]
short = prexf
type = FN
usage = File with transforms used to align images for patch tracking
tooltip = 
manpage = File with transformations applied to align the images being used for
patch tracking.  With the shift information in these transforms, each patch is
evaluated for whether it contains blank image area because of the shifting.
Patches that are more than 30% blank will not be tracked further, and patches
with some blank area less than this amount will be tapered down to the edge of
the blank area.

[Field = ImagesAreBinned]
short = imagebinned
type = I
usage = The current binning of the images relative to raw stack
tooltip = 
manpage = The current binning of the images relative to the unaligned stack.
This entry is needed to scale the transforms supplied with the -prexf option
if the binning is not 1.

[Field = UnalignedSizeXandY]
short = unali
type = IP
usage = Size of unaligned stack in X and Y
tooltip =
manpage = The full size of the unaligned stack that was transformed to create
the images being aligned with patch tracking.  This entry is needed if 
an output size was specified when creating the stack being aligned and if
transforms are supplied with the -prexf option.

[Field = FindWarpTransforms]
short = warp
type = B
usage = Use patch correlations to find and save warping transformations
tooltip = 
manpage = Use patch correlations to find and save warping transformations
between successive images.  The output file will be a file with warp
transforms, not a model.  Tilt angles cannot be entered with this option, nor can
the -reverse option.  As with patch tracking generally, you can skip views but
not break the alignment at views.  Limits in X and Y and a boundary model can
be used to constrain patch locations, but there must be at least 3 patches in
the area defined by all the boundary contours.

[Field = TestOutput]
short = test
type = FN
usage = File to save processed images and correlations into
tooltip = 
manpage = Specify a filename with this option to have two padded, tapered
images and the cross-correlation saved for every pair of images that are 
correlated. 

[Field = VerboseOutput]
short = verbose
type = B
usage = Output diagnostic information
tooltip =
manpage = 

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.

[Field = usage]
short = help
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage =
