[Field = InputWarpFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Name of input transform file with warping control points
tooltip =
manpage = Name of input transform file with warping control points.  When
eTomo runs Finishjoin(1), this is the file "joinroot.xf".
If this option is not entered, the first nonoption argument is used for this
filename.  One or the other entry is required.

[Field = OutputModelFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Name of output file for model of warp points
tooltip =
manpage = Name of output file for model of warp points.
If this option is not entered, the second nonoption argument is used for this
filename.  One or the other entry is required.

[Field = JoinedFile]
short = joined
type = FN
usage = Name of join file being modeled
tooltip =
manpage = Name of join file being modeled.  After "Refine Join" is pressed in
eTomo, this is the file "joinroot_modeled.join".  If this filename is not
entered, then the "-size" and "-pixel" options must be entered.

[Field = AppliedTransformFile]
short = xform
type = FN
usage = Name of file of G transforms applied to make the join file
tooltip =
manpage = Name of file of G transforms applied to make the join file.  When
Finishjoin(1) is run without the "-xform" option, this is the file
"joinroot.tomoxg", which is copied to "joinroot.warpxg" if there is warping. 
However, when Finishjoin(1) is run with the "-xform"
option to make the refined join, "joinroot.tomoxg" is the final transform
file, not the file needed here.  Thus, use "joinroot.warpxg".  This entry is required.

[Field = SizeOfJoinInXandY]
short = size
type = IP
usage = Actual size in X and Y of the join file being modeled
tooltip =
manpage = Actual size in X and Y of the join file being modeled, in binned
pixels if binning was used.  This entry is needed if "-joined" is not entered.

[Field = PixelSpacing]
short = pixel
type = F
usage = Actual pixel spacing in Angstroms of join file being modeled
tooltip =
manpage = Actual pixel spacing in Angstroms of join file being modeled, which
includes any binning applied to make the file.  This entry is needed if
"-joined" is not entered.

[Field = OffsetInXandY]
short = offset
type = IP
usage = Unbinned offset applied when building the join file
tooltip =
manpage = Offset applied when building the join file, in unbinned pixels if
binning was applied.  This entry should be the same as the "-offset" entry to
Finishjoin(1), which is the negative of the "Shift" values in the text boxes in
eTomo.

[Field = BinningOfJoin]
short = binning
type = I
usage = Binning applied when building the join file
tooltip =
manpage = Binning applied when building the join file; this entry is required
if binning was applied. 

[Field = ChunkSizes]
short = chunks
type = IA
usage = Number of slices in each section of the join file
tooltip =
manpage = Number of slices in each section of the join file.  This entry
is required so that the program can put the model points at the right
locations just before and after each junction between sections.
