[Field = CommandFile]
short = co
type = FN
usage = Command file for reconstruction (with or without extension)
tooltip =
manpage = Command file for reconstruction, which can be entered with or
without its extension of ".com".  If this option is not entered, a non-option
argument is used for the command file.

[Field = NumberOfProcessors]
short = nu
type = I
usage = Target or expected number of machines (default 8, or 1 if GPU is used)
tooltip =
manpage = Use this option to specify the number of machines that you expect to
run the command files on.  It is passed directly to Splittilt(1) unless it is
1, in which case the processing is not divided into chunks.  The default is
8 unless the command file contains the option to use the GPU, in which case it
is 1.

[Field = StartFromZero]
short = st
type = B
usage = Start from initial reconstruction even if iterations have been done
tooltip =
manpage = Do an initial reconstruction, numbered 00, even if it or later 
reconstructions already exist.  The default is to iterate from the last
existing reconstruction.

[Field = IterationsToRun]
short = it
type = I
usage = Number of iterations to run (default 10)
tooltip =
manpage = Set the number of iterations to run.  If this option is not entered,
the number that will be run depends on whether the LeaveIterations option is
used.  If it is not, 10 iterations will be done.  If it is, iterations will be
done up to the last interation number in the list being left.

[Field = LeaveIterations]
short = le
type = LI
usage = Leave reconstructions at the listed iterations
tooltip =
manpage = Leave reconstructions at the listed iterations, which are numbered
by absolute iteration number.  For example, if 10 iterations have already been
done and you are doing another 10, entering 14,17-19 will retain the
reconstructions named setname.srec14, setname.srec17, etc, produced at the
4th, 7th, 8th and 9th new iteration.  In addition, the reconstruction from the
final iteration is always retained.

[Field = ScaleToInteger]
short = sc
type = FP
usage = Convert retained reconstructions to integers with given min/max
tooltip =
manpage = Scale each retained reconstruction to integers, with the minimum and
maximum in the reconstruction scaled to the given min and max values.  
Values of -20000,20000 are recommended.  This scaling
will reduce the space needed for retained reconstructions twofold, since by
default each reconstruction is generated as floating point.  This scaling is
done on each file just after it is produced, so at the end of the processing
the last reconstruction will be in both floating point and scaled integer
form.  The file setname.srec01 is scaled to setname.sint01, etc.

[Field = TrimvolOptions]
short = tr
type = CH
usage = Run trimvol with given options on retained reconstructions
tooltip =
manpage = Run Trimvol(1) on each retained reconstruction with the given
options.  The options must be enclosed in single or double quotes.  If the
options specify
a scaling to bytes, this will reduce the space needed for retained
reconstructions by at least fourfold.  Each reconstruction to be retained is
trimmed as soon as it is made, so at the end of the processing the last
reconstruction exists in both floating point and trimmed form.  The file
setname.srec01 is trimmed to setname.strm01, etc.  The trimvol options can
be extracted from etomo_err.log after running the Trimvol step in eTomo.

[Field = FlatFilterFraction]
short = fl
type = F
usage = Flat filter fraction for starting reconstruction (default 1.)
tooltip =
manpage = Set the fraction of a flat filter function to apply in the initial
reconstruction.  A flat function will be mixed with the standard radial filter
if the fraction is less than 1; this may given quicker convergence. 
The default is 1.0 for no mixing.

[Field = RadiusAndSigma]
short = rd
type = FP
usage = Radius and sigma for radial filter in all backprojections
tooltip =
manpage = Set the radius and sigma for the high-frequency cutoff of the radial
filter in the backprojections.  The default is 0.4,0.05 for a mild filtering.

[Field = PositiveConstraint]
short = zp
type = B
usage = Constrain reconstruction to positive values
tooltip =
manpage = Constrain the reconstruction to positive values when subtracting the
difference reconstruction.  This option, or NegativeConstraint, are
appropriate only if the projection data are normalized to be linearly
proportional to projected mass density and have positive or negative values,
respectively.  Invoking either of these options will prevent SIRT from being
done internally in Tilt(1).

[Field = NegativeConstraint]
short = zn
type = B
usage = Constrain reconstruction to negative values
tooltip =
manpage = Constrain the reconstruction to negative values when subtracting the
difference reconstruction.  See the PositiveConstraint option.

[Field = SeparateRecChunks]
short = ch
type = B
usage = Write reconstructions to separate chunks, not directly to file
tooltip =
manpage = Write reconstructions in chunks to separate files and assemble these
into a single tomogram.  The default is to write directly to the output file.
Neither this option nor the SeparateProjChunks option should not be needed
with the protections provided by saving pixels at chunk boundaries into
separate files; if artifacts do occur, try using the BoundaryPixels option to
increase the number of pixels saved.

[Field = SeparateProjChunks]
short = pc
type = B
usage = Write projections to separate chunks, not directly to file
tooltip =
manpage = Write reprojections in chunks to separate files instead of directly
to a single output file.  The separate files are assembled with
Assemblevol(1).  See the SeparateRecChunks option.

[Field = BoundaryPixels]
short = bo
type = I
usage = Number of boundary pixels when writing directly (default 2048)
tooltip =
manpage = Set the number of boundary pixels saved in separate files to the
given value when writing reconstructions or projections directly to a single
output file.  The boundary pixels are rewritten to the output file after all
chunks are done.

[Field = OutputMode]
short = mo
type = I
usage = Output file mode (default 2 for floating point numbers)
tooltip =
manpage = Set the mode of the output files.  The default is 2 because scaling
is somewhat unpredictable, and values generally become much larger than in
standard R-weighted back-projection with Tilt(1).

[Field = TestMode]
short = te
type = I
usage = Test mode, 1: retain proj, drec; 2: leave command and log files
tooltip =
manpage = Run in a test mode.  A value of 1 will leave the reprojection,
projection difference, and difference reconstruction at the end of every
iteration except when running SIRT internally in Tilt(1).  A value of 2 will
also leave command and log files at the end of the processing.
