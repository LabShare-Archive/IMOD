Version = 1.0
Pip = 1

[Field = CommandFile]
short = co
type = FN
usage = Command file for reconstruction (with or without extension)
tooltip =
manpage = Command file for reconstruction, which can be entered with or
without its extension of ".com".  If this option is not entered, a non-option
argument is used for the command file.

[Field = NumberOfProcessors]
short = nu
type = I
usage = Target or expected number of machines (default 8, or 1 if GPU is used)
tooltip =
manpage = Use this option to specify the number of machines that you expect to
run the command files on.  It is passed directly to Splittilt(1) unless it is
1, in which case the processing is not divided into chunks.  The default is
8 unless the command file contains the option to use the GPU, in which case it
is 1.

[Field = StartFromZero]
short = st
type = B
usage = Start from initial reconstruction even if iterations have been done
tooltip =
manpage = Do an initial reconstruction, numbered 00, even if it or later 
reconstructions already exist.  The default is to iterate from the last
existing reconstruction.

[Field = ResumeFromIteration]
short = re
type = I
usage = Resume from the given iteration rather than from the last one
tooltip =
manpage = Resume from the given iteration rather than from the last one.  You
can resume from any iteration that has a .srec file, but not from ones for
which there is only a scaled integer or trimmed file.

[Field = IterationsToRun]
short = it
type = I
usage = Number of iterations to run (default 10)
tooltip =
manpage = Set the number of iterations to run.  If this option is not entered,
the number that will be run depends on whether the LeaveIterations option is
used.  If it is not, 10 iterations will be done.  If it is, iterations will be
done up to the last interation number in the list being left.

[Field = LeaveIterations]
short = le
type = LI
usage = Leave reconstructions at the listed iterations
tooltip = Retain the reconstructions at the listed iterations, which are
numbered by absolute iteration number, not by iteration number in this round.
The highest number determines how many iterations will be run (if
"IterationsToRun" is not entered).
manpage = Leave reconstructions at the listed iterations, which are numbered
by absolute iteration number.  For example, if 10 iterations have already been
done and you are doing another 10, entering 14,17-19 will retain the
reconstructions named setname.srec14, setname.srec17, etc, produced at the
4th, 7th, 8th and 9th new iteration.  In addition, the reconstruction from the
final iteration is always retained.  

[Field = SkipVertSliceOutput]
short = sk
type = B
usage = Do not make vertical slice output files when running SIRT internally.
tooltip = Do not produce the vertical slice files that are output
along with each retained reconstruction when SIRT is done internally.  Such
files are used to avoid repeated interpolations.  Use this option for a large
reconstruction if disk space is an issue and you are leaving only the final
iteration.
manpage = Do not make the vertical slice output files that are needed for
resuming without interpolation when SIRT is done internally.  If the
iterations will be run internally in Tilt(1) and there is a non-zero X-axis
tilt, the default is to create an output file containing the internal,
vertical slices along with every regular reconstruction file.  When resuming
for the next iteration, using such a file avoids the effects of interpolating
twice between internal slices and reconstruction slices.  These effects are
much more severe for cryo data than plastic section data.  Use this option if
storage space is an issue and if you are leaving one iteration that you do not
anticipate resuming from.  The entry is irrelevant if you have Z-factors,
local alignments, no X-axis tilt, or varying X-axis tilt resulting from
solving for beam tilt.

[Field = CleanUpPastStart]
short = cl
type = B
usage = Remove all existing reconstructions past the starting point of this run
tooltip = Remove all existing reconstructions past the starting point of this
run, for the kind of reconstruction currently being done (subarea or full).
manpage = Remove all existing reconstructions past the starting point of this
run, for the kind of reconstruction currently being done (subarea or full).
Specifically, this includes files with extensions containing .srec, .sint, and
.strm and with a root name matching the root name used for subarea or full
reconstructions (see FILES).  Sirtsetup does not remove the files; rather, it
places a command to remove them into the first command file to be run and
outputs a list of the files that will be deleted.  If you resume at, say,
iteration 5, then the list will include all files numbered 06 and above.  If
you restart at the beginning, the list will include all existing files.

[Field = SubareaSize]
short = su
type = IP
usage = Size in X and Y of subarea to use from aligned stack, in binned pixels
tooltip = Size in X and Y of subarea to use from aligned stack, in binned
pixels if the aligned stack is binned.
manpage = Size in X and Y of a subarea to use from the aligned stack, in
actual pixels of that stack, which might be binned relative to the original
tilt series.  When a subarea is specified, output files are named differently
(see FILES).

[Field = YOffsetOfSubarea]
short = yo
type = I
usage = Offset in Y from center of aligned image to center of subarea
tooltip = Offset in Y from center of aligned image to center of subarea, in
binned pixels if the aligned stack is binned.
manpage = Offset in Y from center of aligned image to center of subarea
whose size is specified with the -su option.  The shifted subarea must lie
completely within the image area.  Enter a value in actual pixels of the
aligned stack (positive for an area above the center).  If you want to do more
iterations, you need to enter the same subarea size and offset as when you
started.

[Field = ScaleToInteger]
short = sc
type = FP
usage = Convert retained reconstructions to integers with given min/max
tooltip = Convert retained reconstructions to integers with (eTomo sets
the min and max for scaling to -20000/20000).
manpage = Scale each retained reconstruction to integers, with the minimum and
maximum in the reconstruction scaled to the given min and max values.  
Values of -20000,20000 are recommended.  This scaling
will reduce the space needed for retained reconstructions twofold, since by
default each reconstruction is generated as floating point.  This scaling is
done on each file just after it is produced, so at the end of the processing
the last reconstruction will be in both floating point and scaled integer
form.  The file setname.srec01 is scaled to setname.sint01, etc.

[Field = TrimvolOptions]
short = tr
type = CH
usage = Run trimvol with given options on retained reconstructions
tooltip =
manpage = Run Trimvol(1) on each retained reconstruction with the given
options.  The options must be enclosed in single or double quotes.  If the
options specify
a scaling to bytes, this will reduce the space needed for retained
reconstructions by at least fourfold.  Each reconstruction to be retained is
trimmed as soon as it is made, so at the end of the processing the last
reconstruction exists in both floating point and trimmed form.  The file
setname.srec01 is trimmed to setname.strm01, etc.  The trimvol options can
be extracted from etomo_err.log after running the Trimvol step in eTomo.

[Field = FlatFilterFraction]
short = fl
type = F
usage = Flat filter fraction for starting reconstruction (default 1.)
tooltip = The fraction of a flat filter function to apply in the initial
reconstruction.  The default is 1 to use just a flat filter; 0 will use just
the standard radial weighting filter and give an R-weighted backprojection;
values between 0 and 1 give a mixture between the two starting reconstructions
and may give quicker convergence.
manpage = Set the fraction of a flat filter function to apply in the initial
reconstruction.  A flat function will be mixed with the standard radial filter
if the fraction is less than 1; this may give quicker convergence. 
The default is 1.0 for no mixing.

[Field = RadiusAndSigma]
short = rd
type = FP
usage = Radius and sigma for radial filter in all backprojections
tooltip =
manpage = Set the radius and sigma for the high-frequency cutoff of the filter
used in the backprojections.  The default is 0.4,0.05 for a mild filtering.

[Field = ConstrainSign]
short = cs
type = B
usage = 1 or -1 to constrain reconstruction to positive or negative values
tooltip =
manpage = Enter 1 or -1 to constrain the reconstruction to positive or
negative values when subtracting the
difference reconstruction.  This option is
appropriate only if the projection data are normalized to be linearly
proportional to projected mass density and have positive or negative values,
respectively.

[Field = SeparateRecChunks]
short = ch
type = B
usage = Write reconstructions to separate chunks, not directly to file
tooltip =
manpage = Write reconstructions in chunks to separate files and assemble these
into a single tomogram.  The default is to write directly to the output file.
Neither this option nor the SeparateProjChunks option should be needed
with the protections provided by saving pixels at chunk boundaries into
separate files; if artifacts do occur, try using the BoundaryPixels option to
increase the number of pixels saved.

[Field = SeparateProjChunks]
short = pc
type = B
usage = Write projections to separate chunks, not directly to file
tooltip =
manpage = Write reprojections in chunks to separate files instead of directly
to a single output file.  The separate files are assembled with
Assemblevol(1).  See the SeparateRecChunks option.

[Field = BoundaryPixels]
short = bo
type = I
usage = Number of boundary pixels when writing directly (default 2048)
tooltip =
manpage = Set the number of boundary pixels saved in separate files to the
given value when writing reconstructions or projections directly to a single
output file.  The boundary pixels are rewritten to the output file after all
chunks are done.

[Field = OutputMode]
short = mo
type = I
usage = Output file mode (default 2 for floating point numbers)
tooltip =
manpage = Set the mode of the output files.  The default is 2 because scaling
is somewhat unpredictable, and values generally become much larger than in
standard R-weighted back-projection with Tilt(1).

[Field = TestMode]
short = te
type = I
usage = Test mode, 1: retain diff; 2: leave command and log files
tooltip =
manpage = Run in a test mode.  A value of 1 will leave the 
reprojection difference between iterations and at the end,
except when running SIRT internally in Tilt(1).  A value of 2 will
also leave command and log files at the end of the processing.
