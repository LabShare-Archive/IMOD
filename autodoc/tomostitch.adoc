[Field = InfoFile]
short = info
type = FN
usage = Name of supermontage info file
tooltip =
manpage = Name of a supermontage info file containing all the data about the
frames and sections.  If this option is not entered, the first non-option
argument will be taken as the name of the info file.

[Field = XRunStartEnd]
short = xrun
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending frame number in X to include in operations
tooltip =
manpage = Starting and ending frame number in X to include in operations.  The
default is to include all frames in X.

[Field = YRunStartEnd]
short = yrun
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending frame number in Y to include in operations
tooltip =
manpage = Starting and ending frame number in Y to include in operations.  The
default is to include all frames in Y.

[Field = ZRun]
short = zrun
type = I
usage = Z value to perform operations on

manpage = Z value to perform operations on.  This entry is not needed if there
is only one section described in the info file. 

[Field = ThicknessToOutput]
short = thickness
type = I
usage = Thickness of output volume
tooltip =
manpage = Thickness to make output volume.  All frames will be transformed to
this thickness.  The default is the largest thickness of any input volume.

[Field = FindWarping]
short = find
type = B
usage = Run Findwarp on the warping vector fields from Stitchalign
tooltip =
manpage = Run Findwarp(1) on the warping vector fields from Stitchalign(1).
The default is to do all operations if no individual operations are selected
by -find, -warp, -stack, or -blend, but run only the specified operations if
any of these options are entered.

[Field = WarpVolumes]
short = warp
type = B
usage = Run Warpvol on the pieces
tooltip =
manpage =

[Field = StackVolumes]
short = stack
type = B
usage = Run Densmatch and Newstack on the pieces and produce piece list

[Field = VerboseOutput]
short = verbose
type = I
usage =  Level of verbose output (2 for all iterations in density matching)
tooltip =
manpage = Level of verbose output: 1 for command lines and some output in 
density matching, 2 for output of all iterations in density matching

[SectionHeader = WarpOptions]
usage = OPTIONS FOR RUNNING FINDWARP OR WARPVOL
manpage = Options for Running Findwarp or Warpvol

[Field = TargetMeanResidual]
short = target
type = FA
usage = Target mean residuals to achieve in Findwarp (default 0.1,0.2,0.3)
tooltip = 
manpage = One or more mean residual values to try to reach when Findwarp(1)
searches for the best warping.  Multiple values should be entered in increasing
order.  Findwarp(1) will try to find a warping with the largest number of
included patches that gives a mean residual below the first value; then it
tries again with the second value, etc.

[Field = MeasuredRatioMinAndMax]
short = measured
type = FP
usage = Min and max ratio of measurements to unknowns for fits in Findwarp
tooltip = 
manpage = The minimum and maximum ratio of measurements to unknowns to be
allowed in the fits in Findwarp(1).  The defaults are 4 and 12, divided by the
cube of the vector spacing factor used when running Stitchalign(1).  The
actual value used will be reported by the program.

[Field = DiscountIfZeroVectors]
short = discount
type = F
usage = Do not count local fits with more than this fraction of vectors zero
tooltip = 
manpage = This option is supplied to Findwarp(1) with a default value of 0.5
to prevent misleading averages when analyzing the warping fields, which
contain mostly zero vectors.  Fits with the number of zero vectors bigger than
the given fraction of the total vectors will be excluded from the averages.

[Field = TemporaryDirectory]
short = tempdir
long = TemporaryDirectory
type = CH
usage = Directory to use for temporary files in Warpvol
tooltip =

default is that the temporary files will be placed in the current directory.

[SectionHeader = StackOptions]
usage = OPTIONS FOR DENSITY MATCHING WHEN STACKING
manpage = Options for Density Matching when Stacking
[Field = DensityReferenceFrame]
short = density
type = IPM
usage = Frame number in X and Y of reference volume for density matching
tooltip =
manpage = Frame number in X and Y (numbered from one) of the volume to serve as
reference for density matching.  The default is to use the first one.

[Field = MatchingWidthXandY]
short = match
type = IP
usage = Width of overlap zone in X and Y to use for density matching
tooltip = 
manpage = Width of overlap zone in X and Y to use to determine the scaling for
density matching.  The program will run Densmatch(1) on the overlap zones
to find a relative scaling between each
pair of overlapping volumes, then resolve these scalings into a single scaling
for each volume.  The default is to use the central 30% of the width of the
overlap zone.  Enter a width of 0,0 to use the original
kind of density matching, which is a scaling based on matching the density in
the interior of each volume to that of the reference volume.

[Field = MatchingLengthXandY]
short = length
type = IP
usage = Length of overlap zone in X and Y to use for density matching
tooltip = 
manpage = Length of overlap zone in X and Y to use to determine the scaling for
density matching.  The default is to use the central 70% of the length of an
overlap zone; smaller values might be needed if pieces are severely skewed and
have gray area along a large fraction of the length of the overlap zones.  The
X and Y lengths are used for the overlaps between pieces in Y and X,
respectively.  Enter 0 for one of the values to use the default.

[SectionHeader = BLOptions]
usage = OPTIONS FOR RUNNING BLENDMONT
manpage = Options for Running Blendmont
[Field = StartingAndEndingX]
short = xminmax
type = IP
usage = Minimum and maximum X index coordinates to output in Blendmont

(numbered from 0).  The default is to output the entire image.

[Field = StartingAndEndingY]
short = yminmax
type = IP
usage = Minimum and maximum Y index coordinates to output in Blendmont
tooltip = 
manpage = Minimum and maximum Y index coordinates to output in Blendmont.

[Field = BinByFactor]
short = bin
long = BinByFactor
type = I
usage = Use binning to reduce blended images in size by the given factor
tooltip = 
manpage = Use binning to reduce blended images in size by the given factor.
Binning is applied to the data just before output, so the starting and ending
X and Y coordinates to output should be specified in unbinned pixels.

[Field = OldEdgeFunctions]
short = oldedge
type = B
usage = Use existing edge functions in blendmont
tooltip = 
manpage = Use existing edge functions, if they exist, rather than computing new
ones in Blendmont(1).

[Field = GoodEdgeLowAndHighZ]
short = goodedge
type = IP
usage = Default lower and upper Z limits for where edge functions are good
tooltip = 
manpage = Default lower and upper Z limits for where edge functions in
Blendmont(1) are good.  Beyond these limits, the edge functions will be taken
from the last good Z value.  If this option is entered, these limits will
applied to all edges except ones that have Z limit entries in the info file.
Unlike in Blendmont(1), these Z values are numbered from 1 for convenience.

[Field = OneGoodEdgeLimits]
short = onegood
type = IAM
usage = Specification of an edge and Z limits within which its edge functions 
are good
tooltip = 
manpage = This options specifies lower and upper Z limits for a specific edge;
beyond these limits the edge functions will be taken from the last good Z
value.  Five values are expected: number of frame below the edge in X and Y,
1 for an edge in X or 2 for an edge in Y, lower and upper Z
limits.  Note that the frame numbers are the fixed numbers in the supermontage
(numbered from 1), not the frame numbers within the blend, which might be
lower if a subset of frames is being blended.  Also note that unlike in
Blendmont(1), the Z values are numbered from 1.

[Field = ExcludeFillFromEdges]
short = exclude
type = B
usage = Exclude areas filled with constant values from edge functions
tooltip = 
manpage = With option, Blendmont(1) will detect image areas near an
overlap zone that consist of uniform values and exclude these areas when
computing the edge function.  In addition, in areas along an edge where one
piece consists of uniform values and the other has actual image data, it will
use the actual data across the whole edge instead of transitioning to the
uniform data.  This option is helpful when stitching a pair of volumes that do
not line up well vertically or horizontally, but it can produce artifacts with
supermontages that are laid out more regularly.

[Field = BlendingWidthXandY]
short = width
type = IP
usage = Width in X and Y across which to blend overlaps in Blendmont
tooltip = 
manpage = Width in X and Y across which to blend overlaps in Blendmont(1).  
The default is:
^  80% of the overlap zone width for overlap width less than 63,
^  50 pixels for overlap width between 63 and 100, or
^  50% of the overlap width for overlap width greater than 100.
^You will probably need to set a width smaller than the default if you made 
extra-large tomograms to avoid losing good regions from the
rotation of the tilt axis to vertical, and you did not trim the size back in
the warped volumes that are being blended.

[Field = BoxSizeShortAndLong]
short = boxsize
type = IP
usage = Size of box for finding edge functions in short and long directions
tooltip = 
manpage = Size of box for finding edge functions in short and long directions
in Blendmont(1).  The short direction is across an overlap zone, the long
direction is along it.  The default size is 10 pixels in the short direction
for frame sizes up to 1024 pixels, increasing proportional to the maximum
dimension of the frame above 1024.  The default in the long direction is 1.5
times the size in the short direction.
