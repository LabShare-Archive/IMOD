[Field = InputImageFile]
short = image
type = FN
usage = Input image file
tooltip = 
manpage = Input file with volume to be extracted from.  If this
option is not entered, the first non-option argument will be used for this
input file.

[Field = ModelFile]
short = model
type = FN
usage =	 Name of model file with points to be extracted
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of model file with points to be extracted.  If this option
is not entered, the second non-option argument will be used for this input
file.

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output file for single stack of all extracted subvolumes
tooltip = 
manpage = Output file for single stack of all extracted subvolumes.  If this
option is not entered, the third non-option argument will be used for this
output file.  Either an output file or a root name for a series of files must
be entered.

[Field = SeriesRootName]
short = series
type = CH
usage = Root name to use for series of numbered files
tooltip = 
manpage = Root name to use for series of numbered files, one per point being
extracted.  A dot and the number
will be appended to the root name for each file.  The number of digits used
for the number will be the same for all files so that they will list in order.

[Field = PieceListFile]
short = piece
type = FN
usage = Name of input piece list file if image is montaged or out of sequence
tooltip =
manpage =  

[Field = ArrayPieceList]
short = array
type = FN
usage = Name of piece list file for viewing extracted volumes in an array
tooltip =
manpage =  

[Field = TruePieceList]
short = true
type = FN
usage = Name of piece list file for viewing subvolumes in original positions
tooltip =
manpage =  

[Field = ObjectsToUse]
short = objects
type = LI
usage = List of model objects with points to extract
tooltip = 
manpage = List of model objects with points to extract (comma-separated ranges
allowed).  The default is to use all open contour or scattered point objects.
This option can be used to select a subset of objects in the model or force
the use of a closed contour object.

[Field = BoxSizeXY]
short = box
type = I
usage = Size of square box to extract in X/Y plane
tooltip = 
manpage = Size of square box to extract in X/Y plane.  If you want to extract
a rectangular box, use the -volume option instead.  Either -box or -volume
must be entered.

[Field = VolumeSizeXYZ]
short = volume
type = IT
usage = Size of subvolume to extract in X, Y, and Z
tooltip = 
manpage = Size of subvolume to extract in X, Y, and Z.  The Z entry is
irrelevant if -slices is entered as well.

[Field = SlicesBelowAndAbove]
short = slices
type = IP
usage = Number of slices to extract below and above points in Z
tooltip = 
manpage = Number of slices to extract below and above points in Z.  If this
option is not entered, the Z size is taken from the size entered with -box
(thus giving a cube), or from the Z size entered with -volume.
In these cases, the program extracts an equal number of slices below and above
for an odd Z size, and one more slice below than above for an even Z size.

[Field = WhichPointsToExtract]
short = which
type = I
usage = Which points to extract: 0 for start, 1 for end, -1 for all
tooltip = 
manpage = Which points to extract from each contour: 0 for starting points, 
1 for ending points, or -1 for all points.  The default is -1.

[Field = XMinAndMax]
short = xminmax
type = IP
usage = Minimum and maximum coordinates in X for points to extract
tooltip = 
manpage = Minimum and maximum coordinates in X for points to extract.  The
default is to extract for any point contained within the full volume and to
fill areas outside the volume with the mean intensity.

[Field = YMinAndMax]
short = yminmax
type = IP
usage = Minimum and maximum coordinates in Y for points to extract
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = ZMinAndMax]
short = zminmax
type = IP
usage = Minimum and maximum sections (numbered from 0) for volumes to extract
tooltip = 
manpage = Minimum and maximum sections within which volumes must be contained
in order to be extracted.  The default is to extract a volume for any point
contained within the full volume, which will lead to blank slices for points
vey near the top or bottom of the volume.  If this limit is set, the whole
extracted volume, not just the center point, must be contained with in the
limits.  Sections are numbered from 0.

[Field = XformsToApply]
short = xforms
type = FN
usage = File of transforms to apply to points before extracting
tooltip =
manpage = File of transforms to apply to points before extracting.  The first
transform in the file should correspond to the first section in the file.

[Field = BackTransform]
short = back
type = B
usage = Back-transform the points with the inverse of those transforms
tooltip =
manpage = Back-transform the points with the inverse of the transforms 
entered with -xforms.  These options could be used to take coordinates from an
aligned model and extract images from unaligned images.

[Field = TaperAtFill]
short = taper
type = IP
usage = Distance to taper incomplete box, and 0/1 for tapering outside/inside
tooltip = 
manpage = Use this option to taper the image in boxes that fall partially
outside the input volume.  Enter the number of pixels over which to taper the
image, and a 0 for tapering outside or 1 for tapering inside the border of the
real image data.  Tapering is to the mean of the input image file.  Boxes will
be tapered in Z as well as in X and Y.

[Field = BlankBetweenImages]
short = blank
type = I
usage = Pixels of blank space between images in array piece list (default 5)
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.

[Field = usage]
short = help
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage =
