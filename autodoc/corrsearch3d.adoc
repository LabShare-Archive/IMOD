type = FT
usage = Overall displacement of volume B relative to A in X, Y, and Z
tooltip = 
manpage = Overall displacement of the volume being aligned relative to the
reference volume in X, Y, and Z;
namely, the amount to add to a pixel coordinate in the reference volume to
obtain the coordinate of the corresponding pixel in the file being aligned.
This shift is excluded from the shifts reported in the output file.  If no
volume shift is entered, it is set equal to half the difference in size
between the two volumes, if any.

add to the coordinate of a feature near the center of the reference volume to 
obtain the coordinate of the same feature in the file being aligned, after
accounting for any overall volume displacement entered with -volume.
This shift will be used to start the search and will be included in 
the shifts reported in the output file.

[Field = KernelSigma]
short = kernel

usage = Sigma in pixels for real-space smoothing with 3D Gaussian kernel
tooltip = 
manpage = Sigma for real-space smoothing with 3D Gaussian kernel (in pixels).
The smoothing is with a 3x3x3 or 5x5x5 kernel whose coefficients are

manpage = Size in pixels of the 3D Gaussian kernel used for real-space 
smoothing.  The size can be either 3 or 5.  The default is 3 for a kernel sigma
below 1.5 and 5 for larger sigmas since the filtering reaches a point of
diminishing returns at about this sigma with a size of 3.

tooltip = 
manpage = Set to 1 for debugging output, 2 to obtain a dummy patch output file 
to assess the positions of the patches, and 3 to do Fourier correlations at
all positions, plus direct correlation searches wherever possible.  In the 
latter case each line of the patch output file will have the results from the
Fourier correlation, followed by the results from direct correlation, ending
with a 3D distance between the two results.
