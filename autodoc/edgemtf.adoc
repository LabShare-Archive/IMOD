[Field = InputFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input file with images of edges
tooltip = 
manpage = Input file with images of edges.  If this option is not entered, the
first nonoption argument will be used for this entry.

[Field = RootNameOfOutput]
short = rootname
type = FN
usage = Root of names for output files
tooltip = 
manpage = Root of names for the output files.  If this option is not entered, the
second nonoption argument will be used for this entry. The complete output
file will be named with this root plus ".out"; MTF files for individual images
will be named with this root plus "-n.mtf", where n is the section number.

[Field = SectionsStartAndEnd]
short = sections
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending sections to analyze (numbered from 0)
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending sections to analyze (numbered from 0).  The
default is to do all sections in the input file.

[Field = NumberOfPoints]
short = points
type = I
usage = Number of averaged points to produce in MTF (default 20)
tooltip = 
manpage = Number of points to produce in the averaged MTF curve.  If the curve
appears irregular, reduce this value.  The default is 20.

[Field = SummingOfLines]
short = sum
type = I
usage = Number of lines to sum into each line for analysis 
tooltip = 
manpage = Number of lines to sum into each line for alignment and analysis.
The default depends on the indicated binning: 3, 2, 1 and 1 for binnings 1, 2,
3, and 4.  If data are particularly noisy, this number may need to be
increased.  However, if the angle of the edge is more than a few degrees, it
may be necessary to reduce this number to 1 to avoid blurring the edge by
summing without aligning lines.

[Field = AveragingForReference]
short = average
type = I
usage = Number of summed lines to average for first referenece
tooltip = 
manpage = Number of summed lines to average together to make the initial
reference for aligning other summed lines.  
The default depends on the indicated binning: 2, 2, 2 and 1 for binnings 1, 2,
3, and 4. 

[Field = NormalizationComponents]
short = components
type = I
usage = Number of Fourier components to average for normalizing curve
tooltip = 
manpage = Number of Fourier components near zero frequency to average together
to normalize the curve to start at 1.0 for zero frequency.
The default depends on the indicated binning: 4, 2, 2 and 1 for binnings 1, 2,
3, and 4. This number may need to be decreased if images are not very wide.  
If too many components are included, then the whole curve will be scaled too high,
and the first averaged MTF value might even exceed 1.

[Field = BinningOfImages]
short = binning
type = I
usage = Binning of the images, used to select the defaults for summing and normalization
tooltip = 
manpage = Binning of the images, used to select the defaults for summing and
normalization, as described above for the -sum, -average, and -components options.

[Field = LinesForReference]
short = lines
type = IA
usage = Y coordinate of middle line for first reference (one per section to do)
tooltip = 
manpage = Y coordinate of the middle line to use for making an initial
reference.  When the edge is very sharp, this entry allows you to specify a
place where the edge falls most strongly between two pixels.  The default is
to take the middle coordinate in Y.  If you use this option, you must enter a
value for each section that is being analyzed.

[Field = CrossingValue]
short = cross
type = F
usage = Report the frequency where MTF crosses this value (default 0.5)
tooltip = 
manpage = The program will report the frequency at which the MTF crosses below
a particular value.  This single number can be useful for comparing different
curves that have similar shapes.  The default is 0.5.

[Field = ZeroDerivative]
short = zero
type = I
usage = X coordinate beyond which to zero out the derivative
tooltip = 
manpage = X coordinate beyond which to zero out the derivative.  This option
was apparently helpful for images that had a gradient on the right side.

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.

[Field = usage]
short = help
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage =
