Pip = 1

[Field = RootName]
short = root
type = CH
usage = Rootname for info file, joined tomogram, and other files
tooltip =
manpage = Rootname for info file, joined tomogram, and other intermediate files.
If this option is not entered, the first non-option argument will be
taken as the root name.

[Field = UseSliceRange]
short = use
type = IPM
usage = Starting and ending slices to include from one tomogram (required for each)
tooltip =
manpage = Starting and ending slices to include from one tomogram.
This option must be entered for
each tomogram if it is entered at all.  If the option is not entered, the
second and following non-option arguments will be used for the entries.  Thus,
the program may be run as
^   finishjoin [options]  root_name  slice_range1  slice_range2

[Field = ReferenceTomogram]
short = ref
type = I
usage = Tomogram number to use as reference for alignment (numbered from 1)
tooltip =
manpage = Make the given tomogram be the reference for alignment, in which
case slices from it will not be transformed, and other tomograms will be
transformed into alignment with it.  By default, all tomograms will be
transformed into alignment to a position averaged over all tomograms with
similar orientations.

[Field = AngleRange]
short = angle
type = F
usage = Range of angles for tomograms used to compute the average rotation angle
tooltip =
manpage = Base the average alignment on tomograms whose rotation angles fall
within the given range of each other (default 50 degrees).  If a minority of
the tomograms are rotated by large angles like 90 or 180 degrees relative to
the rest, then they will be excluded when determining the average alignment.
This prevents all of the sections from being rotated to an intermediate
orientation.

[Field = SizeInXandY]
short = size
type = IP
usage = The dimensions of the joined tomogram in X and Y in unbinned pixels
tooltip =
manpage = Set the size of the output slices to X by Y pixels.  The default size will
be the maximum X size by the maximum Y size of the input tomograms.  Enter a
size in unbinned pixels if binning is being used.

[Field = OffsetInXandY]
short = offset
type = IP
usage = Offsets in X and Y from center of image to point that will be new center
tooltip =
manpage = Set the X and Y offsets for the output slices, in unbinned pixels if
binning is being used.  These follow the same sign convention as in
Newstack(1); namely, the numbers entered should be the offsets from the center
of the current image to the image point which is intended to end up in the
center of the output image.  A positive offset in X will thus shift the image
to the left.

[Field = TrialInterval]
short = trial
type = I
usage = Build trial joined file using slices at the given interval
tooltip =
manpage = Build a trial joined tomogram using only slices at the given interval.  The
first and last slice of each slice range will always be included.  The output
file will be named "rootname"_trial.join.

[Field = BinningForTrial]
short = binning
type = I
usage = Binning to apply to images in trial joined file
tooltip =
manpage = Bin images by the given value when building a trial joined tomogram.

[Field = LocalFits]
short = local
type = B
usage = Use local fits to 7 sections when running xftoxg
tooltip =
manpage = When running Xftoxg(1) on the primary alignment transforms, run the
program in its default mode, which does local fits to 7 adjacent sections.
This option may eliminate unwanted trends in data sets with many sections.
When it is not entered, Xftoxg(1) is run with "-nfit 0", which computes a
global alignment.  

[Field = TransformFile]
short = xform
type = FN
usage = Refine alignment with g transforms in the given file
tooltip =
manpage = Use the refinement transforms contained in the given file to compute
the transforms to apply to the tomograms.  The file should contain global
transforms as computed by Xfjointomo(1).

[Field = MaximumSizeOnly]
short = maxsize
type = B
usage = Just compute maximum size and offsets needed to contain transformed data
tooltip =
manpage = Just compute the maximum size and offsets needed to contain the transformed
images from all of the sections, given the current transformations.  No
image file will be created.

[Field = FillGaps]
short = gaps
type = B
usage = Fill gaps with blank slices for slice ranges out of bounds
tooltip =
manpage = Create blank slices when the slice ranges include values out of
bounds (below 1 or above the number of slices in the file).  This option can
be used to make the gap between two sections bigger than what would be
provided by simply stacking all the slices from each file.  Without this
option, values out of bounds are not allowed.

[Field = TestMode]
short = test
type = B
usage = Do not run anything that requires complete image files
tooltip =
manpage = Do not run anything that requires complete image files,
specifically, Newstack(1), and output a file with the Newstack input.
