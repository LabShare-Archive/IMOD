tooltip = 
manpage = The Z dimension only will be reduced with antialiased filtering
instead of with binning if a number between 2 and 6 is entered to specify the
filter type.  Use the "-shrink" option to Newstack(1) first to use antialiased
reduction in X and Y.  The filters are as in Newstack(1):
^    2: Blackman - fast but not as good at antialiasing as slower filters
^    3: Triangle - fast but smooths more than Blackman
^    4: Mitchell - good at antialiasing, smooths a bit
^    5: Lanczos 2 lobes - good at antialiasing, less smoothing than Mitchel
^    6: Lanczos 3 lobes - slower, even less smoothing but more risk of ringing

[Field = SpreadSlicesInZ]
short = spread
type = B
usage = Output slices in Z that sample the range in Z as much as possible
tooltip = 
manpage = Output slices in Z that sample, or are centered on, Z values as
close to the starting and ending input slices as possible.  This option can be
used only when doing antialiased reduction in Z.  By default, the first output
slice is centered on the middle of the first set of slices corresponding to
the binning in Z.  The bottom edge of this slice is the same as the bottom
edge of the first input slice and the Z origin is unchanged.  With this option,
the centering of the first slice may be moved down, and the Z origin will be
increased to adjust for this.

[Field = MemoryLimit]
short = memory
type = I
usage = Maximum size of working array in megabytes (default 1000)
tooltip = 
manpage = Maximum size of working array in megabytes.  The size of the array
determines whether data are read in and binned in chunks or as whole slices,
which is more efficient.  The default is 1000; the value cannot be bigger than
8000.
