automation.

[Field = dataset]
format=\fItilt_series_file\fR|\fIdataset_name
usage=Sets Dataset Name in the Setup Tomogram dialog during automation.
manpage=Sets Dataset Name in the Setup Tomogram dialog during automation.
The value can be a file containing a tilt series, or the name of a
dataset.  A dataset name is the root name of the tilt series file - the
extension (and the trailing "a" or "b" in the dual axis case) is removed.
The file must be in the local directory unless the \fB--dir\fR option is
used.

usage=During automation, exit after the Setup Tomogram dialog has
completed.

[Field = fg]
type=B
usage=Run eTomo in the foreground.
manpage=Causes eTomo to be run in the foreground rather then in the
background.  This is useful when running eTomo with automation from
a script because a script will not wait until a background command has

manpage=Send extra information to eTomo's \fB_err.log\fR.
^The optional parameter has the following meaning:
^   \fB-1\fR - limited output
^   \fB0\fR - no debug output
