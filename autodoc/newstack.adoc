[Field = InputFile]
short = input
type = FNM
usage = Input image file
tooltip = 
manpage = Input image file.  Input files may also be entered after all 
arguments on the command line, as long as an output file is the last name
on the command line.  Files entered with this option will be 
processed before files at the end of the command line, if any.

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FNM
usage = Output image file
tooltip = 
manpage = Output image file.  The last filename on the command line will
also be treated as an output file, following any specified by this option.

[Field = FileOfInputs]
short = fileinlist
type = FN
usage = Name of file with list of input files and sections to read
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of file with list of input files and sections to read.  The
format of the file is the number of input files on the first line, the first
file to read on the next line, the list of sections to read on
next line, next filename on next line, etc.  If this
option is used, no input filenames may be specified with the -input option
or following options on the command line.

[Field = FileOfOutputs]
short = fileoutlist
type = FN
usage = Name of file with list of output files and number of sections in each
tooltip = Name of file with list of output files and number of sections to 
place in each
manpage = Name of file with list of output files and number of sections to 
place in each.  The
format of the file is the number of output files on the first line, the first
file to write on the next line, number of sections to write on
next line, next filename on next line, etc.  If this
option is used, no output filenames may be specified with the -output option
or as the last file on the command line.

[Field = SplitStartingNumber]
short = split
type = I
usage = Starting number for series of numbered output files, one section each
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting number for a series of numbered output files, where
one section will be placed in each file.  There must be only one output file
name entered, and it will be taken as the root name for the output files.  A
dot and the number will be appended to the root name for each file unless an
extension is entered with the -append option.  The number of digits used for
the number will be the same for all files so that they will list in order. 

[Field = AppendExtension]
short = append
type = CH
usage = Extension to append to series of numbered filenames
tooltip =
manpage = Extension to append to the filenames in a series of numbered files.
With this option, files will be named like "rootnnn.ext" instead of
"root.nnn", where "root" is the root name entered as the output file name,
and "ext" is the extension entered with this option.

[Field = SectionsToRead]
short = secs
type = LIM
usage = List of sections to read from input file, numbered from 0.  
The default is all sections.  Ranges are allowed.
tooltip = 
manpage = List of sections to read from an input file, numbered from 0.
Ranges may be entered (e.g., 1-3,5,8), and / may be used to specify all
sections in the file.  If multiple lists are entered, each
one will be applied to the respective input file.  If no list is entered for
a file, all sections will be read.

[Field = SkipSectionIncrement]
short = skip
type = I
usage = Increment for reading regularly spaced subset of sections in the list
tooltip = 
manpage = Increment for reading a regularly spaced subset of the sections in
the list from the input file.  Enter 2 to take every other section, 3 to take
every third section, etc.  Note that the increment is used to select from
the input list, not from all the sections in the file.

[Field = NumberToOutput]
short = numout
type = IAM
usage = Number of sections to write to an output file
tooltip = 
manpage = Number of sections to write to each output file, when there are
multiple output files.  These numbers may be listed in sequence in one entry,
or in several entries.

[Field = ReplaceSections]
short = replace
type = LI
usage = List of sections to replace in existing output file, numbered from 0
tooltip = 
manpage = List of section numbers at which to write images into an existing 
output file.  There must be only a single output file, its size in X and Y
must be appropriate, and the given sections must already exist in the file.
The minimum and maximum density in the file header will be modified by the min
and max of the sections being written, so they can become more extreme but not
less extreme.  The mean density will not be changed.

[Field = BlankOutput]
short = blank
type = B
usage = Output blank sections for nonexistent section numbers in input file
tooltip = 
manpage = Output blank sections for nonexistent section numbers in input file,
namely for section numbers less than 0 or more than the NZ - 1.  The sections
are filled with the mean value of the input file or with a fill value if one
is entered with the -fill option; this value is then scaled in the same way
that actual data are.

[Field = SizeToOutputInXandY]
short = size
type = IP
usage = Size of output image in X and Y; default is size of first input 
file.
tooltip = 
manpage = The dimensions of the output image in X and Y.
The default size is the same as that of the first input file.

[Field = ModeToOutput]
short = mode
type = I
usage = Storage mode of output file; 0 for byte, 1 or 6 for integer, 2 for real
tooltip = 
manpage = The storage mode of the output file; 0 for byte, 1 for 16-bit 
signed integer, 6 for 16-bit unsigned integer, or 2 for 32-bit floating point.
The default is the mode of the first input file.

[Field = BytesSignedInOutput]
short = bytes
type = I
usage = Output bytes as signed (1) or unsigned (0) regardless of other settings
tooltip = 
manpage = This entry controls how bytes are stored in the output file and
overrides both the default for this version of IMOD and the setting of the
environment variable WRITE_MODE0_SIGNED.  Enter 0 for unsigned numbers
or 1 for signed numbers.  Unsigned output is needed to work with versions of IMOD
before IMOD 4.2.23; signed output may be needed for compatibility with
external software that has followed recent documentation of the MRC format.
Regardless of the representation in the file, bytes are read into IMOD programs as
unsigned with a range of 0 to 255.

[Field = StripExtraHeader]
short = strip
type = B
usage = Do not transfer extra header information from input to output
tooltip = 
manpage = Do not transfer extra header information in input file(s) to output
file(s).  The default is to transfer this information whenever possible.

[Field = OffsetsInXandY]
short = offset
type = FAM
usage = X and Y center offsets for each section, or one X,Y pair to apply to 
all sections
tooltip = 
manpage = X and Y center offsets for each section.  This is an offset to the
center of the area from which image will be taken, so a positive offset in X
will move images to the left.  If images are being binned, the entry should be
in unbinned pixels.  Enter one X,Y pair to apply a single offset to
all sections.

[Field = ApplyOffsetsFirst]
short = applyfirst
type = B
usage = Apply offsets in X and Y before transforming image (default is after)
tooltip = 
manpage = Apply offsets in X and Y before transforming image, which will make
a rotated image come from a predictable location.  The default is to apply
offsets after, which shifts the transformed image instead.

[Field = TransformFile]
short = xform
type = FN
usage = File with linear transformations to apply to images
tooltip = 
manpage = File with one or more linear transformations to apply to images

[Field = UseTransformLines]
short = uselines
type = LIM
usage = List of line numbers of transforms to apply, numbered from 0.
tooltip = 
manpage = A list of the line numbers of lines of transforms to use in the
transform file (numbered from 0).  Ranges are allowed.  The default is for the
line numbers to match the input section numbers.  To have a single
transform applied to all of the sections, just enter a single number.

[Field = OneTransformPerFile]
short = onexform
type = B
usage = Apply one transform line for each input file
tooltip = 
manpage = Apply one transform line for each input file.  The default is for
the first transform to be applied to the first file, the second transform to
the second file, etc., in which case the transform file must have at least one
line per input file.  Otherwise, -uselines can be used to specify which
transform to apply for each file, in which case at least one line must be
specified per input file.

[Field = RotateByAngle]
short = rotate
type = F
usage = Rotate all images by the given angle
tooltip = Rotate all images by the given angle in degrees, counterclockwise
positive.
manpage =  Rotate all images by the given angle in degrees, positive for a
counterclockwise rotation.  Rotation is applied after binning and 
transformation, if any.  It can be combined with
linear transforms but not with warping transforms.  If 
the rotation is by +90 or -90 degrees and no
output size
is specified, then the X and Y sizes of the image will be transposed so
the the output file will show the whole rotated image.  For any other rotation 
angles, you will get the same output size as the input image unless you
enter a new size explicitly.

[Field = ExpandByFactor]
short = expand
type = F
usage = Scale all images up in size by the given factor
tooltip =
manpage = Scale all images up in size by the given factor, greater than 1 to 
expand, or less than 1 to shrink with ordinary interpolation.  Scaling is
applied after binning and transformation, if any.  It can be combined with
linear transforms but not with warping transforms.  If no output size is
specified, the size of the input image will be scaled appropriately so that
the output will contain the entire image.

[Field = ShrinkByFactor]
short = shrink
type = F
usage = Scale all images down in size by the given factor with antialias filtering
tooltip =
manpage = Scale all images down in size by the given factor, a value
greater than 1, using antialias filtering.  This option should be used for
large image reductions, because using ordinary interpolation 
will give aliasing artifacts that appear primarily as noise.
Even binning will give some aliasing.  Shrinking can be applied after
binning but cannot be combined with rotation, general transformation, or
distortion correction.  If no output size is specified, the size of the input
image will be scaled appropriately so that the output will contain the entire
image.

[Field = AntialiasFilter]
short = antialias
type = I
usage = Type of antialiasing filter to use when shrinking images (default 5)
tooltip = 
manpage = Type of antialiasing filter to use when reducing images with the
-shrink option.  The available types of filters are:
^    1: Box - equivalent to binning
^    2: Blackman - fast but not as good at antialiasing as slower filters
^    3: Triangle - fast but smooths more than Blackman
^    4: Mitchell - good at antialiasing, smooths a bit
^    5: Lanczos 2 lobes - good at antialiasing, less smoothing than Mitchel
^    6: Lanczos 3 lobes - slower, even less smoothing but more risk of ringing
^The default is 5 for the Lanczos 2, which many people consider the best
compromise among the various factors.

[Field = BinByFactor]
short = bin
type = I
usage = Use binning to reduce images in size by the given factor
tooltip = 
manpage = Use binning to reduce images in size by the given factor.  Binning
is applied before all other image transformations.  If no output size is
specified, the size of the input image will be scaled appropriately so that
the output will contain the entire image.

[Field = AdjustOrigin]
short = origin
type = B
usage = Adjust the image origin for changes in image size and location
tooltip = 
manpage = Adjust the origin values in the image file header for changes in
image size or the centering of a subarea.  With this adjustment, a model
built on the input stack should be correctly located when loaded onto the
output stack in 3dmod(1).  Model points will be correctly located in Z
provided that a contiguous set of sections is output.  They will be correct
in X and Y provided that the only operations on the data are a change in size
of the output, binning with -bin, scaling with -expand, and shifting with
-offset.

[Field = LinearInterpolation]
short = linear
type = B
usage = Use linear instead of cubic interpolation to transform images
tooltip = 
manpage = Use linear instead of cubic interpolation to transform images.
Linear interpolation is more suitable when images are
very noisy, but cubic interpolation will preserve fine detail better when
noise is not an issue.  Images are
transformed when the -xform, -expand, -rotate, -distort, or -gradient
option is entered.

[Field = NearestNeighbor]
short = nearest
type = B
usage = Use nearest neighbor instead of cubic interpolation to transform images
tooltip = 
manpage = Use nearest neighbor interpolation instead of cubic interpolation to
transform images.  This method simply picks the nearest existing pixel
value instead of interpolating between surrounding values, so it can be used
when pixels have discrete or meaningful values that need to be preserved.
This option and -linear are mutually exclusive.   Images are transformed when
the -xform, -expand, -rotate, -distort, or -gradient option is entered.

[Field = FloatDensities]
short = float
type = I
usage = Rescale densities of sections separately to fill data range (1), to 
bring to common mean and SD (2), to shift to common mean (3), or to shift to
common mean and rescale (4)
tooltip = 
manpage = Adjust densities of sections individually.  Enter 1 for each section
to fill the data range, 2 to scale sections to common mean and standard
deviation, 3 to shift sections to a common mean without scaling, or 4 to
shift sections to a common mean then rescale the minimum and maximum densities
to the Min and Max values specified with the -scale option.

[Field = MeanAndStandardDeviation]
short = meansd
type = FP
usage = Scale all images to the given mean and standard deviation
tooltip = 
manpage = Scale all images to the given mean and standard deviation.  This
option implies -float 2 and is incompatible with all other scaling options.
There is no check that the scaling is sensible for the data mode, so be sure
to change data modes to prevent excessive truncation or loss of resolution.
For example, change from unsigned bytes to integers if setting the mean to 0
or the SD to a large number (> 50); change from bytes or integers to floating point
if setting the SD to a small number (< 10).

[Field = ContrastBlackWhite]
short = contrast
type = IP
usage = Rescale densities to match contrast in 3dmod with the
given black and white values
tooltip = 
manpage = Rescale densities to match the contrast seen in 3dmod(1) with the
given black and white values.  This works properly only when the output file
will be bytes.  It will not work if the data were loaded into
3dmod with intensity scaling; use mrcbyte(1) in that case.

[Field = ScaleMinAndMax]
short = scale
type = FP
usage = Apply one density scaling to all sections to map current min and max 
to the given Min and Max
tooltip = 
manpage = Rescale the densities of all sections by the same factors so that
the original minimum and maximum density will be mapped to the Min and Max
values that are entered.

[Field = MultiplyAndAdd]
short = multadd
type = FPM
usage = Scale all sections by multiplying by first value then adding the second
tooltip = 
manpage = Rescale the densities of all sections by multiplying by the first
entered value then adding the second value.  This option must be entered either
once only, or once per input file.

[Field = FillValue]
short = fill
type = F
usage = Value to fill empty image areas with, before scaling
tooltip = 
manpage = Value to fill areas of the output image that have no image data.
The filling is done before intensity scaling, so the value in the filled areas
will be modified by any scaling that is done.

[Field = TaperAtFill]
short = taper
type = IP
usage = Distance to taper at fill border or 1 for default, and 0/1 for 
tapering outside/inside
tooltip = 
manpage = To taper an output image at a border between
real image and a filled area, just as is done with Mrctaper(1), enter this
option with two values: 1) the distance over which to taper or 1 for a default
distance, and 2) a 0 for tapering outside or 1 for tapering
inside the border.  The default distance is 1%
of the mean of the X and Y sizes of the output image, but at least 16
pixels and no more than 127.  The
program will exit with an error if there is not enough memory to hold the
entire output image.

[Field = DistortionField]
short = distort
type = FN
usage = Image distortion field file to use for undistorting images
tooltip = 
manpage = Image distortion field file to use for undistorting images.  The 
undistortion is applied before any transformations.

[Field = ImagesAreBinned]
short = imagebinned
type = I
usage = The current binning of the images
tooltip = 
manpage = The current binning of the images, so that the distortion field can
be applied correctly.  This entry is required unless
the program can determine the binning unambiguously from the image size.

[Field = UseFields]
short = fields
type = LIM
usage = List of distortion fields to apply, numbered from 0.
tooltip = 
manpage = A list of the distortion fields to apply for each section (numbered
from 0).  Ranges are allowed.  The default is for the field numbers to match
the input section numbers, unless there is only one field in the file.  To
have a single field applied to all of the sections, just enter a single
number.  This option was added when the only way to warp images was with
distortion field files but it is not needed with current warping files.

[Field = GradientFile]
short  = gradient
type = FN
usage = File with magnification gradients to be applied for each image
tooltip = 
manpage = File with magnification gradients to be applied for each image.
This should be a file listing the tilt angle, the percent magnification change
per micron of Z height, and the degrees of rotation per micron of Z height
for each image, such as is produced by Extractmaggrad.  The mag gradient
correction is applied before a distortion field correction and before any
transformations.

[Field = MemoryLimit]
short = memory
type = I
usage = Total size of working array to allocate, in megabytes
tooltip = 
manpage = Use this entry to specify the amount of memory used by the program
for its main array, in megabytes.  By default, the program will try to use
enough memory to hold both an input image and an output image in floating
point form (4 bytes per pixel), up to 15 GB.  Limiting the memory can keep it
from using more memory than available but may result in it operating on the
images in chunks.  Entering a value larger than 15000 will allow it to use more
memory than the default.  The main array is used to hold both the input image
(in whole or in part) and a transformed image (in whole or in part).

[Field = TestLimits]
short = test
type = IP
usage = Total size of working array, and size of binning array
tooltip = 
manpage = To test the code for reading in and binning images in chunks,
enter limits for the total size of the working array, and for the size of 
the array used for binning.  The sizes are the number of 4-byte elements.

[Field = VerboseOutput]
short = verbose
type = I
usage = 1 for diagnostic output
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.

[Field = usage]
short = help
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage =
