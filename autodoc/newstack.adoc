manpage = Input image file.  Input files may also be entered after all 
arguments on the command line, as long as an output file is the last name
on the command line.  Files entered with this option will be 
processed before files at the end of the command line, if any.

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
long = OutputFile
type = FNM
usage = Output image file

manpage = Output image file.  The last filename on the command line will
also be treated as an output file, following any specified by this option.

[Field = ListOfInputs]
short = listin
long = ListOfInputs
type = FN
usage = Name of file with list of input files and sections to read
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of file with list of input files and sections to read.  The
format of the file is filename on first line, list of sections to read on
next line, next filename on next line, etc.  If this
option is used, no input filenames may be specified with the -input option
or following options on the command line.

usage = Name of file with list of output files and number of sections in each
tooltip = Name of file with list of output files and number of sections to 
place in each
manpage = Name of file with list of output files and number of sections to 
place in each.  The
format of the file is filename on first line, number of sections to write on
next line, next filename on next line, etc.  If this
option is used, no output filenames may be specified with the -output option
or as the last file on the command line.

type = LIM
usage = List of sections to read from input file, numbered from 0.  
The default is all sections.  Ranges are allowed.
tooltip = 
manpage = List of sections to read from an input file, numbered from 0.
Ranges may be entered (e.g., 1-3,5,8), and / may be used to specify all
sections in the file.  If multiple lists are entered, each
one will be applied to the respective input file.  If no list is entered for
a file, all sections will be read.

short = numout
long = NumberToOutput
type = IAM
usage = Number of sections to write to an output file
tooltip =
