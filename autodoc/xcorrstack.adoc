[Field = StackInputFile]
short = stack
type = FN
usage = Input file with stack of images to correlate with a single image
tooltip = 
manpage = Input file with stack of images to correlate with a single image. If
this option is not entered, the first non-option argument will be used for
this input file.

[Field = SingleInputFile]
short = single
type = FN
usage = Input file with single image to correlate with the stack of images
tooltip = 
manpage = Input file with single image to correlate with the stack of images.
If this option is not entered, the second non-option argument will be used for
this input file.

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output file for correlation images
tooltip = 
manpage = Output file for correlation images.  If this option is not entered,
the third non-option argument will be used for this output file.

[Field = StartingEndingSections]
short = sections
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending sections to correlate (numbered from 0)
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending sections in the input stack to correlate with
the single image.  Sections are numbered from 0.  The Z origin of the output
file will be adjusted so that a model generated on the input stack will
display correctly on the correlation stack.

[Field = FilterRadius1]
short = rad1
type = F
usage = Left cutoff radius for filter
tooltip = 
manpage = Low spatial frequencies in the cross-correlation will be attenuated
by a Gaussian curve that is 1 at this cutoff radius and falls off below this
radius with a standard deviation specified by FilterSigma2.  Spatial
frequency units range from 0 to 0.5.  Use FilterSigma1 instead of this entry
for more predictable attenuation of low frequencies.

[Field = FilterRadius2]
short = rad2
type = F
usage = Right cutoff radius for filter
tooltip = High frequency cutoff radius for Gaussian filter
manpage = High spatial frequencies in the cross-correlation will be attenuated
by a Gaussian curve that is 1 at this cutoff radius and falls off above this
radius with a standard deviation specified by FilterSigma2.

[Field = FilterSigma1]
short = sig1
type = F
usage = Sigma for low-frequency inverted Gaussian filter
tooltip = 
manpage = Sigma value to filter low frequencies in the correlations with a
curve that is an inverted Gaussian.  This filter is 0 at 0 frequency and decays
up to 1 with the given sigma value.  However, if a negative value of radius1
is entered, this filter will be zero from 0 to |radius1| then decay up to 1.

[Field = FilterSigma2]
short = sig2
type = F
usage = Sigma for Gaussian rolloff below radius1 and above radius2
tooltip = Sigma for Gaussian rolloff below low frequency cutoff and above 
high frequency cutoff
manpage = Sigma value for the Gaussian rolloff below and above the cutoff
frequencies specified by FilterRadius1 and FilterRadius2

[Field = ModeOfOutput]
short = mode
type = I
usage = Mode for correlation images (default same as input)
tooltip = 
manpage = Mode for correlation images: 0 for byte, 1 for short integer, 2 for
floating point, 6 for unsigned short integer.  Except for floating point
output, each correlation image will be scaled to fill the positive dynamic
range of the mode.  The default is the same mode as the input.

[Field = SplitIntoCorners]
short = split
type = B
usage = Split a single image into 4 corners even if same size as stack
tooltip = 
manpage = If the single image is the same size as the input stack, this option
can be used to the middle shifted to the lower left corner, just as occurs for
smaller single images.

[Field = FillValue]
short = fill
type = F
usage = Value to fill when embedding image into a larger array
tooltip = 
manpage = Value to fill when embedding image into a larger array.  The default
is to fill with the mean at the edge of the image.

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.

[Field = usage]
short = help
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage =
