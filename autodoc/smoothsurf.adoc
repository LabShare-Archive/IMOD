[Field = InputFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input model file
tooltip = 
manpage = Input model file. 

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output model file
tooltip = 
manpage = Output model file. 

[Field = ObjectsToSmooth]
short = objects
type = LI
usage = List of objects to smooth (default is to do all objects)
tooltip = 
manpage = A list of the objects to smooth (ranges are allowed, e.g. 1,2,5-7).
The default is to do all closed-contour objects, and open contours that lie in
one plane.

[Field = NumberOfSections]
short = nz
type = I
usage = Number of sections in Z over which to fit surfaces (default 7)
tooltip = 
manpage = Number of sections or slices in Z to include in the fit.  Higher
numbers smooth more.  The default is 7.

[Field = MaximumDistance]
short = distance
type = F
usage = Maximum distance for points included in fits (default 15)
tooltip = 
manpage = Maximum distance from the central point being smoothed, for points
to be included in fits.  Higher distances smooth more.  The default is 15
pixels.

[Field = ContourOrder]
short = contorder
type = I
usage = Polynomial order for smoothing contours, or 0 for none (default 2)
tooltip = 
manpage = Order of the polynomials fit to contours to smooth them after 
smoothing the surface, or 0 to omit this smoothing.
Higher orders smooth less.  The default is order 2; order 1 (linear) 
will probably oversmooth and contract the contours.

[Field = SurfaceOrder]
short = surforder
type = I
usage = Polynomial order for surface fit to points in 3D (default 3)
tooltip = 
manpage = Order of the polynomials fit to the surface.  Higher orders smooth
less.  The default is order 3.  Note that a second-order polynomial has 5
terms and a third-order has 9 terms.

[Field = SortSurfaces]
short = sort
type = I
usage = Analyze mesh to sort contours into surfaces (1), use existing surface
data (-1), or do neither (0) (default 1)
tooltip = 
manpage = This option controls whether the program uses surface assignments of
contours to keep from including points from contours that belong to different
surfaces in a surface fit.  With the default value of 1, the program will
analyze the object mesh, if any, to sort contours into surfaces (see
ImodSortSurf(1)).  Enter -1 to have the program use existing surface values of
the contours, or 0 to ignore surface information.

[Field = usage]
short = help
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage = Print help output.
