[Field = InputFile]
short = in
type = FN
usage = Input model filename
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of input model file.  If it is not entered with this option it 
must be entered with the first non-option argument.

[Field = OutputFile]
type = FN
usage = Output model filename
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of output model file.  If it is not entered with this option it 
must be entered with the second non-option argument.


[Field = WindowLength]
short = wl
type = FP
usage = Window length over which to fit circle
tooltip = 
manpage = Length in pixels over which to fit a circle to the contour data
around a point.  The default is the mean of the lower and upper radius
criteria.

[Field = ZRangeToFit]
short = zr
type = F
usage = Range of contours in Z to include for fitting to a sphere
tooltip = 
manpage = Range of contours in Z to include for fitting to a sphere.  The
value should specify the actual distance in Z after Z-scaling, if any.
The default is 0 to fit just one contour at a time to a circle.

[Field = RadiusCriterion]
short = rc
type = FP
usage = Lower and upper criteria for radius of curvature
tooltip = 
manpage = Lower and upper criteria for radius of curvature.  When the radius
at a point is within this range, it will be encoded into the model.

[Field = FitCriterion]
short = fc
type = F
usage = Criterion for RMS error of circle fit (default 0)
tooltip = 
manpage = Criterion for root mean squared error of the local fit to a circle.
If a non-zero value is entered, then the RMS error must be less than the given
value for a radius of curvature to be encoded at that point.  With the default
value of 0, the curvature will be encoded regardless of the error of the fit.

[Field = ObjectsToDo]
short = ob
type = LI
usage = List of objects to encode
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = PointSize]
short = ps
type = B
usage = Use spherical point size to encode radius of curvature
tooltip = 
manpage = Use spherical point size to encode radius of curvature.  Each point 
that meets
the criterion will be given a point size equal to the radius of curvature;
other points will have individual point sizes set to 0.

[Field = SymbolZoom]
short = sy
type = F
usage = Use circular symbols to encode radius with given zoom factor
tooltip = 
manpage = Use circular symbols to encode radius of curvature, where the
circles will have the right size when the image is displayed with the given
zoom factor.

[Field = Color]
short = co
type = ITM
usage = Color to set for points meeting criteria (r,g,b between 0 and 255)
tooltip = 
manpage = Use this entry to specify one or more colors to change points to
when their radius of curvature meets the criteria.  Enter r,g,b values
between 0 and 255.  When multiple colors are entered, the behavior is
controlled by the -di option.  

[Field = DivideRange]
short = di
type = B
usage = Subdivide radius range to use all colors entered
tooltip = 
manpage = When multiple colors are entered, by default they will be
applied to successive objects being analyzed.  If this option is
entered, then the range of radii between the low and high criterion will be
subdivided by the number of colors, and points within each subrange will be
assigned to a different color.

[Field = UsePalette]
short = pa
type = B
usage = Use 256-color false color palette for colors and subdivide
tooltip = 
manpage = Use the 256-color false color palette from 3dmod for the colors.
This option will automatically subdivide the radius range into 256 levels.

[Field = SampleSpacing]
short = sa
type = F
usage = Spacing of sample points along contour for fitting (default 2)
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = Verbose]
short = ve
type = B
usage = Verbose output for testing or seeing mean errors
tooltip = 
manpage = The verbose output will show the number of points being fit, the
center and radius, and the root mean squared error for each point being fit.
It could be useful for getting a sense of the RMS errors.

[Field = TestCircleFits]
short = tc
type = B
usage = Test circle fitting
tooltip = 
manpage = Test circle fitting by fitting a circle to each contour in object 1
and putting a point with the given location and radius in a new object.

[Field = TestSphereFits]
short = ts
type = IP
usage = Test sphere fits at given contour and point #
tooltip = 
manpage = Test sphere fitting by making a new object with the points being
fit to and the fitted sphere for the given contour and point number.
