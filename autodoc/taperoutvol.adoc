0.  The default is the whole depth in Z.

[Field = TaperPadsInXYZ]
short = taper
type = IT
usage = Number of pixels over which to taper the patches in X, Y and Z
tooltip = 
manpage = Number of pixels over which to taper and pad the patches in X, Y and
Z.  The default is 0.  Unless the -nofft option is entered, the amount of
tapering in any dimension may be increased to make that dimension suitable for
taking an FFT.

[Field = NoFFTSizes]
short = nofft
type = B
usage = Do not adjust the padding to give sizes suitable for an FFT
