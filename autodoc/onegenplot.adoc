[Field = InputDataFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Name of data file
tooltip =
manpage = Name of file with data to plot.  If this option is not entered, the
first non-option argument is used for the name.

[Field = NumberOfColumns]
short = ncol
type = I
usage = # of columns of data, 0 if # is before data, or -1 if data all on one line
tooltip =
manpage = The number of columns of data per item in the file, or 0 if the
number is in the file on a line just before the data, or -1 if all the entries
for a data item are on one line, so that the number can be determined
automatically.  The default is -1.

[Field = SkipLinesAtStart]
short = skip
type = I
usage = Number of lines to skip at start at file
tooltip =
manpage = Number of lines to skip at the beginning of the data file.  If this
option is not entered, the program will attempt to determine the number of
lines to be ignored automatically.  This should work provided that any one of
these conditions is the case:
^  1) the extra lines always start with non-numeric text; 
^  2) the number of numeric values at the beginning of extra lines is fewer
than the number of columns entered with -ncol (minus 1 if -types is entered
too); 
^  3) extra lines start with a non-integer if -ncol is entered as 0;
^  4) extra lines start with only one number if -types is entered.

[Field = ColumnsToPlot]
short = columns
type = IA
usage = Numbers of columns to plot, numbered from 1
tooltip =
manpage = Numbers of the columns to plot, numbered from 1.  If more than one
number is entered and -ordinals is not entered, the first number
specifies the column to use for the X axis; otherwise
all numbers specify columns to plot on the Y axis.  If there are
no data types, multiple columns can be given for the Y axis; if there are data
types, only one column can be listed for Y.  If this option is not entered, the
default is 1 and 2, unless there is only one data column or -ordinals is
entered, in which case the default is 1.

[Field = TypesToPlot]
short = types
type = IA
usage = One or more data types to plot
tooltip =
manpage = One or more data types to plot; types are not numbered from one but
correspond to the arbitrary type values in the data file.  With this entry,
the first column of numbers in the file will be read as type values, and the
column after that will become the first column of data.  If there are type
numbers in the file and this entry is not given, the type numbers will end up
in the first column of data.

[Field = SymbolsForTypes]
short = symbols
type = IA
usage = One or more symbols to use for the different types or columns
tooltip =
manpage = One or more symbols to use for the different types or columns being
plotted.  Available symbol numbers are:
^  1, 2: Open and filled squares
^  3, 4: Open and filled diamonds
^  5, 6: Open and filled triangles
^  7, 8: X and +
^  9, 10: Open and filled circles
^  11, 12: Open and filled inverted triangles
^  13, 14: U and S
^  15: Open circle with vertical line
^  18: Small dot
^  19: Horizontal line
^  0: No symbol, points are automatically connected with lines
^  -1: Draw item number at each data point
^ If no, or not enough, symbol values are entered, the program will assign
symbols in order from this list: 9, 7, 5, 8, 13, 14, 1, 11, 3, 10, 6, 2, 12,
4, excluding any that have already been specified.

[Field = ConnectWithLines]
short = connect
type = B
usage = Draw lines between successive points within a type or column
tooltip =
manpage = Draw lines between successive points within a type or column; this
entry is not needed if the symbol is 0

[Field = OrdinalsForXvalues]
short = ordinal
type = B
usage = Plot data within each column or type sequentially in X
tooltip =
manpage = Plot data within each column or type sequentially in X, i.e., versus
a set up numbers that start from 1 and increase by 1 for each value plotted.
This entry is implied if only one column is entered.

[Field = XLogOrRootAndBase]
short = xlog
type = FP
usage = 1 to take log or 2 to take square root of X values, and base to add
tooltip =
manpage = 1 to take the logarithm or 2 to take the square root of X values,
and the base to add before that operation.  A base is needed to avoid taking
the logarithm or quare root of negative numbers.  An appropriate base value
can also be helpful for spreading out the data more evenly.  The numeric axis
labels on the graph will be in the units of the data after the operation,
e.g., in log units, not in original units.

[Field = YLogOrRootAndBase]
short = ylog
type = FP
usage = 1 to take log or 2 to take square root of Y values, and base to add
tooltip =
manpage = 1 to take the logarithm or 2 to take the square root of Y values,
and the base to add before that operation.

[Field = HueOfGroup]
short = hue
type = CHM
usage = Group number and color name or red, green, blue (0-255)
tooltip =
manpage = This option can be used to specify a color for each group being
plotted.  Groups are numbered from 1 and correspond to the types or columns
being plotted in separate curves.  Enter either 4 integers separated by commas 
(the group number and the red, green, and blue values, ranging from 0 to 255)
or the group number and a stock color name separated by a comma.  Groups
without a color will be drawn in black.

[Field = StockColorList]
short = stock
type = B
usage = List standard colors available by name
tooltip =
manpage = List standard colors available by name in the -hue option.  These
are a subset of standard HTML color names and values.

[Field = XaxisLabel]
short = axis
type = CH
usage = Label for the X axis
tooltip =
manpage = 

[Field = KeyLabels]
short = keys
type = CHM
usage = Text to display on right side of window after a type's or column's symbol
tooltip =
manpage = Text to display as a key for one type or column, shown along with
that type's or column's symbol, if any, on the right side of the window.  Text
is drawn in a large box with word wrapping enabled, so the key can be longer
than the space on the right of the graph.  The program will show default keys
with the column or type number if not enough labels are entered.

[Field = MessageBoxLine]
short = message
type = CHM
usage = One line of a message to be displayed in a message box
tooltip =
manpage = 

[Field = ToolTipLine]
short = tooltip
type = CHM
usage = One line of tooltip for the graphics window
tooltip =
manpage = 

[Field = RemoveDataFile]
short = remove
type = B
usage = Delete input file when exiting
tooltip =
manpage = Delete input file when exiting.  This option is meant to be used
only when running in the background, as cleanup will not occur if the program
is interrupted with Ctrl-C.
