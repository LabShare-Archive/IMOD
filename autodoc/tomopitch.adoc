[Field = ModelFile]
short = model
type = FNM
usage = Model file with lines to analyze
tooltip = 
manpage = Model file with lines to analyze.  If there are multiple model
file entries, they should be in order that they will be considered in the 
program.

[Field = ExtraThickness]
short = extra
type = F
usage = Additional pixels of thickness to add on top and bottom
tooltip = 
manpage = Additional pixels of thickness to add to both the top and the bottom 
of the tomogram, beyond the region described by the model lines.  Enter values
as unbinned pixels, i.e. pixels after the scaling factor has been applied.

[Field = SpacingInY]
short = spacing
type = F
usage = Spacing between tomogram samples (distance in Y in tilted views)
tooltip =
manpage = Spacing between tomogram samples (distance in Y in tilted views).
If a non-zero number is entered, the program will
compute the tilt around the X-axis that will make the tomogram be
flat in its Z dimension. 

[Field = ScaleFactor]
short = scale
type = F
usage = Amount to scale the recommended Z shift and thickness (for binned-down
samples)
tooltip =
manpage = Amount by which to scale the Z shift and thickness recommended by
the program.  Use this entry if the model was drawn on binned-down samples
or a whole binned-down tomogram but you intend to make an unbinned tomogram.
The scale factor is the binning factor.

[Field = AngleOffsetOld]
short = angle
type = F
usage = Angle offset in the alignment used to make the samples
tooltip = 
manpage = Angle offset in the alignment used to make the samples.  If this
entry is present, the program will output the original, added, and total 
offset.

[Field = ZShiftOld]
short = zshift
type = F
usage = Z shift value in the alignment used to make the samples
tooltip = 
manpage = Z shift value in the alignment used to make the samples, in unbinned
pixels.  If this
entry is present, the program will output the original, added, and total 
Z shift.

[Field = XAxisTiltOld]
short = xtilt
type = F
usage = X axis tilt applied when the samples were made
tooltip = 
manpage = X axis tilt applied when the samples were made.  If this
entry is present, the program will output the original, added, and total 
X axis tilt.

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.

[Field = usage]
short = help
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage =
