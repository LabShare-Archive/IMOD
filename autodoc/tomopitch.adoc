[Field = InputFile]
short = model
long = ModelFile
type = FNM
usage = Model file with lines to analyze
tooltip = 
manpage = Model file with lines to analyze.  If there are multiple model
file entries, they should be in order that they will be considered in the 
program.

[Field = ExtraThickness]
short = extra
long = ExtraThickness
type = F
usage = Additional pixels of thickness to add on top and bottom
tooltip = 
manpage = Additional pixels of thickness to add to both the top and the bottom 
of the tomogram, beyond the region described by the model lines.

[Field = SpacingInY]
short = spacing
long = SpacingInY
type = F
usage = Spacing between tomogram samples (distance in Y in tilted views)
tooltip =
manpage = Spacing between tomogram samples (distance in Y in tilted views).
If a non-zero number is entered, the program will
compute the tilt around the X-axis that will make the tomogram be
flat in its Z dimension. 

[Field = ScaleFactor]
short = scale
long = ScaleFactor
type = F
usage = Amount to scale the recommended Z shift and thickness (for binned-down
samples)
tooltip =
manpage = Amount by which to scale the Z shift and thickness recommended by
the program.  Use this entry if the model was drawn on binned-down samples
or a whole binned-down tomogram but you intend to make an unbinned tomogram.
The scale factor factor is the binning factor.

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
long = ParameterFile
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.

[Field = usage]
short = help
long = usage
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip =
