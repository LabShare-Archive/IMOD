there are multiple circle objects, enter one value to apply to all objects or
a value for each object.

[Field = ExpandCircleIterations]

usage = Number of iterations for expanding patches around circles
tooltip = 
manpage = Number of iterations of a procedure that expands the area erased
around the points of a circle object.  This procedure analyzes the intensity
of pixels adjacent to the patch being erased and adds pixels in the
appropriate tail of the intensity distribution to the patch.  Iterating simply
repeats the procedure.  If edges of gold particles are left because points are
not very well centered, try this option instead of just increasing the radius,
as it will tend to erase just the remaining points on the edge instead of a
whole ring of points.

usage = Merge patches in model that touch each other
tooltip = Merge patches in the model that touch each other, if the
resulting patch is less than the maximum radius

which includes terms in x, y, x**2, y**2 and x*y.  The order can be between 0
and 3, where 0 will simply replace the pixels with the mean of the border
points instead of fitting to them.
 
[Field = ExcludeAdjacent]
short = exclude
type = B
usage = Exclude points adjacent to patch points from the fit
tooltip = 
manpage = Exclude points adjacent to patch points from the fit; in other
words, compute the polynomial fit to points that do not touch the ones
being replaced.
