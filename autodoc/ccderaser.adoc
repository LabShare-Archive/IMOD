on the command line. 

[Field = OutputFile]

not run in trial mode, pixels will be replaced in the input file.  USE

differences

manpage = An extra-large peak will be erased only if the value for 
the maximum difference between adjacent pixels, averaged over the most
extreme one-fourth of the pixels in the patch, exceeds this criterion,
evaluated as the number of SDs above the mean absolute difference
between adjacent pixels in the scan area.  The default is 19.  This high a
value is needed to prevent gold erasure on low-noise data sets with small gold
particles, and a lower value may be needed to make extra-large peak removal
useful.

[Field = MaxPixelsInDiffPatch]

criterion

0). 

[Field = PointModel]

entered, and / to specify all objects.

manpage = List of objects that contain boundary contours around pixels to be
replaced.  Ranges can be entered, and / to specify all objects.  Boundary
contours can be arbitrarily large.  When a contour encloses more than 1000
pixels, a different procedure is use to erase the points, and intensities are
tapered down over 8 pixels on the inside of the patch from the value of the
nearest pixel just outside the patch to the mean of the surrounding pixels.
 
[Field = AllSectionObjects]

type = FA
usage = Radii to use in place of defaults for points with no individual size
tooltip = 
manpage = For circle objects, this entry specifies a radius to use for points
without an individual point size instead of the
object's default sphere radius.  This entry is floating point and can be used
to overcome the limitations of having an integer default sphere radius.  If
there are multiple circle objects, enter one value to apply to all objects or
a value for each object.

[Field = ExpandCircleIterations]
short = expand
type = I
usage = Number of iterations for expanding patches around circles
tooltip = 
manpage = Number of iterations of a procedure that expands the area erased
around the points of a circle object.  This procedure analyzes the intensity
of pixels adjacent to the patch being erased and adds pixels in the
appropriate tail of the intensity distribution to the patch.  Iterating simply
repeats the procedure.  If edges of gold particles are left because points are
not very well centered, try this option instead of just increasing the radius,
as it will tend to erase just the remaining points on the edge instead of a
whole ring of points.

[Field = MergePatches]
short = merge
type = B
usage = Merge patches in model that touch each other
tooltip = Merge patches in the model that touch each other, if the
resulting patch is less than the maximum radius

input model.

includes terms in x, y, x**2, y**2 and x*y).
manpage = Order of polynomial to fit to border points.  The default is 2,
which includes terms in x, y, x**2, y**2 and x*y.  The order can be between 0
and 3, where 0 will simply replace the pixels with the mean of the border
points instead of fitting to them.
 
[Field = ExcludeAdjacent]
short = exclude
type = B
usage = Exclude points adjacent to patch points from the fit
tooltip = 
manpage = Exclude points adjacent to patch points from the fit; in other
words, compute the polynomial fit to points that do not touch the ones
being replaced.

[Field = TrialMode]
short = trial
type = B
usage = Analyze without writing output file
tooltip = Run ccderaser in trial mode creating a x-ray model which can be viewed
in 3dmod.  This will not create an output stack.
