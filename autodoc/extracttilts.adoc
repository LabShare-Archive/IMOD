[Field = InputFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Image file with header information to extract
tooltip = 
manpage = Image file with header information to extract.  If this option is
not entered, the first non-option argument will be taken as the input file.

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output file for header values (optional)
tooltip = 
manpage = Output file for header values.  If this option is
not entered, the second non-option argument will be taken as the output file.
If no output file is given, the values are printed to standard output.

[Field = MdocMetadataFile]
short = mdoc
type = B
usage = Obtain values from a metadata file named inputfile.mdoc
tooltip = 
manpage = Obtain values from a metadata file named with the name of the input
file plus '.mdoc', instead of from the extended header of the image file.  
A file with this name is generated by SerialEM when an option is selected to
save extra information in a metadata file.

[Field = OtherMetadataFile]
short = other
type = FN
usage = Other metadata file to obtain values from
tooltip = 
manpage = Obtain values from the metadata file with the given name, instead of
from the extended header of the image file.

[Field = TiltAngles]
short = tilts
type = B
usage = Extract tilt angles (the default behavior)
tooltip = 
manpage = Extract tilt angles from header or metadata file (the default
behavior).  The angles are in degrees.

[Field = StagePositions]
short = stage
type = B
usage = Extract stage positions
tooltip = 
manpage = Extract stage positions from header or metadata file.  The positions
are in microns.

[Field = Magnifications]
short = mag
type = B
usage = Extract magnifications
tooltip = 
manpage = Extract magnifications from header or metadata file.

[Field = Intensities]
short = intensities
type = B
usage = Extract intensities (C2/C3 values)
tooltip = 
manpage = Extract intensities from header or metadata file.  On the Tecnai,
these are the intensity values reported by Tecnai scripting, which range from
0 to 1 and differ by a scaling factor from the percent C2 readout in the
Tecnai user interface.  On the JEOL, they correspond to the percent C3 readout
shown in SerialEM.

[Field = ExposureDose]
short = exp
type = B
usage = Extract incident dose on specimen during camera exposure
tooltip = 
manpage = Extract incident dose on specimen during camera exposure, referred
to as exposure dose in SerialEM.  The units are electrons per square Angstrom.

[Field = CameraExposure]
short = camera
type = B
usage = Extract camera exposure time from metadata file
tooltip = 
manpage = Extract camera exposure time, in seconds, from metadata file.

[Field = PixelSpacing]
short = pixel
type = B
usage = Extract pixel size in Angstroms from metadata file
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = Defocus]
short = defocus
type = B
usage = Extract defocus in microns from metadata file
tooltip = 
manpage = Extract defocus in microns from metadata file.  The value is the
focus readout of the microscope, not the defocus measured by autofocusing.

[Field = WarnIfTiltsSuspicious]
short = warn
type = B
usage = Warn if extracted tilt angles may not be correct
tooltip = 
manpage = When extracting tilt angles, warn if more than half of them are near
zero or any are bigger than 95 degrees.

[Field = AllPieces]
short = all
type = B
usage = Extract the selected item for all pieces of a montage
tooltip = 
manpage = Extract the selected item for all pieces of a montage.  The default
is to output the value for the last piece of the montage at each Z value.


[Field = usage]
short = help
long = usage
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage =
