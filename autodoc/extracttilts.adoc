[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output file for header values (optional)
tooltip = 
manpage = Output file for header values.  If no output file is given, the
values are printed to standard output.

[Field = TiltAngles]
short = tilts
type = B
usage = Extract tilt angles from header (the default behavior)
tooltip = 
manpage = Extract tilt angles from header (the default behavior).  The angles 
are in degrees.

[Field = StagePositions]
short = stage
type = B
usage = Extract stage positions from header
tooltip = 
manpage = Extract stage positions from header.  The positions are in microns.

[Field = Magnifications]
short = mag
type = B
usage = Extract magnifications from header
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = Intensities]
short = intensities
type = B
usage = Extract intensities (C2 values) from header
tooltip = 
manpage = Extract intensities from header.  On the Tecnai, these are the
intensity values reported by Tecnai scripting, which range from 0 to 1 and
differ by a scaling factor from the percent C2 readout in the Tecnai user
interface.  On the JEOL, they correspond to the percent C3 readout shown
in SerialEM.

[Field = ExposureDose]
short = exp
type = B
usage = Extract incident dose on specimen during camera exposure
tooltip = 
manpage = Extract incident dose on specimen during camera exposure, referred
to as exposure dose in SerialEM.  The units are electrons per square Angstrom.

[Field = WarnIfTiltsSuspicious]
short = warn
type = B
usage = Warn if extracted tilt angles may not be correct
tooltip = 
manpage = When extracting tilt angles, warn if more than half of them are near
zero or any are bigger than 95 degrees.

[Field = AllPieces]
short = all
type = B
usage = Extract the selected item for all pieces of a montage
tooltip = 
manpage = Extract the selected item for all pieces of a montage.  The default
is to output the value for the last piece of the montage at each Z value.
