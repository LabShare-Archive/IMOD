[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output file for results
tooltip = 
manpage = Output file for results. If this option is not entered, the 
first non-option argument will be used for the filename.

[Field = ColumnsToOutput]
short = columns
type = LI
usage = List of columns to output (values ranging from 1 to 26)
tooltip = 
manpage = List of columns to output (values ranging from 1 to 26).  For paired
MT walls, columns 1-6 and 19-22 are for the left walls, 7-12 and 23-26 are for
the right walls, and 13-18 are the sum of values from 1-6 and 7-12.  
Unpaired walls are treated as left walls, and their values will appear in
both columns 1-6 and 13-18.  See description of computed values above.

[Field = PixelSizeDefault]
short = pixel
type = F
usage = Default pixel size in nm, for models without pixel size (default 1)
tooltip = 
manpage = Default pixel size in nm, which will be used for any models that do
not have a pixel size defined.  The default is 1, namely results will be in
pixels.

[Field = WidthDefault]
short = width
type = F
usage = Default width between walls in nm, used for unpaired walls
tooltip = 
manpage = Default width between walls in nm.  This value is used to compute
normalized areas for unpaired walls.  The default is 20.

[Field = UseSurfaceNumbers]
short = surface
type = B
usage = Use surface numbers to pair wall tracings and match with markers
tooltip = 
manpage = Use surface numbers to determine whether two wall tracings are
paired and whether a horizontal marker contour matches a wall tracing.  This
is not the default because surface numbers might have been introduced by
accident.

[Field = ModelFile]
short = model
type = FNM
usage = Input model file with tracings of microtubule walls
tooltip = 
manpage =  

[Field = FitTopAndBottom]
short = fit
type = FPM
usage = Starting and ending fraction or distance from top for line fit
tooltip = 
manpage = Upper and lower limits for the line fit.  The limits are entered
as either an absolute distance from the maximum Y for a MT or a fraction of
the distance from the maximum to the minimum Y.  If the upper limit is 0,
the maximum Y is used.  If the lower limit is 0, the limit used depends on
whether there is a horizontal marker line or not.  If there is a line, it is
used as the limit; if not, the second point of the contour is used as the
lower limit.  Enter this option once to use the same limit for all models, or
once per model.  If it is not entered, the default limis are 0,0.

[Field = Identifier]
short = id
type = IM
usage = First ID number, or ID number for each model
tooltip = 
manpage = ID number for output.  Enter this option either once to specify a
starting ID number, or once per model.  If it is not entered, the ID numbers
start at 1.

[Field = usage]
short = help
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage =
