[Field = InputImageFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input image filename
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of input image file.  If it is not entered with this option it 
must be entered with the first non-option argument.

[Field = OutputModelFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output model filename
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of output model file.  If it is not entered with this option it 
must be entered with the second non-option argument.

[Field = FilteredImageFile]
short = filtered
type = FN
usage = Output file for scaled, Sobel filtered images
tooltip = 
manpage = Output file for images after they have been scaled 
and Sobel filtered.  The coordinate system in the header will be congruent
with that of the original image file so that the model can be displayed on it.

[Field = AreaModel]
short = area
type = FN
usage = Model with contours enclosing areas to analyze
tooltip = 
manpage = Model with contours enclosing areas to analyze.  More than one
contour can be included on each section.  If there are no contours on a
section within the range being analyzed, the entire section will be used.

[Field = AddToModel]
short = add
type = FN
usage = Model to append points to, with duplicates eliminated
tooltip = 
manpage = Model to append to.  After the analysis of histograms and thresholds,
detected points will be eliminated if they are within the criterion spacing of
a point in an existing object (where closed contour objects are excluded).
Points will be stored in new objects.  

[Field = ReferenceModel]
short = ref
type = FN
usage = Model with all beads marked in defined areas
tooltip = 
manpage = Model with all beads marked in defined areas, used for determining
the accuracy of the bead detection.

[Field = BoundaryObject]
short = boundary
type = I
usage = Object in reference model with boundaries of fully marked areas 
tooltip = 
manpage = Object in reference model with contours around the areas where beads
have been fully marked.

[Field = BeadSize]
short = size
type = F
usage = Size of beads in pixels
tooltip = 
manpage = Size of beads in pixels, a required entry.  A model bead of this
size is constructed for the first round of correlation, and this size together
with the scaled size determine how much images will be scaled for filtering.

[Field = LightBeads]
short = light
type = B
usage = Beads are light on dark background
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = ScaledSize]
short = scaled
type = F
usage = Size of beads in images scaled down for filtering (default 8)
tooltip = 
manpage = Size of beads in images scaled down for filtering; this entry
together with the bead size determine the amount of scaling.  In tests,
values of 7 to 10 have been found to give the best detection with Sobel
filter.  The default value is 8.

[Field = MinInterpolationFactor]
short = interpmin
type = F
usage = Minimum reduction factor to be achieved by interpolation, not binning
tooltip = 
manpage = When images are being scaled down, this entry determines how much
of the scaling down must be done with interpolation instead of binning.
Interpolation will preserve high frequency information better than binning
does but may amplify noise.  The default value is 1.4, which means that data
will not be binned unless they are being scaled down by a factor of at least
2.8.  This entry makes no difference unless images are being scaled down by
more than a factor of 2.

[Field = LinearInterpolation]
short = linear
type = I
usage = 1 to use linear instead of cubic interpolation, -1 to use antialias filter
tooltip = 
manpage = This option controls the type of interpolation used in scaling
images.  Enter 1 to use linear instead of cubic interpolation; this option will help to
reduce noise.  Alternatively, enter -1 to use antialiased image reduction when
images are being scaled down.  With this option, large size reductions will be done
in one step instead of with binning then interpolation.  The noise reduction
from antialias filtering would probably make kernel filtering unnecessary.

[Field = CenterWeight]
short = center
type = F
usage = Weight of center pixel in filter (1: Prewitt, 2: Sobel, default 2)
tooltip = 
manpage = The weighting for the center pixel in the edge detecting filter; 1
and 2 correspond to Prewitt and Sobel filters, respectively; the default is 2.

[Field = BoxSizeScaled]
short = box
type = I
usage = Box size for correlating and averaging in scaled down images
tooltip = 
manpage = Box size for correlating and averaging beads in scaled down images.
The default is 3 times the scaled size plus 2.

[Field = ThresholdForAveraging]
short = threshold
type = F
usage = Threshold relative peak strength or number of beads for averaging
tooltip = 
manpage = Threshold relative peak strength or number of beads for averaging.
With a non-zero entry, selected beads from the first round of filtering and
correlation are averaged to produce a reference for a second round.  If a
negative value is entered, the program will analyze the histogram of peak
strengths and find the dip indicating the best boundary between actual and
false beads.  The value has
4 different meanings depending on the range:
^  Greater than 1: an absolute number of beads with the strongest peaks
^  Between 0 and 1: minimum relative peak strength
^  Between 0 and -1: negative of strongest fraction of peaks above histogram 
dip
^  -2: 1/4 of way from histogram dip to histogram peak (the default)

[Field = StorageThreshold]
short = store
type = F
usage = Threshold relative peak strength for storing peaks in model
tooltip = 
manpage = Threshold relative peak strength for storing peaks in model.  With a
value of 0 (the default), the program will find the dip in the histogram of
peak strengths, find the mean and SD of the strengths above the dip, and store
all of the beads above the dip plus additional ones below the dip.  The latter
will be up to the 5 SD's below the mean or up to the number of ones above the
dip.  Enter a number between 0 and 1 to specify a relative
strength above which peaks will be stored.  Enter a negative number to specify
the number to store as a fraction of the number above the histogram dip (e.g.,
-1 for all points above the dip, -0.33 for the strongest 1/3 above the dip,
-1.33 for all above plus 1/3 that many below the dip.)

[Field = BackgroundGroups]
short = bkgd
type = F
usage = Number of groups to analyze based on background (default 4)
tooltip = 
manpage = After finding peaks, the program will sort the peaks based on the
background density into the number of groups given by this entry, as long as
there are at least 100 peaks in each group.  The histogram will be analyzed
separately for each group to find the dip, and then the peak strengths will be
scaled so as to superimpose the dip values.  This scaling should make a single
threshold value work better across a range of intensities.
The default value is 4; enter 0 to prevent this analysis.

[Field = AnnulusPercentile]
short = annulus
type = F
usage = Fractional percentile of annular pixels to use as background
tooltip = 
manpage = By default, the program will use the mean in an annulus around the
bead as the background for the analysis by groups.  This entry specifies a
percentile of the pixel values to use instead (e.g., 0.5 for the median).

[Field = MinRelativeStrength]
short = peakmin
type = F
usage = Minimum relative peak strength for retaining peak in analysis
tooltip = 
manpage = Minimum relative peak strength, after any background scaling, for
keeping a peak in the analysis.  Too many weak peaks can prevent a dip from
showing up in the smoothed histogram of strengths.  The default is 0.1, or
0.05 if a threshold for averaging is being found from histograms.

[Field = MinSpacing]
short = spacing
type = F
usage = Minimum spacing between peaks as fraction of bead size (default 1)
tooltip = 
manpage = Minimum spacing between peaks as a fraction of the bead size.  When
two peaks are closer than this distance apart, the weaker one is eliminated.
The default is 1, but values of 0.8 to 0.9 are helpful for getting a more 
complete set of beads.

[Field = SectionsToDo]
short = sections
type = LI
usage = List of sections to run (comma-separated ranges numbered from 0)
tooltip = 
manpage = List of sections to run.  Comma-separated ranges can be entered;
sections are numbered from 0.  By default, all sections will be analyzed.

[Field = MaxSectionsPerAnalysis]
short = maxsec
type = I
usage = Maximum number of sections to include in one analysis
tooltip = 
manpage = Maximum number of sections to include in one analysis.  With this
entry, the list of sections will be divided into groups no bigger than this
size.  Each group will be analyzed separately and results will be stored in a
separate model object with its own threshold value.  By default, all sections
are analyzed together.

[Field = RemakeModelBead]
short = remake
type = B
usage = Start with model bead for each separate analysis
tooltip = 
manpage = Start with a model bead for each separate analysis when more than
one group of sections is being analyzed.  The default is to use the average
from the previous group for the first round of correlation on a group.

[Field = MinGuessNumBeads]
short = guess
type = I
usage = A guess for the minimum number of beads per section
tooltip = 
manpage = A guess for the minimum number of beads per section.  This entry may
sometimes be required to help the program find a dip in the histogram,
especially if there are very few beads.

[Field = MeasureToUse]
short = measure
type = I
usage = Measure to use for peak strengths (0 correlation, 1 integral, 2 mean)
tooltip = 
manpage = Measure to use for peak strengths: 0 for the correlation peak, 1 for 
the integral of density above the background, 2 for the geometric mean of
these two.  The default is 1; integrals were slightly better in test data sets.

[Field = KernelSigma]
short = kernel
type = F
usage = Sigma in pixels for real-space smoothing with Gaussian kernel
tooltip = 
manpage = Sigma for real-space smoothing with a Gaussian kernel (in pixels).
The smoothing is with a 3x3, 5x5 or 7x7 kernel whose coefficients are
proportional to a Gaussian with the given sigma centered on the central
pixel.  This smoothing is applied before the image is scaled for filtering.
The default is 0.85, which is equivalent to the simple smoothing filter in
Clip(1) and 3dmod(1).

[Field = FilterRadius1]
short = rad1
type = F
usage = Left cutoff radius for filter
tooltip = 
manpage = Low spatial frequencies in the cross-correlation will be attenuated
by a Gaussian curve that is 1 at this cutoff radius and falls off below this
radius with a standard deviation specified by FilterSigma2.  Spatial
frequency units range from 0 to 0.5.  Use FilterSigma1 instead of this entry
for more predictable attenuation of low frequencies.

[Field = FilterRadius2]
short = rad2
type = F
usage = Right cutoff radius for filter
tooltip = High frequency cutoff radius for Gaussian filter
manpage = High spatial frequencies in the cross-correlation will be attenuated
by a Gaussian curve that is 1 at this cutoff radius and falls off above this
radius with a standard deviation specified by FilterSigma2.

[Field = FilterSigma1]
short = sig1
type = F
usage = Sigma for low-frequency inverted Gaussian filter
tooltip = 
manpage = Sigma value to filter low frequencies in the correlations with a
curve that is an inverted Gaussian.  This filter is 0 at 0 frequency and decays
up to 1 with the given sigma value.  However, if a negative value of radius1
is entered, this filter will be zero from 0 to |radius1| then decay up to 1.

[Field = FilterSigma2]
short = sig2
type = F
usage = Sigma for Gaussian rolloff below radius1 and above radius2
tooltip = Sigma for Gaussian rolloff below low frequency cutoff and above 
high frequency cutoff
manpage = Sigma value for the Gaussian rolloff below and above the cutoff
frequencies specified by FilterRadius1 and FilterRadius2

[Field = VerboseKeys]
short = verbose
type = CH
usage = Key letters for verbose output
tooltip = 
manpage = Key letters for verbose output (1 for general, p for peak, f for
first, l for last, e for every hist)

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.
