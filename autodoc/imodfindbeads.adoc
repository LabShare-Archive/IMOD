[Field = InputImageFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input image filename
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of input image file.  If it is not entered with this option it 
must be entered with the first non-option argument.

[Field = OutputModelFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output model filename
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of output model file.  If it is not entered with this option it 
must be entered with the second non-option argument.

[Field = FilteredImageFile]
short = filtered
type = FN
usage = Output file for scaled, Sobel filtered images
tooltip = 
manpage = Output file for images after they have been scaled 
and Sobel filtered.  The coordinate system in the header will be congruent
with that of the original image file so that the model can be displayed on it.

[Field = AreaModel]
short = area
type = FN
usage = Model with contours enclosing areas to analyze or exclude
tooltip = 
manpage = Model with contours enclosing areas to analyze or to exclude from
analysis, depending on whether the -exclude option is given also.  More than one
contour can be included on each section.  If there are no contours on a
section within the range being analyzed, the contours on the nearest section
with contours will be used.

[Field = ExcludeInsideAreas]
short = exclude
type = B
usage = Use the area model to exclude regions from analysis
tooltip =
manpage = Use the contours in the area model to define regions to exclude from
analysis rather than regions to include.

[Field = QueryAreaOnSection]
short = query
type = I
usage = Report area included by area model on the given section and exit
tooltip =
manpage = Report area in megapixels that an area model includes
in the analysis for the given section, and then exit.  This is the sum of
areas inside the contours, or the whole image area minus that sum if -exclude
is given.  With this option, only the input and area models need to be entered.

[Field = PrealignTransformFile]
short = prexf
type = FN
usage = File with transforms used to align images being analyzed
tooltip = 
manpage = File with transformations applied to align the images being
analyzed.  The program will assume that the transformations consist only of
shifts and will use this information to avoid finding beads at the edge of a
filled area that has no image data.

[Field = ImagesAreBinned]
short = imagebinned
type = I
usage = The binning of the images relative to the original data (default 1)
tooltip = 
manpage = The current binning of the images relative to the original data.
This factor is needed to scale prealignment transforms.  The default is 1.

[Field = AddToModel]
short = add
type = FN
usage = Model to append points to, with duplicates eliminated
tooltip = 
manpage = Model to append to.  After the analysis of histograms and thresholds,
detected points will be eliminated if they are within the criterion spacing of
a point in an existing object (where closed contour objects are excluded).
Points will be stored in new objects.  

[Field = ReferenceModel]
short = ref
type = FN
usage = Model with all beads marked in defined areas
tooltip = 
manpage = Model with all beads marked in defined areas, used for determining
the accuracy of the bead detection.

[Field = BoundaryObject]
short = boundary
type = I
usage = Object in reference model with boundaries of fully marked areas 
tooltip = 
manpage = Object in reference model with contours around the areas where beads
have been fully marked.

[Field = BeadSize]
short = size
type = F
usage = Size of beads in pixels
tooltip = 
manpage = Size of beads in pixels, a required entry.  A model bead of this
size is constructed for the first round of correlation, and this size together
with the scaled size determine how much images will be scaled for filtering.

[Field = LightBeads]
short = light
type = B
usage = Beads are light on dark background
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = ScaledSize]
short = scaled
type = F
usage = Size of beads in images scaled down for filtering (default 8)
tooltip = 
manpage = Size of beads in images scaled down for filtering; this entry
together with the bead size determine the amount of scaling.  In tests,
values of 7 to 10 have been found to give the best detection with Sobel
filter.  The default value is 8.

[Field = AdjustSizes]
short = adjust
type = B
usage = Change size-based parameters using measured size of averaged bead
tooltip = 
manpage = Change all size-based parameters using the measured size of the averaged
bead.  After averaging selected beads, the program will estimate the bead
diameter by forming a radial average, finding the radius where the density falls
off the fastest, fitting a line to nearby points with sufficiently high
gradient, and finding the intersection of that line with the background
density at the edge of the average.  If the change is more than 5%, the
program will add a third pass through the data.  If the change is more than a
factor of 1.6, the change in size will be rejected as implausible.  This
method does not give the right diameter for gold on plastic sections, so this
option should be used only for cryo-samples or other samples taken with
significant underfocus.

[Field = MinInterpolationFactor]
short = interpmin
type = F
usage = Minimum reduction factor to be achieved by interpolation, not binning
tooltip = 
manpage = When images are being scaled down, this entry determines how much
of the scaling down must be done with interpolation instead of binning.
Interpolation will preserve high frequency information better than binning
does but may amplify noise.  The default value is 1.4, which means that data
will not be binned unless they are being scaled down by a factor of at least
2.8.  This entry makes no difference unless images are being scaled down by
more than a factor of 2.

[Field = LinearInterpolation]
short = linear
type = I
usage = 1 to use linear instead of cubic interpolation, -1 to use antialias filter
tooltip = 
manpage = This option controls the type of interpolation used in scaling
images.  Enter 1 to use linear instead of cubic interpolation; this option will help to
reduce noise.  Alternatively, enter -1 to use antialiased image reduction when
images are being scaled down.  With this option, large size reductions will be done
in one step instead of with binning then interpolation.  The noise reduction
from antialias filtering would probably make kernel filtering unnecessary.

[Field = CenterWeight]
short = center
type = F
usage = Weight of center pixel in filter (1: Prewitt, 2: Sobel, default 2)
tooltip = 
manpage = The weighting for the center pixel in the edge detecting filter; 1
and 2 correspond to Prewitt and Sobel filters, respectively; the default is 2.

[Field = BoxSizeScaled]
short = box
type = I
usage = Box size for correlating and averaging in scaled down images
tooltip = 
manpage = Box size for correlating and averaging beads in scaled down images.
The default is 3 times the scaled size plus 2.

[Field = ThresholdForAveraging]
short = threshold
type = F
usage = Threshold relative peak strength or number of beads for averaging
tooltip = 
manpage = Threshold relative peak strength or number of beads for averaging.
With a non-zero entry, selected beads from the first round of filtering and
correlation are averaged to produce a reference for a second round.  If a
negative value is entered, the program will analyze the histogram of peak
strengths and find the dip indicating the best boundary between actual and
false beads.  The value has
4 different meanings depending on the range:
^  Greater than 1: an absolute number of beads with the strongest peaks
^  Between 0 and 1: minimum relative peak strength
^  Between 0 and -1: negative of strongest fraction of peaks above histogram 
dip
^  -2: 1/4 of way from histogram dip to histogram peak (the default)

[Field = StorageThreshold]
short = store
type = F
usage = Threshold relative peak strength for storing peaks in model
tooltip = 
manpage = Threshold relative peak strength for storing peaks in model.  With a
value of 0 (the default), the program will find the dip in the histogram of
peak strengths, find the mean and SD of the strengths above the dip, and store
all of the beads above the dip plus additional ones below the dip.  The latter
will be up to the 5 SD's below the mean or up to the number of ones above the
dip.  Enter a number between 0 and 1 to specify a relative
strength above which peaks will be stored.  Enter a negative number to specify
the number to store as a fraction of the number above the histogram dip (e.g.,
-1 for all points above the dip, -0.33 for the strongest 1/3 above the dip,
-1.33 for all above plus 1/3 that many below the dip.)

[Field = FallbackThresholds]
short = fallback
type = IP
usage = # of peaks to average and # to store if no histogram dip is found
tooltip =
manpage = Number of peaks to average to make the reference for the second
round, and number of peaks to store in the model, if no dip is found when
analyzing the histogram of the respective set of peaks.  If this option is not
entered, or if 0 is entered for one of the fallbacks, then the program exits
with an error after failing to find a histogram dip.

[Field = BackgroundGroups]
short = bkgd
type = F
usage = Number of groups to analyze based on background (default 4)
tooltip = 
manpage = After finding peaks, the program will sort the peaks based on the
background density into the number of groups given by this entry, as long as
there are at least 100 peaks in each group.  The histogram will be analyzed
separately for each group to find the dip, and then the peak strengths will be
scaled so as to superimpose the dip values.  This scaling should make a single
threshold value work better across a range of intensities.
The default value is 4; enter 0 to prevent this analysis.

[Field = AnnulusPercentile]
short = annulus
type = F
usage = Fractional percentile of annular pixels to use as background
tooltip = 
manpage = By default, the program will use the mean in an annulus around the
bead as the background for the analysis by groups.  This entry specifies a
percentile of the pixel values to use instead (e.g., 0.5 for the median).

[Field = MinRelativeStrength]
short = peakmin
type = F
usage = Minimum relative peak strength for retaining peak in analysis
tooltip = 
manpage = Minimum relative peak strength, after any background scaling, for
keeping a peak in the analysis.  Too many weak peaks can prevent a dip from
showing up in the smoothed histogram of strengths.  The default is 0.1, or
0.05 if a threshold for averaging is being found from histograms.

[Field = MinSpacing]
short = spacing
type = F
usage = Minimum spacing between peaks as fraction of bead size (default 1)
tooltip = 
manpage = Minimum spacing between peaks as a fraction of the bead size.  When
two peaks are closer than this distance apart, the weaker one is eliminated.
The default is 1, but values of 0.8 to 0.9 are helpful for getting a more 
complete set of beads.

[Field = SectionsToDo]
short = sections
type = LI
usage = List of sections to run (comma-separated ranges numbered from 0)
tooltip = 
manpage = List of sections to run.  Comma-separated ranges can be entered;
sections are numbered from 0.  By default, all sections will be analyzed.

[Field = MaxSectionsPerAnalysis]
short = maxsec
type = I
usage = Maximum number of sections to include in one analysis
tooltip = 
manpage = Maximum number of sections to include in one analysis.  With this
entry, the list of sections will be divided into groups no bigger than this
size.  Each group will be analyzed separately and results will be stored in a
separate model object with its own threshold value.  By default, all sections
are analyzed together.

[Field = RemakeModelBead]
short = remake
type = B
usage = Start with model bead for each separate analysis
tooltip = 
manpage = Start with a model bead for each separate analysis when more than
one group of sections is being analyzed.  The default is to use the average
from the previous group for the first round of correlation on a group.

[Field = MinGuessNumBeads]
short = guess
type = I
usage = A guess for the minimum number of beads per section
tooltip = 
manpage = A guess for the minimum number of beads per section.  This entry may
sometimes be required to help the program find a dip in the histogram,
especially if there are very few beads.

[Field = MeasureToUse]
short = measure
type = I
usage = Measure to use for peak strengths (0 correlation, 1 integral, 2 mean)
tooltip = 
manpage = Measure to use for peak strengths: 0 for the correlation peak, 1 for 
the integral of density above the background, 2 for the geometric mean of
these two.  The default is 1; integrals were slightly better in test data sets.

[Field = KernelSigma]
short = kernel
type = F
usage = Sigma in pixels for real-space smoothing with Gaussian kernel
tooltip = 
manpage = Sigma for real-space smoothing with a Gaussian kernel (in pixels).
The smoothing is with a 3x3, 5x5 or 7x7 kernel whose coefficients are
proportional to a Gaussian with the given sigma centered on the central
pixel.  This smoothing is applied before the image is scaled for filtering.
The default is 0.85, which is equivalent to the simple smoothing filter in
Clip(1) and 3dmod(1).

[Field = FilterRadius1]
short = rad1
type = F
usage = Left cutoff radius for filter
tooltip = 
manpage = Low spatial frequencies in the cross-correlation will be attenuated
by a Gaussian curve that is 1 at this cutoff radius and falls off below this
radius with a standard deviation specified by FilterSigma2.  Spatial
frequency units range from 0 to 0.5.  Use FilterSigma1 instead of this entry
for more predictable attenuation of low frequencies.

[Field = FilterRadius2]
short = rad2
type = F
usage = Right cutoff radius for filter
tooltip = High frequency cutoff radius for Gaussian filter
manpage = High spatial frequencies in the cross-correlation will be attenuated
by a Gaussian curve that is 1 at this cutoff radius and falls off above this
radius with a standard deviation specified by FilterSigma2.

[Field = FilterSigma1]
short = sig1
type = F
usage = Sigma for low-frequency inverted Gaussian filter
tooltip = 
manpage = Sigma value to filter low frequencies in the correlations with a
curve that is an inverted Gaussian.  This filter is 0 at 0 frequency and decays
up to 1 with the given sigma value.  However, if a negative value of radius1
is entered, this filter will be zero from 0 to |radius1| then decay up to 1.

[Field = FilterSigma2]
short = sig2
type = F
usage = Sigma for Gaussian rolloff below radius1 and above radius2
tooltip = Sigma for Gaussian rolloff below low frequency cutoff and above 
high frequency cutoff
manpage = Sigma value for the Gaussian rolloff below and above the cutoff
frequencies specified by FilterRadius1 and FilterRadius2

[Field = VerboseKeys]
short = verbose
type = CH
usage = Key letters for verbose output
tooltip = 
manpage = Key letters for verbose output (1 for general, p for peak, f for
first, l for last, e for every hist)

[Field = DumpHistogramFile]
short = dump
type = FN
usage = Name of file in which to write all histograms
tooltip =
manpage = Name of file in which to write all histograms.  Each histogram will
be written with a type number, the peak strength, and the actual or smoothed
number of counts.  The program will use successive type numnbers and print a
line describing the histogram written with each type number.  Histograms can
be displayed with commands like 
^   onegenplot -con -sym 0 -ty <type>  <filename>
^where <type> is a type number and <filename> is the name provided with this
option.  Add the option "-ylog 10" to spread out the low parts of the
histogram.

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.
