[Field = InputFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input text fie with points
tooltip = 
manpage = Input text file with points.  If this option
is not entered, the first non-option argument will be used for the input
file.

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output file for model
tooltip = 
manpage = Output file for model.  If this option
is not entered, the second non-option argument will be used for the output
file.

[Field = OpenContours]
short = open
type = B
usage = Make objects be open contour type (default is closed contour)
tooltip = 
manpage = The default is to make all objects be closed contour type.  This
option and -scat can be used to make all objects be open or scattered,
respectively. 

[Field = ScatteredPoints]
short = scat
type = B
usage = Make objects be scattered point type
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = PointsPerContour]
short = number
type = I
usage = Maximum number of points per contour
tooltip = 
manpage = Maximum number of points per contour.  The default is to put all 
points into one contour.  This option is not allowed if the point file has
contour numbers.

[Field = PlanarContours]
short = planar
type = B
usage = Start a new contour at each new Z value encountered
tooltip = 
manpage = Start a new contour at each new Z value encountered when reading
sequentially through the lines of input.  This option is not allowed if the
point file has contour numbers.

[Field = NumberedFromZero]
short = zero
type = B
usage = Objects and contours are numbered from 0 instead of 1
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = ValuesInLastColumn]
short = values
type = I
usage = 1 or -1 to store last number on each line as a point or contour value
tooltip = 
manpage = Use this option to indicate that lines have a general value
at the end, after the Z coordinate.   Enter 1 to have the value stored as a
point value, or -1 to have the value stored as a contour value.  With point
values, a value must appear on every line.  With contour values, the first
point in each contour must have a value, and values on later points in a
contour will be ignored and need not be present.  Note that if a file has
values and this option is not given, the coordinates will NOT be read correctly
unless the file has both object and contour numbers, because the program will
think that the X coordinate is a contour number.

[Field = CircleSize]
short = circle
type = I
usage = Turn on display of circles of this size (radius) at each point
tooltip = 
manpage = Turn on display of circles of this size (radius) at each point.  If
the points form open contours that progress through Z, this option will let
you see them in the Zap window of 3dmod without having to edit the object.

[Field = SphereRadius]
short = sphere
type = I
usage = Turn on display of spheres of this radius at each point
tooltip = 
manpage = Turn on display of spheres of this radius at each point.  Use this
option to see scattered points in 3dmod without having to edit the object.

[Field = ColorOfObject]
short = color
type = ITM
usage = Color to make object (red, green, blue ranging from 0 to 255)
tooltip =
manpage = Color to make an object; enter red, green, and blue values ranging
from 0 to 255.  To assign colors to multiple objects, enter this option
multiple times.

[Field = NameOfObject]
short = name
type = CHM
usage = Name to give object
tooltip =
manpage = Name to give an object; enter a text string, enclosed in quotes if
it contains spaces.  To assign names to multiple objects, enter this option
multiple times.

[Field = ImageForCoordinates]
short = image
type = FN
usage = Make the model's coordinate system match this image file
tooltip = 
manpage = Make the model's coordinate system match this image file.  This
is not needed for loading the model onto this image in 3dmod, but will allow
the model to be used together with this image file in various programs
(e.g., Beadtrack) without having to load it into 3dmod and save it.

[Field = PixelSpacingOfImage]
short = pixel
type = FT
usage = Pixel spacing, or scale in X, Y, and Z, of the model's coordinate system
tooltip =
manpage = Set the reference scaling information of the model to the given X,
Y, and Z scale factors, which would correspond to the pixel spacing in an
image file header.  The entry together with -origin provides an alternative to the
-image option, so -image cannot be used together with -pixel or -origin.
Like -image, these entries are not needed for loading the model into 3dmod
together with an image file of the same scaling, but would be useful for
loading into 3dmod with an image at a different binning, or for use in other
programs that require the scaling to be correct.  This entry does not set the
pixel size entry in the model header.

[Field = OriginOfImage]
short = origin
type = FT
usage = Origin in X, Y, and Z of the model's coordinate system
tooltip =
manpage = Set the reference information of the model to the given X, Y, and Z
translations, which would correspond to the origin in an image file header.
