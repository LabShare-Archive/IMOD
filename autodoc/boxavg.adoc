[Field = InputImageFile]
short = image
type = FN
usage = Input image file
tooltip = 
manpage = Input file with images containing features to average.  If this
option is not entered, the first non-option argument will be used for this
input file.

[Field = PointModelFile]
short = points
type = FN
usage =  Name of model file with points to be averaged
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of model file with points to be averaged.  If this option
is not entered, the second non-option argument will be used for this input
file.

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output file for average image
tooltip = 
manpage = Output file for average image.  If this option
is not entered, the third non-option argument will be used for this output
file.

[Field = PieceListFile]
short = piece
long = PieceListFile
type = FN
usage = Name of piece list file if image is montaged or out of sequence
tooltip =
manpage =  

[Field = ObjectsToAverage]
short = objects
type = LI
usage = List of objects with points to average
tooltip = 
manpage = List of objects with points to average (comma-separated ranges
allowed).  The default is to take all points from all open contour or
scattered point objects.  This option can be used to select a subset of
objects
in the model or force the use of a closed contour object.

[Field = BoxSizeXandY]
short = box
type = IP
usage = Size of box to average in X and Y
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = ModeOfOutput]
short = mode
type = I
usage = Mode for output (default is same as input)
tooltip = 
manpage = Mode for output: 0 for byte, 1 for integer, 2 for real, 6 for
unsigned integer.  The default is the same as that of the input.

[Field = PassesThroughData]
short = passes
type = I
usage = Number of passes (1 or 2, default is 2 to align to first average)
tooltip = 
manpage = Number of passes through the data, either 1 or 2.  On the second
pass, the boxes will be aligned to the average from the first pass.  The
default is 2; enter 1 to skip the alignment pass.

[Field = LinearInterpolation]
short = linear
type = B
usage = Use linear instead of cubic interpolation when extracting box
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[SectionHeader = ObsoleteOptions]
usage = OBSOLETE OPTIONS
manpage = OBSOLETE OPTIONS
^  These options are not needed when Xcorrstack(1) is used to correlate 
^  an average with images.

[Field = SizeOfOutputXandY]
short = size
type = IP
usage = Size of output file in X and Y (default is same size as box)
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = FillValue]
short = fill
type = F
usage = Value to fill with when output array is bigger than box
tooltip = 
manpage = Value to fill with when output array is bigger than box.  The
default is the mean along the edge of the average image.  This entry is
ignored if the output is the same size as the box.

[Field = SplitIntoCorners]
short = split
type = B
usage = Split average into the four corners of the output array
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = ZeroMean]
short = zero
type = B
usage = Shift the output to have a zero mean value
tooltip = 
manpage = Shift the output to have a zero mean value.  This option is ignored
if the data mode of the output is bytes or unsigned integers.

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.

[Field = usage]
short = help
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage =
