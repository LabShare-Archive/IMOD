manpage = Name of output image file.  If this option is not entered, the third
non-option argument will be taken as this name.

[Field = PaddingPixels]
short = p
type = I

tooltip =
manpage = Number of pixels of padding on each edge of each subvolume.  The
default is 8.

[Field = OverlapPixels]
short = o
type = I
usage = Minimum # of pixels of overlap between subvolumes
tooltip =
manpage = Minimum number of pixels of overlap between the subvolumes.  The

[Field = MegavoxelMaximum]
short = m
type = I
usage = Maximum # of megavoxels in each subvolume

[Field = XMaximumPieces]
short = xm
type = I
usage = Maximum # of pieces in X direction
tooltip = 
manpage = The maximum number of chunks in the X direction.  The default is -1,
