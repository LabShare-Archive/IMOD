[Field = AFileSubtractFrom]
short = afile
type = FN
usage = Input image file to subtract images from (file A)
tooltip = 
manpage = Input image file to subtract images from (file A).  If this option
is not entered, the first non-option argument will be used for this input
file.

[Field = BFileSubtractOff]
short = bfile
type = FN
usage = Input image file B with images to subtract from A
tooltip = 
manpage = Input image file B with images to subtract from A.  If this option
is not entered, the second non-option argument will be used for this input
file, if it exists.  If this file is
not specified at all, a backup file to A will be used (the A filename with ~ 
appended).

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output file C for difference images (omit for statistics only)
tooltip = 
manpage = Output file C for difference images.  If this option
is not entered, the third non-option argument will be used for this output
file, if it exists.  If this file is not
specified at all, only statistics will be 
reported for each section.

[Field = ModeOfOutput]
short = mode
type = I
usage = Mode for output file (1 for integers, 2 for floating point)
tooltip = 
manpage = Mode for output file (1 for integers, 2 for floating point).  Bytes
(mode 0) are rarely suitable for a difference image since they are unsigned.

[Field = ASectionList]
short = asections
type = LI
usage = List of sections in file A (numbered from 0, default is all sections)
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = BSectionList]
short = bsections
type = LI
usage = List of sections in file B (numbered from 0, default is all sections)
tooltip = 
manpage = List of sections in file B.  Sections are numbered from 0.  The
default is to use the first N sections in the file, where N is the number
of sections in the list for file A.

[Field = ZeroMeanOutput]
short = zero
type = B
usage = Subtract mean difference for each section to make mean output 0
tooltip = 
manpage = Make the mean of the output be zero for each section by subtracting
the mean difference between sections from the difference.

[Field = LowThreshold]
short = low
type = F
usage = Truncate output to eliminate values below this threshold
tooltip = 
manpage = Truncate the output by replacing values below this theshold with
the threshold value.

[Field = HighThreshold]
short = high
type = F
usage = Truncate output to eliminate values above this threshold
tooltip = 
manpage = Truncate the output by replacing values above this theshold with
the threshold value.

#[Field = TestLimit]
#short = test
#type = I
#usage = Limit for the size of the array used to read and write data
#tooltip = 
#manpage = Limit for the size of the array used to read and write data.  This
#entry can be used to test whether reading and writing in chunks is working
#properly.

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.

[Field = usage]
short = help

usage = Print help output
