[Field = InputFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input volume file to be cloned
tooltip = 
manpage = Input volume file to clone. If this option is not entered, 
the first non-option argument will be used for the input file.

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output volume file to create
tooltip = 
manpage = Name to give the output volume. If this option is not entered,
the second non-option argument will be used.

[Field = AtPoints]
short = at
type = FN
usage = location/orientation file (see PEET program createdAlignedModel)
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of the summary file giving coordinates and orientations
at which clones are to be inserted.

[Field = IntoFile]
short = into
type = FN
usage = Volume into which to clone copies of the input. (Required).
tooltip = 
manpage = The volume to which the output should be initialized prior to
inserting any clones of the input. (Required).

[Field = XRange]
short = x
type = IP
usage = X coordinate range within which volumes will be cloned
tooltip = 
manpage =  The input volume will not be cloned at points outside this range.

[Field = YRange]
short = y
type = IP
usage = X coordinate range within which volumes will be cloned
tooltip = 
manpage =  The input volume will not be cloned at points outside this range.

[Field = ZRange]
short = z
type = IP
usage = X coordinate range within which volumes will be cloned
tooltip = 
manpage =  The input volume will not be cloned at points outside this range.

[Field = usage]
short = help
long = usage
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage = Print help output. 

[Field = ContourNumbers]
short = contours
type = LI
usage = Contours in the model of the original volume to include
(default is all).
tooltip =
manpage = A comma and dash separated list of contour numbers. If entered, 
clones will be created only at points belonging to one of the specified 
contours in the model of the original volume.

[Field = AlphaTransparency]
short = alpha
type = F
usage = Transparency to use when cloning volumes.
tooltip =
manpage = A floating point number between 0 and 1 specifying the transparency
to be used when cloning volumes  (default  0). If 0, cloned voxels will simply
replace the originals. More generally, the output voxels will be alpha times
the cloned voxel plus (1 - alpha) times the previous value. 

[Field = MaskFile]
short = mask
type = FN
usage = An optional byte file for masking the input volume.
tooltip = 
manpage = The name of a byte (mode 0) file which will be used to mask the input
volume. Non-zero values in this file indicate voxel locations in the input
volume which should be cloned.

[Field = rMin]
short = rmin
type = I
usage = The minimum distance from the center of the input volume at
which points should be cloned.
tooltip = 
manpage =  The input volume will not be cloned at radii smaller than this.

[Field = rMax]
short = rmax
type = I
usage = The maximum distance from the center of the input volume at
which points should be cloned.
tooltip = 
manpage =  The input volume will not be cloned at radii larger than this.
