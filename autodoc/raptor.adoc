[Field = RaptorExecPath]
short = execPath
type = CH
usage = Path where RAPTOR binaries are located (required)
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = InputPath]
short = path
type = CH
usage = Path where MRC stack to be aligned is located (required)
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = InputFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input filename, without the path (required)
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = OutputPath]
short = output
type = CH
usage = Path where output files will be saved (required)
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = Diameter]
short = diameter
type = IA
usage = Diameter(s) of the markers, in pixels (required)
tooltip = 
manpage = Diameter(s) of the markers, in pixels.  If you bin the image with
with the -bin option to RAPTOR, the diameter has to be the one in the original
image indicated by the -input entry, NOT the binned one. If the
dataset has more than one kind of marker just specify the different sizes
separated by commas.  This entry is required.
 
[Field = WhiteMarkers]
short = white
type = B
usage = Search for markers that are lighter than background
tooltip = 
manpage = Search for markers that have higher values than the background in
the MRC stack (like quantum dots or images with inverted constrast).

[Field = MarkersPerImage]
short = markers
type = I
usage = Number of markers to be tracked
tooltip = 
manpage = Number of markers to be tracked.  THIS IS A CRITICAL PARAMETER. If
Raptor fails aligning the stack try increasing this number (it will just make
the run slower). We have develop a method to
try to estimate this parameter automatically. If you don't specify a number,
RAPTOR will perform an estimation.

[Field = AnglesInHeader]
short = angles
type = B
usage = Extract tilt angles from input file header
tooltip = 
manpage = If this option is specified, RAPTOR will extract tilt angles from
the header of the input stack.  Otherwise, it will expect to find tilt angles
in a ".rawtlt" file.

[Field = Binning]
short = bin
type = I
usage = Amount to bin the stack before performing alignment
tooltip = 
manpage = With this option, RAPTOR will bin the stack before performing
alignment.  Remember that binning affects the diameter of the markers.

[Field = Reconstruction]
short = rec
type = I
usage = Mode for a reconstruction to be generated by Tilt
tooltip = 
manpage = If this option is specified, RAPTOR will run IMOD's Tilt(1) program
after alignment to perform the 3D reconstruction.  The entry must be 0,1 or 2
to indicate the mode of the reconstruction (0 for byte, 1 for signed integer,
2 for float).

[Field = Thickness]
short = thickness
type = I
usage = Thickness of the tomogram, if -rec option is entered
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = Orient]
short = orientation
type = I
usage = Handedness of tomogram with CalTech RAPTOR: -1 for inverted handedness
tooltip =
manpage = This option controls the handedness of a tomogram generated by the
CalTech version of RAPTOR (not the one in IMOD).  Enter -1 to use the PARALLEL
option when running Tilt(1), which inverts handedness; the default is to use
the RotateBy90 option.

[Field = TrackingOnly]
short = tracking
type = B
usage = Just generate fiducial model, not aligned stack or reconstruction
tooltip = 
manpage = If this option is specified, RAPTOR does not generate an aligned
stack or reconstruction.  It just returns a fiducial model with all the tracked
trajectories, like the bead tracker in IMOD.

[Field = xRay]
short = xray
type = B
usage = Remove strong features like straight edges to improve marker detection
tooltip = 
manpage = If the images contain strong straight line features (such as edges
of a capillary sample holder) they will affect the marker detection
process. Enter this option in order to remove these strong features and
improve marker detection performance.

[Field = Verbose]
short = verb
type = I
usage = Specify how much output RAPTOR should write and keep (0-2)
tooltip = 
manpage = Specify how much output RAPTOR should write and keep:
^  0 for minimal output. Only reconstructed volume and a minimal log file
are kept
^  1 for standard output (the default).  Aligned stack is kept as well as
fiducial model for IMOD and log with RAPTOR's progress.
^  2 for debug mode. RAPTOR writes an extended output log as well as status in
intermediate steps of the process. Useful to report and detect errors.

[SectionHeader = Advanced]
usage = Advanced Options 
manpage = Advanced Options
^  Use these options only if you have a good understanding of the algorithm
parameters.

[Field = MaxDistanceCandidate]
short = maxDist
type = I
usage = Max distance between markers in adjacent views that could be the same
marker
tooltip = 
manpage = Maximum distance between two markers in adjacent projections for
them to be considered as possibly the same marker in each separate projection.

[Field = MinNeighborsMRF]
short = minNeigh
type = I
usage = 
tooltip = Min # of neighbors per marker for graphical correspondence model
manpage = Minimum number of neighbors per marker to build the graphical model
when solving for the correspondence problem.

[Field = RollOffMRF]
short = rollOff
type = I
usage = Coefficient of exponential decay to penalize farther away markers
tooltip = 
manpage = Coefficient of the exponential decay to penalize markers that are
far away when establishing correspondences between projections
