[Field = AInputFile]
short = ainput
long = AInputFile
type = FN
usage = First file to compare
tooltip = 
manpage = First file to compare.  If this option
is not entered, the first non-option argument will be used for this input
file.

[Field = BInputFile]
short = binput
long = BInputFile
type = FN
usage = Second file to compare
tooltip = 
manpage = Second file to compare.  If this option
is not entered, the second non-option argument will be used for this input
file, if it exists.  If this file is
not specified at all, a backup file to A will be used (the A filename with ~ 
appended).

[Field = MaxDifferences]
short = max
long = MaxDifferences
type = FAM
usage = Maximum allowed difference for each column of input
tooltip = 
manpage = Maximum allowed difference for each column of input.  A difference
greater than the specified maximum for the particular column will cause the
program to exit with a non-zero status.  In addition, if the -big option is
selected, the two lines that differ will be printed.  The number of maximum
values entered determines how many columns are tested; columns past that 
number are ignored.  If the input files have multiple sections of numeric
data, this option can be entered multiple times to specify the limits for
each section.  If there are more numeric sections than entries, the last
entry of limits will be applied to the remaining sections.

[Field = GeneralFormat]
short = general
long = GeneralFormat
type = B
usage = Print maximum differences in general rather than fixed format
tooltip = 
manpage = Print maximum differences in general format (up to 6 numbers per
line, 5 decimal places, exponential notation for small or large numbers).
The default is to use a fixed format (f10.4) that allows up to 8 numbers per
line.

[Field = StripLinesWith]
short = strip 
long = StripLinesWith
type = CH
usage = Convert lines containing this text to numeric lines
tooltip = 
manpage = Convert lines containing the specified text to numeric lines.  This
entry allows one type of line with labeled numeric output to be converted into
pure numeric output and compared between the files.

[Field = BigDifferenceOutput]
short = big
long = BigDifferenceOutput
type = B
usage = Output the pair of input lines for differences above a maximum
tooltip = 
manpage = Output the pair of input lines whenever one of the differences 
is greater than the maximum difference specified with the -max option.

[Field = usage]
short = help
long = usage
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage =
