[Field = InputImageFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input image file with images to be normalized or with exposure data
tooltip =
manpage = Input file with images to be normalized, or whose header contains
the exposure data needed for scaling.  This entry is optional unless an output
image file is entered.
If the option is not entered and there is a non-option argument, the latter
will be used as the input file.

[Field = OutputImageFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output file for normalized images
tooltip =
manpage = Output file for normalized images.  If this option is not entered,
the second non-option argument will be used for this output file. 

[Field = WeightOutputFile]
short = weight
type = FN
usage = Output file with weighting factors (optional)
tooltip =
manpage = Output file with weighting factors that can be supplied to Tilt(1),
which can be either relative factors with a mean of 1 or factors that would
convert each image to transmittances.

[Field = ImagesWithExposures]
short = images
type = FN
usage = Image file with exposure information in header
tooltip =
manpage = Image file with exposure information in header.  Use this option to
specify a raw stack if the images to be normalized no longer have exposure
data in their header, such as would occur with montages. 

[Field = ReferenceImageFile]
short = rifile
type = FN
usage = File with a reference image of the blank beam
tooltip =
manpage = File with a reference image of the blank beam.  If the mean value
and the exposure for a reference image is known, then the exposure value for
each image can be used to scale the data to transmittances.

[Field = MeanOfReferenceImage]
short = rimean
type = F
usage = Mean value of a reference image for absolute normalization
tooltip =
manpage = Mean value of a reference image, which can be used for absolute
normalization to transmittances.  This option and the reference image file
cannot both be entered.

[Field = ExposureOfReferenceImage]
short = riexp
type = F
usage = Exposure time or electron dose for a reference image
tooltip =
manpage = Exposure time or electron dose of a reference image, which can be 
combined with the exposure values for each view to achieve absolute
normalization.  If this option is entered together with a reference image
file, the given value supercedes the exposure value in the header of the
reference image, if any.

[Field = LogOfOutput]
short = log
type = F
usage = Take log of output values after adding the given value
tooltip =
manpage = 

[Field = ModeOfOutput]
short = mode
type = I
usage = Mode of output file: 0 byte, 1/6 signed/unsigned integer, 2 float
tooltip =
manpage = Mode of output file: 0 for bytes (almost certainly useless), 1 for
signed 16-bit integers, 6 for unsigned 16-bit integers, or 2 for floating
point numbers.  The default is to use the mode of the input file.

[Field = ScalingFactor]
short = scale
type = F
usage = Factor for scaling the output after normalizing and taking log
tooltip =
manpage = Factor for scaling the output after data are normalized and the log
is taken.  If the mode of the output is 2, the default scale factor is 1
regardless of whether the log is being taken.  The scale is also 1 if there
is relative normalization without taking logs.  Otherwise, the scale factor
for logarithms is 5000, +/-10000, or +/-50 for modes 1, 6, or 0; the scale for
absolute linear normalizations is 25000, -50000, or -250 for modes 1, 6, or 0.
Negative scaling is needed to fit absolute normalized data into the unsigned
modes.

[Field = ReverseContrast]
short = reverse
type = B
usage = Reverse contrast from input data by using negative scaling
tooltip =
manpage = Reverse contrast from input data by using negative scaling.
With positive scaling, the values produced by the program will have the same
contrast polarity as the input, with density dark, but absolute normalization
will produce negative numbers.

[Field = IgnoreExposures]
short = ignore
type = B
usage = Ignore exposure data in image file when producing log output
tooltip =
manpage = Use this option if you just want to take the logarithm of the input
images without normalizing by exposure data in image file header.

[Field = ExposureFile]
short = expfile
type = FN
usage = File with an exposure value for each image
tooltip =
manpage = File with an exposure value for each image, one per line.  These
can be either electron doses, or exposure times if the beam intensity was
constant.

[Field = TiltFile]
short = tiltfile
type = FN
usage = File with tilt angles for using cosines as weights
tooltip =
manpage = File with tilt angles, one per line.  If this option is entered,
the program will compute normalization factors by assuming that the exposures 
were inversely proportional to the cosine of the tilt angle, possibly raised
to a power as specified by -power.

[Field = CosinePowerInverse]
short = power
type = I
usage = Inverse of power applied to cosine of tilt angle
tooltip =
manpage = When varying the exposure by the inverse of the cosine of the tilt
angle, SerialEM has an option to moderate the amount of exposure change by
taking this inverse to 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 or 1/5 power.  Use this option to specify
the selected power if normalization is being done with a tilt angle file.

[Field = MinimumLogFactor]
short = minlog
type = F
usage = Minimum fraction of dynamic range to allow when taking log
tooltip =
manpage = Minimum fraction of dynamic range to allow when taking the log. 
Before taking the log, small values will be truncated at this
fraction times the difference between the maximum and minimum of the input
file.  The default is 0.001, the same value that is used in Tilt(1) to prevent
small values from dominating the contrast range.

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.

[Field = usage]
short = help
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage =
