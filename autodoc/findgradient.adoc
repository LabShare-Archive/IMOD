[Field = ImageInputFile]
short = imin
type = FN
usage = Montaged image input file to be analyzed
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = PieceListInput]
short = plin
type = FN
usage = File with list of piece coordinates for image input file
tooltip = 
manpage = File with list of piece coordinates for image input file.

[Field = RootNameForFiles]
short = rootname
type = CH
usage = Root name for temporary files
tooltip = 
manpage = Root name for temporary files.  The program will append -fg and the
starting and ending section numbers to create the full root name.  This name
is used for the input parameter file (.param), files for image output and text
output from Blendmont (.imtmp and .out), and the files created by Blendmont
for edge functions (.xef, .yef) and edge correlations (.ecd).

[Field = DistortionField]
short = distort
type = FN
usage = Image distortion field file to use for undistorting images
tooltip = 
manpage = Image distortion field file to use for undistorting images.  The 
undistortion is applied when computing edge functions.

[Field = ImagesAreBinned]
short = imagebinned
type = I
usage = The current binning of the images
tooltip = 
manpage = The current binning of the images, so that the image distortion
field can be applied correctly.  This entry is required when doing image
distortion corrections unless
the program can determine the binning unambiguously from the image size.

[Field = GradientFile]
short  = gradient
type = FN
usage = File with base magnification gradients for each image
tooltip = 
manpage = File with magnification gradients for each section; the minimization
will determine the amounts to be added to these gradients.
This should be a file listing the tilt angle, the percent magnification change
per micron of Z height, and the degrees of rotation per micron of Z height
for each section, such as is produced by Extractmaggrad.

[Field = AdjustedFocus]
short = adjusted
type = B
usage = Focus was adjusted for changing Z height when montage was acquired
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = AddToGradient]
short = addgrad
type = FP
usage = Starting values for the mag and rotation gradients
tooltip =
manpage = This option provides starting values for the minimization.
The magnification gradient correction is specified by
two parameters: % of mag change per micron of Z height, and degrees of
rotation per micron of Z height.  If -gradient has been entered, the values
entered here will be treated as incremental to the values in the gradient file
for each section.  If -gradient has not been entered, the values entered here
will be used for all sections; but in this case the -geometry option must be
entered to provide additional information.

[Field = TiltGeometry]
short = geometry
type = FT
usage = Specify pixel size, tilt axis rotation angle, and tilt angle
tooltip =
manpage = This entry 
can be used in place of a gradient file to specify the 
pixel size in nanometers, tilt axis rotation angle, and tilt angle to be used
for the gradient computation.  The entry has no effect if a gradient file is
provided.

[Field = TiltFile]
short = tiltfile
type = FN
usage = File with tilt angles only (used if no mag gradient file)
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of file with tilt angles, one per line.  These angles will be
used only if there is no
mag gradient file to supply the tilt angles.

[Field = OffsetTilts]
short = offset
type = F
usage = Add given value to tilt angles from gradient or tilt file
tooltip =
manpage = Add the given value to the tilt angles from the gradient file or the
tilt file.  For a search of 1 or 3 parameters, this value will be used as the
starting value for finding the best offset.

[Field = SectionsToDo]
short = sections
type = LI
usage = Sections on which to minimize overlap errors
tooltip = 
manpage = List of sections on which to minimize overlap errors; comma-separated
ranges are allowed.  The mean error over all of these sections will be
minimized unless the -separate option is included, in which case the procedure
is run separately on each section.

[Field = RunSeparately]
short = separate
type = B
usage = Run minimization separately on each section
tooltip = 
manpage = Run minimization separately on each section, instead of combining
the errors from all sections.  With this option, the list of sections must be 
specified with -sections.

[Field = SearchType]
short = search
type = I
usage = 1/-1 to find tilt offset, 2/-2 to find gradient, 3 to find both
tooltip = 
manpage = Enter 1 or -1 to find just the tilt offset with a fixed mag
gradient, 2 or -2 to find the mag gradient with a fixed tilt offset, and 3 to
find both the mag gradient and the best tilt offset.  The latter should be
used only when multiple sections with a big difference in their tilt angles
are searched together (not separately).  The positive values do a search with
a simplex algorithm.  Use -2 to find gradients with a routine that uses an
estimated gradient from Blendmont to modify the gradient until it converges.
This method is faster and seems to be slightly more reliable.
Use -1 to search for the tilt offset with a simple routine that is faster
and probably as reliable as the simplex routine.

[Field = TraceOutput]
short = trace
type = I
usage = Output values during minimization: 1 for minima, 2 for all values
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = BlendOption]
short = blend
type = CHM
usage = Option and value to pass to Blendmont
tooltip = 
manpage = Option and value to pass to Blendmont.  This option will be added
the end of the .param file.  There is no check for whether options entered
this way conflict with the options placed into the .param file by findgradient.

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.

[Field = usage]
short = help
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage = Print help output.
