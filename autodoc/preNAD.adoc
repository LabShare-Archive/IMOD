Pip = 1

[Field = InputStack]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input image file with tilt projections
tooltip = 
manpage = Input image file with tilt projections. PreNAD algorithm will be
applied to this image.

[Field = OutputFileName]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output filtered image file
tooltip = 
manpage = Output filtered image file

[Field = AnglesFile]
short = angles
type = FN
usage = Tilt angles file
tooltip = 
manpage = File with tilt angles, one per line. This file has usually a .tlt
extension.

[Field = MaskedVarianceDifference]
short = MVD
type = F
usage = User-defined Masked Variance Difference (MVD)
tooltip = 
manpage =  User-defined Masked Variance Difference (MVD). MVD is an
image-dependent parameter which defines a stopping condition for preNAD. The
user-defined MVD is optional. However, generic users are suggested to ignore
this parameter and use MinIterations/MaxIterations for an automatic estimation
of the MVD.


[Field = sigma]
short = s
type = F
usage = Initial sigma for smoothing structure tensor (in pixels, default 1)
tooltip = 
manpage = Initial sigma for smoothing the structure tensor (in pixels).
Default initial sigma is 1 pixel.

[Field = MinIterations]
short = minite
type = I
usage = Minimum Number of Iterations
tooltip = 
manpage =  Minimum Number of Iterations allowed for each tilt projection.


[Field = MaxIterations]
short = maxite
type = I
usage = Maximum Number of Iterations
tooltip = 
manpage =  Maximum Number of Iterations allowed for each tilt projection.


[Field = ViewsToProcess]
short = views
type = LI
usage = List of views to process from input file, numbered from 1.
tooltip =  
manpage = List of views to process from input file, numbered from 1. List
should be in the form 1,3-6,9,19.
