[Field = InputFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input model file
tooltip = 
manpage = Input model file.  If this option
is not entered, the first non-option argument will be used for the input
file.

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output text file for points
tooltip = 
manpage = Output text file for points.  If this option
is not entered, the second non-option argument will be used for the output
file.

[Field = FloatingPoint]
short = float
type = B
usage = Output model coordinates as floating point, not integer
tooltip = 
manpage = Output model coordinates as floating point; otherwise the nearest 
integer value is output.

[Field = ScaledCoordinates]
short = scaled
type = B
usage = Output coordinates in model coordinate system, not as pixel indices
tooltip = 
manpage = Output coordinates in model coordinate system, scaled by the pixel
size and offset by origin values.  The default is to output index coordinates
corresponding to the pixel coordinates in the image.

[Field = ObjectAndContour]
short = object
type = B
usage = Output object and contour numbers for each point (numbered from 1)
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = Contour]
short = contour
type = B
usage = Output contour number for each point (numbered from 1)
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = NumberedFromZero]
short = zero
type = B
usage = Output object and contour numbers starting from 0 instead of 1
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = ValuesInLastColumn]
short = values
type = I
usage = 1 or -1 to output point or contour value as last number on line
tooltip = 
manpage = Enter 1 to output general point values as the last number on each
line, after the Z coordinate, or -1 to output general contour values for the
first point in each contour.  A point file with either format can be read back
in by Point2model(1), provided that the -values option is given to that
program.  When a point or contour has no stored value, a value of 0 will be
output, unless a different value is specified with the -fill option.

[Field = FillValue]
short = fill
type = F
usage = Value to output when contour/point has no stored value (default 0)
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = usage]
short = help
long = usage
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage = Print help output.
