[Field = InputFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input model file
tooltip = 
manpage = Input model file.  If this option is not entered, the first
non-optional argument will be used.

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output model file
tooltip = 
manpage = Output model file.  If this option is not entered, the second
non-optional argument will be used.

[Field = OldZList]
short = old
type = LI
usage = List of Z values to remap
tooltip = 
manpage = List of Z values in the input model that are to be remapped.  The 
default is the actual list of Z values, which could have gaps that make it
difficult to compose the list of values to map to.

[Field = FullRangeInZ]
short = full
type = B
usage = Use range from 0 to maximum Z in model header as old list
tooltip = 
manpage = For the list of values to remap, use the complete range from 0 to
NZ-1, where NZ is the Z size of the image file that the model was last loaded
on, determined from the model header.

[Field = NewZList]
short = new
type = LI
usage = List of Z values to map old list to
tooltip = 
manpage = List of Z values to map old list to.  There must be as many values
in this list as in the list of Z values to remap.  See notes above on the
contents of this list.

[Field = AddToAllPoints]
short = add
type = FT
usage = Amount to add to all coordinates in X, Y, and Z, after remapping
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = ReorderPointsInZ]
short = reorder
type = I
usage = Make points be monotonically increasing (1) or decreasing (-1) in Z
tooltip = 
manpage = Go through each contour and reorder the points so that they are
monotonically increasing in Z (for an input value of 1) or monotonically
decreasing (for a value of -1)

[Field = FromChunkLimits]
short = fromchunks
type = IA
usage = Starting and ending slices in old serial tomogram join
tooltip = 
manpage = To remap Z values after changing the spacing between sections in a
joined set of serial section tomograms, enter the original starting and ending
slice for each tomogram in the join (start1, end1, start2, end2, etc).  If a
tomogram was inverted in the join, be sure that the high Z number is listed as
the start and the low Z number is listed as the end.

[Field = ToChunkLimits]
short = tochunks
type = IA
usage = Starting and ending slices in new serial tomogram join
tooltip = 
manpage = The new starting and ending slices for each tomogram in a serial
section join, in the same format as for -fromchunks.  When these two options
are entered, none of the other mapping options (-old, -new, -full) can be used.

[Field = usage]
short = help
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage = Print help output.
