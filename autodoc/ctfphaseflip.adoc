[Field = InputStack]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input stack that will be corrected
tooltip =
manpage = 

[Field = OutputFileName]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Name of output file for the corrected views
tooltip =
manpage = 

[Field = AngleFile]
short = angleFn
type =  FN
usage = File containing tilt angles for the input stack
tooltip =
manpage = File containing tilt angles for the input stack.  Each line of this
file is the tilt angle for a view of the input stack.  The angles are listed
in order starting from view 1.

[Field = InvertTiltAngles]
short = invert
type = B
usage = Invert the sign of the tilt angles
tooltip =
manpage = Invert the sign of the tilt angles to compensate for a left-handed 
coordinate system in the microscope.  When the sign of the tilt angles and 
the value of the tilt axis rotation angle are such that reconstructions are
generated with inverted handedness, then this option is needed for a proper
correction.    One way to assess this need is to examine the aligned stack
being corrected, which has its tilt axis vertical.  At positive tilt angles,
the right side of the images should be more underfocused than the left side;
if not, then this option is needed.

[Field = DefocusFile]
short = defFn
type = FN
usage = File with list of tilt angle ranges and defocus values in nanometers
tooltip =
manpage = File with list of tilt angle ranges and defocus values in
nanometers, such as was output by ctfplotter(1).  Each line should have a
starting and ending view number (numbered from 1), a starting and ending tilt
angle, and a defocus value.  Defocus is in nanometers, with positive values for
underfocus.  The program will assign that defocus value to the
midpoint of the range of views.  For a view at a given tilt
angle, it will find the defocus either by interpolating between two
surrounding midpoint angles, if there are such angles, or by taking the nearest
defocus value, if the angle is beyond the range of the available midpoint
angles.  To correct a tilt series with a single value of defocus, supply a
file with a single line containing "20 20 0. 0. defocus_value".  If you prepare
a defocus file with more than line, be sure to use the exact angles from the
tilt angle file specified with the -angleFn option; do not round to one
decimal place.  Alternatively, add the number "2" as an extra value at the end
of the first line of the file; this will prevent the program from thinking
that the view numbers might be off by one.

[Field = TransformFile]
short = xform
type = FN
usage = File with linear transformations used to align images
tooltip = 
manpage = File with the linear transformations that were used to align the
images.  With this option, the program will use the shifts in X to adjust the
middle position that is considered to be at the nominal defocus value for each
image.  Whether this is appropriate or not needs to be determined by
experimentation.

[Field = DefocusTol]
short = defTol
type = I
usage =  Defocus tolerance in nanometers limiting the strip width
tooltip =
manpage =  Defocus tolerance in nanometers that limits the width of the strips.
An image region
with defocus difference less than this tolerance 
is considered to have constant defocus and can be corrected as one strip. The
strip width is either the width of this region or the maxmimum strip width
(256 pixels by default), whichever is smaller; but strips will also be
constrained to be at least 128 pixels wide.  Each strip is corrected based on
the defocus at the center of the strip. 

[Field = MaximumStripWidth]
short = maxWidth
type = I
usage = Maximum width of strips in pixels (default 256)
tooltip =
manpage = Maximum width of strips in pixels.  At lower tilts, the strip width will be
constrained by this limit even though the defocus tolerance would allow a
wider strip.  This speeds up the computation and may give somewhat more
accurate correction since the range of defocus in a strip is less, but
gives artifactually low amplitudes in the Fourier transform right at the zeros
of the CTF.  Setting the width higher (e.g., half the image size) can
virtually eliminate this effect at lower tilts. 

[Field = InterpolationWidth]
short = iWidth
type = I
usage = The distance in pixels between two consecutive strips  
tooltip =
manpage = The distance in pixels between the center lines of two consecutive 
strips. A pixel inside the region between those two center lines resides in
both strips. As the two strips are corrected separately, that pixel will have 2
corrected values. The final value for that pixel is a linear interpolation of
the 2 corrected values. 

[Field = PixelSize]
short = pixelSize
type = F
usage = Image pixel size in nanometers
tooltip =
manpage = Image pixel size in nanometers

[Field = Voltage]
short = volt
type = I
usage =  Microscope voltage in kV
tooltip =
manpage =  Microscope voltage in kV

[Field = SphericalAberration]
short = cs
type = F
usage = Microscope spherical aberration in millimeters
tooltip =
manpage = Microscope spherical aberration in millimeters.  A value of 0 can be
entered; it will be made slightly larger to prevent division by 0 in the CTF
equations.

[Field = AmplitudeContrast]
short = ampContrast
type = F
usage = The fraction of amplitude contrast
tooltip =
manpage = The fraction of amplitude contrast. For Cryo-EM, 
it should be between 0.07 and 0.14.  The value should be the same as was used
when detecting the defocus.

[Field = StartingEndingViews]
short = views
type = IP
usage = The starting and ending views to correct (numbered from 1)
tooltip =
manpage = The starting view and the ending view to correct in this run
of the program, numbered from 1.  This is
an optional field.  The default is to correct all views in the input stack.

[Field = TotalViews]
short = totalViews
type = IP
usage = The starting and ending views that need to be corrected in all
parallel runs of the program.
tooltip =
manpage = The starting view and the ending view that need to be corrected in
all parallel runs of the program.  This field is only needed when doing
parallel runs with direct writing to a single output file.  The program is
run initially with a StartingEndingViews entry of -1,-1 to set up the output
file.  Then it is run with actual starting and ending views for each parallel
run, and each run writes to the existing output file.

[Field = BoundaryInfoFile]
short = boundary
type = FN
usage = Name of file with information about boundaries for parallel writing
tooltip =
manpage = Name of file with information about boundaries between chunks and
files in which to write lines at the boundaries, when multiple runs are 
writing in parallel to an output file.

[Field = AxisAngle]
short = aAngle 
type = F
usage = This option is not supported 
tooltip =
manpage = This option is not supported.  The tilt axis has to be vertical,
i.e., to be coincident with the Y axis.  Usually this means the input stack
has to be the aligned stack.

[Field = Parameter]
short = param
type = PF 
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries from this file.
