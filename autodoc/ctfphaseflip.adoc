[Field = Parameter]
short = param
type = PF 
usage = specifies a parameter file
tooltip = 
manpage =

[Field = InputStack]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input stack that will be corrected
tooltip =
manpage = Input stack that will be corrected

[Field = AngleFile]
short = angleFn
type =  FN
usage = File contains tilt angles for the input stack
tooltip =
manpage = Each line of this file is the tilt angle for a slice of the input
stack. The angles are listed in order starting from slice 1.

[Field = AxisAngle]
short = aAngle 
type = F
usage = This option is not supported 
tooltip =
manpage = This option is not supported. The tilt axis has to be vertical, i.e.,
to be coincident with the Y axis. Usually this means the input stack has to be
the aligned stack.

[Field = DefocusTol]
short = defTol
type = I
usage =  Defocus tolerance in nanometers defines the strips
tooltip =
manpage =  Defocus tolerance in nanometers defines the strips. An image region
with defocus difference less than this tolerance is defined as a strip 
and is considered to have constant defocus. Each strip is
corrected with the defocus at the center of the strip.

[Field = InterpolationWidth]
short = iWidth
type = I
usage = The distance in pixels between two consecutive strips  
tooltip =
manpage = The distance in pixels between the center lines of two consecutive 
strips. A pixel inside the region between those two center lines resides in
both strips. As the two strips are corrected seperately, that pixel will have 2
corrected values. The final value for that pixel is a linear interpolation of
the 2 corrected values. 

[Field = PixelSize]
short = pixelSize
type = F
usage = Image pixel size in nanometers
tooltip =
manpage = Image pixel size in nanometers

[Field = Voltage]
short = volt
type = I
usage =  Microscope voltage in Kv
tooltip =
manpage =  Microscope voltage in Kv

[Field = SphericalAberration]
short = cs
type = F
usage = Microscope spherical aberration in millimeters
tooltip =
manpage = Microscope spherical aberration in millimeters

[Field = AmplitudeContrast]
short = ampContrast
type = F
usage = The percentage of amplitude contrast
tooltip =
manpage = The percentage of amplitude contrast. For Cryo-EM, 
it should be between 0.07 and 0.14

[Field = DefocusFile]
short = defFn
type = FN
usage = A file stores the defocus value in nanometers
tooltip =
manpage = A file stores the defocus value in nanometers. This is an optional
field. The default is the root stack filename with .defocus appended.

[Field = StartingEndingViews]
short = views
type = IP
usage = The starting slice and the ending slice need to be corrected for one run
of the program.
tooltip =
manpage = The starting slice and the ending slice need to be corrected for one
run of the program. This is
an optional field. The default is all the slices in the input stack.

[Field = TotalViews]
short = totalViews
type = IP
usage = The starting slice and the ending slice need to be corrected in all
parallel runs of the program.
tooltip =
manpage = The starting slice and the ending slice need to be corrected in all
parallel runs of the program . This field is only needed when doing parallel
runs.

[Field = OutputFileName]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output file name to store the corrected slices
tooltip =
manpage = Output file name to store the corrected slices
