[Field = InputFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input file with f transforms 
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = GOutputFile]
short = goutput
type = FN
usage = Output file for g transforms (optional if input name ends in xf)
tooltip = 
manpage = Output file for g transforms.  If an output filename is omitted
and the input filename ends in xf, the input filename will be used as output
with the last letter converted from f to g.

[Field = NumberToFit]
short = nfit
type = I
usage = Number of adjacent sections to fit, 0 for global alignment, or 1 for
fit to all sections
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = ReferenceSection]
short = ref
type = I
usage = Do a global alignment to the given section (numbered from 1)
tooltip = 
manpage = Do a global alignment to the given section; this will give the
reference section a unit transform and keep it from being transformed.
Sections are numbered from 1.

[Field = OrderOfPolynomialFit]
short = order
type = I
usage = Order of the polynomial fit to the data. The default is 1 (linear fit).
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = HybridFits]
short = mixed
type = I
usage = Number of parameters to eliminate trends for with a hybrid alignment
tooltip = 
manpage = Number of parameters to eliminate trends for with a hybrid alignment:
2 for translations only, 3 for rotations also, 4 for size changes also.

[Field = RangeOfAnglesInAverage]
short = range
type = F
usage = Range of rotation angles for sections to include in average and fits
tooltip = 
manpage = Compute the global average center position, and the center position
for local fits, using the largest group of sections whose rotation angles fall
within the given range.

[Field = RobustFit]
short = robust
type = B
usage = Use robust weighting when fitting to find center position
tooltip = 
manpage = Use robust weighting when fitting to find the center position.  The
fits will be done iteratively, with a weight assigned to each point in the fit
and the weight adjusted after each iteration based on the fitting error of
that point.  Weights are adjusted together in a fit to the four
rotation/magnification parameters, and independently adjusted in a separate
fit to the X and Y shift values.

[Field = KFactorScaling]
short = kfactor
type = I
usage = Amount to scale the K factor that controls how many points are down-weighted
tooltip = 
manpage = Amount to scale the K factor that controls how many points are
down-weighted in the robust fitting.  The default scaling of 1 gives a K
factor of 4.685, the factor commonly used for the Tukey bisquare weighting.  A
smaller factor will down-weight and eliminate more points.

[Field = MaximumIterations]
short = max
type = I
usage = Maximum iterations in robust fitting (default 200, negative for trace)
tooltip = 
manpage = The maximum number of iterations in the robust fitting.  The default
is 200.  A negative number can be entered to obtain output about the changes
in weights after each iteration.

[Field = IterationParams]
short = iteration
type = FT
usage = Max fraction with zero weights, max change in weight without
and with oscillations
tooltip = 
manpage = This option sets three values that control the robust fitting: (1)
The maximum fraction of points that are allowed to have zero weight.  The
actual limit for a particular fit is the nearest integer of this value times
the number of points being fit.  The
default is 0.2.  (2) The maximum change in weights allowed before considering
that a fit has converged, if the fit is not oscillating between two states.  
The default is 0.02.  (3) The maximum change in weights allowed for terminating
the fit if it is oscillating between two states; the change in weights in
one state must also be less than the maximum described in (2).  The default is
0.04.

[Field = usage]
short = help
long = usage
type = B
usage = Print help output
