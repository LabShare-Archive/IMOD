[Field = InputFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input file with f transforms 
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = GOutputFile]
short = goutput
type = FN
usage = Output file for g transforms (optional if input name ends in xf)
tooltip = 
manpage = Output file for g transforms.  If an output filename is omitted
and the input filename ends in xf, the input filename will be used as output
with the last letter converted from f to g.

[Field = NumberToFit]
short = nfit
type = I
usage = Number of adjacent sections to fit, 0 for global alignment, or 1 for
fit to all sections
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = ReferenceSection]
short = ref
type = I
usage = Do a global alignment to the given section (numbered from 1)
tooltip = 
manpage = Do a global alignment to the given section; this will give the
reference section a unit transform and keep it from being transformed.
Sections are numbered from 1.

[Field = OrderOfPolynomialFit]
short = order
type = I
usage = Order of the polynomial fit to the data. The default is 1 (linear fit).
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = HybridFits]
short = mixed
type = I
usage = Number of parameters to eliminate trends for with a hybrid alignment
tooltip = 
manpage = Number of parameters to eliminate trends for with a hybrid alignment:
2 for translations only, 3 for rotations also, 4 for size changes also.

[Field = RangeOfAnglesInAverage]
short = range
type = F
usage = Range of rotation angles for sections to include in average and fits
tooltip = 
manpage = Compute the global average center position, and the center position
for local fits, using the largest group of sections whose rotation angles fall
within the given range.

[Field = usage]
short = help
long = usage
type = B
usage = Print help output
