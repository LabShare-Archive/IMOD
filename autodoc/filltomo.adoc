[Field = MatchedToTomogram]
short = matched
type = FN
usage = Tomogram that was matched to, source of pixels used for filling
tooltip =
manpage = Tomogram that was matched to, typically "...a.rec" when matching the
B to the A axis.  This tomogram is the source of pixels used for replacement.
This input file is required.  If this option is not entered, the first
non-option argument will be used for the filename.

[Field = FillTomogram]
short = fill
type = FN
usage = Tomogram to fill with pixels from the tomogram that was matched to
tooltip =
manpage = Transformed or combined tomogram to fill with pixels from the
tomogram that was matched to, typically named "...b.mat" (when matching B to A) or
"sum.rec", respectively.  This output file is required.  If this option is not
entered, the second non-option argument will be used for the filename.  This
file must have the same dimensions as the tomogram that was matched to.

[Field = SourceTomogram]
short = source
type = CH
usage = File name of source for transformed tomogram
tooltip =
manpage = Name of tomogram that was transformed to produce a matching tomogram,
typically named "...b.rec" when matching B to A.  This entry is required.

[Field = InverseTransformFile]
short = inverse
type = FN
usage = File with inverse of transform applied to produce matching tomogram
tooltip =
manpage = File with inverse of 3D transform applied to produce matching
tomogram.  This file is typically named "inverse.xf" and is produced when
Refinematch(1) is run by Matchorwarp(1).  This entry is required.

[Field = LeftRightFill]
short = xfill
type = IP
usage = Number of pixels to fill regardless on left and right sides of tomogram
tooltip =
manpage = 

[Field = BottomTopFill]
short = yfill
type = IP
usage = Number of pixels to fill regardless on bottom and top sides of tomogram
tooltip =
manpage = 

[Field = ImagesAreBinned]
short = binning
type = I
usage = The binning of the tomograms relative to the original data (default 1)
tooltip = 
manpage = The binning of the aligned images used to beuild the tomomgrams,
relative to the original data.  The default is 1.  This entry is needed if
options specifying stack transforms are entered with unbinned sizes and
binning was not 1. 

[Field = SourceRawStackSize]
short = sraw
type = IT
usage = Size in X, Y, and Z of the raw tilt series for transformed tomogram
tooltip =
manpage = Size in X, Y, and Z of the unaligned tilt series used to
build the tomogram that was transformed to match.  If images were binned to
make the aligned stack, either enter a binned size here, or enter an
unbinned size and the -binning option.  This entry is required if
-sxform is entered.  

[Field = SourceStackTransforms]
short = sxform
type = FN
usage = File of transforms applied to align tilt series for transformed tomogram
tooltip =
manpage = File of 2D transforms applied to align the tilt series images used
to build the tomogram that was transformed to match.  With this option, the
program will replace pixels that come from regions where there was not
complete projection data available for backprojection.

[Field = SourceBoundaryModel]
short = sboundary
type = FN
usage = Model with boundary contour drawn on source for transformed tomogram
tooltip =
manpage = File with model drawn on the tomogram that was transformed to match,
where the boundary contour indicates the region where data are good, and
outside which data should be replaced.  This option cannot be used together
with -sxform.  If there is more than one contour, the one closest to the
midplane of the tomogram is used.

[Field = MatchedToRawStackSize]
short = mraw
type = IT
usage = Size in X, Y, and Z of the raw tilt series for matched-to tomogram
tooltip =
manpage = Size in X, Y, and Z of the unaligned tilt series used to
build the tomogram that was matched.  Enter either a size adjusted for
binning, or the unbinned size along with the -binning option.  This entry is
required if -mxform is entered.

[Field = MatchedToStackTransforms]
short = mxform
type = FN
usage = File of transforms applied to align tilt series for matched-to tomogram
tooltip =
manpage = File of 2D transforms applied to align the tilt series images used
to build the tomogram that was matched to.  With this option, the
program will refrain from using replacement pixels from regions where there was not
complete projection data available for backprojection, unless they are inside
edge regions to be filled regardless (set by -xfill and -yfill options).

[Field = MatchedToBoundaryModel]
short = mboundary
type = FN
usage = Model with boundary contour drawn on tomogram that was matched to
tooltip =
manpage = File with model drawn on the tomogram that was matched to,
where the boundary contour indicates the region where data are good, and
outside of which data should be not be used for replacement.  Pixels inside of
edge regions set by -xfill and -yfill options will still be replaced.
This option cannot be used together
with -mxform.  If there is more than one contour, the one closest to the
midplane of the tomogram is used.

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.

[Field = usage]
short = help
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage =
