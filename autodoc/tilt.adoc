[Field = InputProjections]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input image file with aligned projections
tooltip = 
manpage = Input image file with aligned projections.  If this option is not
entered, the first non-option argument is taken as the input name.

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output file for reconstruction or reprojection
tooltip = 
manpage = Output file for reconstruction or reprojection.  If this option is
not entered, the second non-option argument is taken as the output name. 

[Field = RecFileToReproject]
short = recfile
type = FN
usage = Reconstruction file to reproject or run SIRT with
tooltip = 
manpage = Reconstruction file to reproject or run SIRT with.  When using this
option, all of the entries to the program used when building this
reconstruction should be included as well.

[Field = ProjectModel]
type = FN
usage = Model file with point positions to reproject (output is a model)
tooltip = 
manpage = Model file with point positions to reproject onto the projection
images.  The output file will be a model.  All of the other parameter entries
should be the same as were used for generating the tomogram upon which the 
model was built.  Points will be output only for the views included in that
tomogram.  The model header will be set so that the model will display
properly on both the aligned stack used to generate the tomogram and on
aligned stacks at other binnings.

[Field = BaseRecFile]
type = FN
usage = Previous reconstruction file to add to or subtract from
tooltip = 
manpage = Previous reconstruction file to add views to or subtract views from.
One use for this option is to compute a series reconstructions quickly with
different views left out.  The BaseNumViews option must also be entered in
order for the right scaling to be set up when reading in the existing
reconstruction and writing out the new one (unless -1 is entered for
SubtractFromBase).  If the WeightAngleFile option is
also used, then incremental reconstructions computed in this way should match
reconstructions computed de novo very closely.  If the input projection file
contains only the views being added or subtracted, then you should also use
the MinMaxMean option to keep fill values constant.

[Field = ActionIfGPUFails]
type = IP
usage = 0 for no action, 1 for warning, 2 for error if GPU cannot be used
tooltip = 
manpage = The action to take when the GPU cannot be used after being
requested: 0 to no action, 1 to issue a warning prefixed with MESSAGE:, and 2
to exit with an error.  Enter 2 numbers: the first for the action when the GPU
is requested by the UseGPU option; the second for the action when the GPU is
requested only by the environment variable IMOD_USE_GPU, or by the variable
IMOD_USE_GPU2.

[Field = AdjustOrigin]
type = B
usage = Adjust origin for shifts and size changes
tooltip = 
manpage = Adjust origin for shifts with the SHIFT option and size changes
with WIDTH and SLICES, and base the origin on that of the aligned stack.  With
this option, reconstructions in PERPENDICULAR mode of different size and
location will have congruent coordinate systems and will load models
interchangeably.  In addition, reconstructions from different sized projection
stacks will have congruent coordinates provided that the origin was adjusted
when making the projection stack (e.g., with the -origin option to
Newstack(1)).  The default is to produce legacy origin values that are not
adjusted for these operations, with the origin in X and Y in the center of the
volume.

[Field = ANGLES]
type = FAM
usage = Tilt angles of the views
tooltip = 
manpage = Use this entry to specify the tilt angles of the views if they are
not in a separate file.  You must enter one tilt
angle for each view.  Use more than one ANGLES entry if necessary.
This information will override tilt angles specified in the file
header.  If you enter angles in this way, the file header need not
contain tilt information.

[Field = BaseNumViews]
type = I
usage = Number of views in previous reconstruction
tooltip = 
manpage = When adding or subtracting views from a base reconstruction, this
option must be entered with the number of views in the previous
reconstruction.  However, if the SubtractFromBase option is entered with a -1
to indicate that a reconstruction is to be subtracted from a base file for
SIRT, this option should not be entered.

[Field = BoundaryInfoFile]
type = FN
usage = File with information about boundaries when writing in parallel
tooltip = 
manpage = File with information about boundary locations and files when 
directly writing in parallel to a single output file.

[Field = COMPFRACTION]
type = F
usage = Fraction of distance over which compression occurred
tooltip = 
manpage = If the compression measured by TILTALIGN occurred over
only a fraction of the distance between the fiducials, enter the fraction with
this option.

[Field = COMPRESS]
type = FAM
usage = Compression factors of the views
tooltip = 
manpage = With this entry, the program will assume that the section has
compressed in Z by the amount given by the amount given for each
view.  The compressions would be taken directly from the  output of
TILTALIGN for incremental compression.  A value must be entered for
each view.

[Field = ConstrainSign]
type = I
usage = Constrain sign of net output for SIRT to positive (1) or negative (-1)
tooltip = 
manpage = Enter -1 or 1 to constrain the result to negative or positive when
subtracting a reconstruction from a base reconstruction, or when subtracting
an error reconstruction from the current slice with SIRT internally.

[Field = COSINTERP]
type = IA
usage = Interpolation order and sampling factor for cosine stretching
tooltip = 
manpage = Interpolation order and sampling factor
for cosine stretching of the input data.  The order can be 1 for linear,
2 for quadratic, 3 for cubic, or 0 to disable cosine stretching.
The default is linear to provide some smoothing of the data; higher
orders are appropriate if data are relatively noise-free.  The factor is
optional; the default is 2, which prevents further smoothing when
the stretched data are linearly interpolated during backprojection.  

[Field = DENSWEIGHT]
type = FA
usage = Weighting to compute local average tilt increment
tooltip = 
manpage = Use this entry to control the weighting of each view proportional
to the local average tilt increment between views.  The first value specifies
the number of intervals on EACH side of a view to consider; the default
is 2, and a value of 0 disables weighting.  Optionally, this value may be
followed by that number of weights to be applied in averaging the adjacent
increments (the default is equal weighting).

[Field = DONE]
type = B
usage = Terminate input to program
tooltip = 
manpage = The entry is equivalent to EndInput, and lines of input following
it will be ignored.  This option is provided for compatibility with old
command files, but eTomo does not handle it properly, so it should not be used.

[Field = EXCLUDELIST2]
type = LIM
usage = List of views to exclude (comma-separated ranges allowed)
tooltip = 
manpage = List of views to be excluded from the reconstruction, numbered from 
1.  The list
can consist of individual view numbers, or of ranges (e.g., 1-4), separated
by commas or spaces.  The EXCLUDE and EXCLUDELIST entries available in
old versions of the program are treated as this option.
You may have any number of entries with exclude lists, but they cannot be 
combined with INCLUDE entries.

[Field = FlatFilterFraction]
type = F
usage = Fraction of constant filter to mix with R-weighting, or > 1 for SIRT
tooltip = 
manpage = With a value entered between 0 and 1, the radial filter will be set
up as a linear combination of the standard R-weighting filter and a flat
filter, which will greatly overemphasize low frequencies.  The entered value
is the fraction for the flat filter.  The flat filter is scaled to give
output densities roughly comparable to those obtained with the R-weighting
filter.  The zero-frequency component of each filter is 0.2 times the
component at the lowest non-zero frequency.  If the value is greater than one,
a filter suitable for Simultaneous Iterative Reconstruction (SIRT) is set up,
scaled so as to distribute input values equally along each ray.  The
zero-frequency component is the same as the other components in this case.

[Field = FBPINTERP]
type = I
usage = This option was discontinued in IMOD 4.0.20
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = FULLIMAGE]
type = IP
usage = Full size of original, unaligned images
tooltip = 
manpage = Use this entry to specify the full size in X and Y of the
original stack of tilted views, so that a subset of the aligned
stack can be handled properly when using a global X-axis tilt or
local alignments.

[Field = IMAGEBINNED]
type = I
usage = Binning of input images
tooltip = 
manpage = If the input images have been binned, this entry can be entered to
specify the binning and have various other dimensions scaled down by
this factor.  Values entered with SHIFT, OFFSET, THICKNESS, WIDTH,
FULLIMAGESIZE, SLICE, and SUBSETSTART will be scaled.  These entries
thus do not need to be changed when the input binning is changed.

[Field = INCLUDE]
type = LIM
usage = List of views to include in the reconstruction
tooltip = 
manpage = A subset of views to be used for the
reconstruction, numbered from 1.  The values can be individual view numbers or
ranges, separated by spaces or commas.  Use more than one INCLUDE entry if the
numbers do not all fit on one line.

[Field = LOCALFILE]
type = FN
usage = File with local tilt alignment information
tooltip = 
manpage = File containing local tilt alignment information.

[Field = LOCALSCALE]
type = F
usage = Factor by which images were scaled relative to local alignment data
tooltip = 
manpage = If local tilt alignments were obtained from unreduced data, but the
aligned stack was reduced by binning or transforming, use this entry
to specify the factor by which the data were scaled, so that the
local alignment information can be adjusted.  Without this entry, the program
will use the ratio of the pixel size at which local alignments were computed
to the pixel size of the aligned images, which should be correct
if data were binned.

[Field = LOG]
type = F
usage = Take the logarithm after adding the given base value
tooltip = 
manpage = This entry allows one to generate a reconstruction using the
logarithm of the densities in the input file, with the entered value 
added before taking the logarithm.

[Field = MASK]
type = I
usage = Mask regions with incomplete data; value is extra pixels to mask
tooltip = 
manpage = This entry allows a mask to be applied so as to exclude from the
reconstructed volume those parts which lie outside the volume for
which the projection data are complete.  This volume is a cylinder whose axis
lies along the tilt axis.  The entered value specifies the number of extra
pixels to mask out in this way; a negative value can be used to set the mask
farther out.  Inside the masked area, densities are smoothly tapered from the
value of a pixel at the edge of the area down to the mean value at the edge.
This masking is needed to prevent artifacts from building up at the edges of
the slice during iterations with SIRT.

[Field = MinMaxMean]
type = IT
usage = Min, max, and mean densities to use instead of input file values
tooltip = 
manpage = Min, max, and mean densities to use instead of values in the
input projection file.  Use this entry to keep the fill value used for
back projecting from outside the data constant when doing incremental
reconstruction with a projection file that contains only the views being added
or subtracted.

[Field = MODE]
type = I
usage = Output file mode (default 2)
tooltip = 
manpage = This entry allows one to specify the data mode of the output file,
which is 2 by default.  Be sure to use an appropriate SCALE entry so
that data will be scaled to the proper range.

[Field = OFFSET]
type = FA
usage = Offsets for tilt angles and tilt axis
tooltip = 
manpage = This entry can contain two numbers, DELANG and DELXX.  An offset of
DELANG degrees will be applied to all tilt angles.  DELANG positive rotates
reconstructed sections anticlockwise.  A DELXX entry indicates that the tilt
axis would be offset in a stack of full-sized projection images, cutting the
X-axis at  NX/2. + DELXX instead of NX/2.  The DELXX entry is optional and
defaults to 0 when omitted.  If the tilt axis is offset from the center
because the projection images are a non-centered subset of the full images,
use the SUBSETSTART entry instead.  If the projection images are a
non-centered subset with the tilt axis centered in them, then using this entry
together with SUBSETSTART and FULLIMAGE should produce a correct result.

[Field = PARALLEL]
type = B
usage = Output slices parallel to the plane of the specimen, inverting handedness
tooltip = 
manpage = Output slices parallel to the plane of the zero tilt projection.
This option cannot be used with direct writing of data to a single output file
from parallelized Tilt runs.  It inverts the handedness of the reconstruction.

[Field = PERPENDICULAR]
type = B
usage = Output slices perpendicular to the plane of the specimen (default)
tooltip = 
manpage = Output slices perpendicular to the plane of the specimen.  This
output is the default since it corresponds to the way in which slices are
computed and allows efficient computation of chunks in parallel.

[Field = RADIAL]
type = FP
usage = Cutoff and sigma of Gaussian falloff for radial weighting function.
tooltip = 
manpage = This entry controls low-pass filtering with the radial weighting
function.  The radial weighting function is linear away from the origin out to
the distance in reciprocal space specified by the first value, followed by a 
Gaussian fall-off with a s.d. (sigma) given by the second value.  If the
cutoff is great than 1 the distances are interpreted as pixels in Fourier
space; otherwise they are treated as frequencies in cycles/pixel, which range
from 0 to 0.5.

[Field = REPLICATE]
type = FPM
usage = This option was discontinued in IMOD 4.0.21
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = REPROJECT]
type = FAM
usage = Angles for reprojections of reconstructed slices
tooltip = 
manpage = With this entry, the program will output one or more reprojections 
of the reconstructed slices at the given angles.  If RecFileToReproject is 
entered, then the reprojections should match the input projections; otherwise
the reprojections will be of the computed slices and should match what
Xyzproj(1) would produce.

[Field = RotateBy90]
type = B
usage = Output slices parallel to the plane of the specimen without inverting
handedness
tooltip = 
manpage = Output slices parallel to the plane of the zero tilt projection, but
in the proper order to avoid inverting handedness.
This option cannot be used with direct writing of data to a single output file
from parallelized Tilt runs.

[Field = SCALE]
type = FP
usage = Values to add then scale reconstructed densities by
tooltip = 
manpage = With this entry, the values in the reconstruction will be scaled by
adding the first value then multiplying by the second one.  The default is
0,1.  After the reconstruction is complete, the program will output the
scale values that would make the data range from 10 to 245.

[Field = SHIFT]
type = FA
usage = Amount to shift reconstructed slice in X and Y
tooltip = 
manpage = This entry allows one to shift the reconstructed slice in X or Z
before it is output.  If the X shift is positive, the slice will be
shifted to the right, and the output will contain the left part of
the whole potentially reconstructable area.  If the Z shift is positive,
the slice is shifted upward.  The Z entry is optional and
defaults to 0 when omitted.

[Field = SIRTIterations]
type = I
usage = Number of iterations to run SIRT procedure
tooltip = 
manpage = This entry directs the program to compute a SIRT reconstruction
internally for the given number of iterations, as described above.  If the
RecFileToReproject option is given, then the program will read in slices from
the existing reconstruction, interpolating between them to make vertical
slices if there is a fixed X-axis tilt.  Each read-in slice or vertical slice
is then used for reprojection and modified by a backprojection of the
difference between the reprojection and the original projection image.  In
this case, the FlatFilterFraction option is not needed, as the appropriate
filter is used automatically.  If no existing reconstruction is given, then
the program generates an initial reconstruction with a flat filter fraction of
1.0 unless a value is supplied with the FlatFilterFraction option.

[Field = SIRTSubtraction]
type = B
usage = Subtract reprojections from original projections before writing
tooltip =
manpage = Subtract reprojections from original projections to produce a
reprojection difference for SIRT.  The width of the reprojection must match
the width of the input data. 

[Field = SLICE]
type = IA
usage = Starting and ending slice number, and interval between slices
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending slice number to reconstruct, and interval
between slices.  The numbers refer to slices in the X/Z plane and correspond
to Y coordinates in the projection images.  Slices are numbered from 0.  
The interval entry is optional, must be positive, and defaults to 1 when 
omitted.

[Field = StartingIteration]
type = I
usage = Starting SIRT iteration number for reports of difference mean and SD
tooltip =
manpage = Starting SIRT iteration number, in order to obtain reports of the
mean and standard deviation of a difference reconstruction in a SIRT
procedure.  These values are computed for slices in the middle 80% of the
slice range, in the middle 80% of the width in X, and in the middle half of
the height in Y.  When running SIRT internally, the statistics are computed as
each difference slice is computed.  Otherwise, they are computed just before
subtracting the difference reconstruction from read-in slices.  A summary is
printed when the program finishes.

[Field = SUBSETSTART]
type = IP
usage = Lower left X, Y coordinates of aligned stack within whole images
tooltip = 
manpage = If the aligned stack contains a subset of the area in the original
images, and this area is not centered in X or a global X-axis tilt or
local alignments are being used, use this entry to enter the X and Y index
coordinates (numbered from 0) of the lower left corner of the subset within the
original images.  A FULLIMAGE entry must also be included.  If the aligned
stack is larger than the original images, use negative values. 

[Field = SubtractFromBase]
type = LI
usage = Views to subtract from previous reconstruction (0 for all, -1 for SIRT)
tooltip = 
manpage = Views to subtract from the previous reconstruction specified by
BaseRecFile.  Without this entry, all views are added.  Enter the list of
specific views to subtract, 0 to have all
included views subtracted, or -1 to have all views subtracted for a SIRT
reconstruction.

[Field = THICKNESS]
type = I
usage = Thickness in Z of reconstructed volume
tooltip = 
manpage = Thickness in Z of reconstructed volume, in pixels

[Field = TILTFILE]
type = FN
usage = File with list of tilt angles
tooltip = 
manpage = Use this entry to specify a file containing a list of all tilt
angles.  The angles may be one per line or many per line.

[Field = TITLE]
type = CH
usage = Title string for output file header
tooltip = 
manpage = An alphanumeric string giving the title for the job, which will be
added to the output map.  Limit 50 characters.  This entry is
optional; the default is "Tomographic reconstruction".

[Field = TOTALSLICES]
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending slices of entire reconstruction
tooltip = 
manpage = This entry is used to allow multiple runs of Tilt to compute a subset
of slices and place them into the same output file.  The values
specify the first and last slice to be reconstructed in the whole
volume, numbered from 0.  When this entry is present, the behavior of
the program depends on the SLICE entry (or the ZMinAndMax entry when
reprojecting from a tomogram).  The program should be run initially with SLICE
-1 -1 (or ZMinAndMax -1 -1 when reprojecting), which will cause it to create
the output file and write its header.  On successive runs with SLICE or
ZMinAndMax indicating a real range of slices, the program will open the
existing file, write only those slices, and not write the header when it is
done.

[Field = UseGPU]
type = I
usage = Use GPU for computation; 0 for best available one or number of GPU
tooltip = 
manpage = Use the GPU (graphical processing unit) for computations if
possible; enter 0 to use the best GPU on the system, or the number of a
specific GPU (numbered from 1).  The GPU can be used for all types of
operations as long as there is sufficient memory.

[Field = ViewsToReproject]
type = LI
usage = List of views to reproject (0 for all, not just included ones)
tooltip = 
manpage = List of views to reproject from a reconstruction file, numbered from
1.  The default
is to project just the views that were included in the reconstruction.  To
project all views in the input projection file, enter 0.

[Field = VertBoundaryFile]
type = FN
usage = File with information for writing vertical slice file in parallel
tooltip =
manpage = File with information about boundaries and temporary files when
writing a vertical slice output file and running multiple chunks in parallel.

[Field = VertSliceOutputFile]
type = FN
usage = File for saving vertical slices when running SIRT internally
tooltip =
manpage = File for saving internally produced vertical slices at the last
iteration when running SIRT internally.  When such a file is saved, SIRT can
be resumed with it and the vertical slices will not be degraded by being
interpolated on output and input.

[Field = VertForSIRTInput]
type = B
usage = The file being reprojected for resuming SIRT is a vertical slice file
tooltip =
manpage = The file to be reprojected when resuming internal SIRT is a vertical
slice file, specified by VertSliceOutputFile on the previous run.  When such a
file is provided, the program will use its slices directly instead of having
to interpolate from the slices of the reconstruction file.

[Field = WeightAngleFile]
type = FN
usage = File with full list of angles to use for weighting
tooltip = 
manpage = File with a list of tilt angles to be used for computing the
relative weighting of the views.  Use this entry to keep the weightings
applied to each view constant across reconstructions from subsets of views,
regardless of which views are actually included in a particular
reconstruction.  For example, when leaving one view out, the two adjacent
views would receive higher weights without this entry, but with this entry 
they would have the same weights as with the view included.

[Field = WeightFile]
type = FN
usage = File with list of weighting factors for all views
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of a file containing a list of weighting factors to be applied
to the views, such as for mass normalization.  The factors may be one per line 
or many per line.  These weights are ignored if the log is being taken of the 
data.

[Field = WIDTH]
type = I
usage = Width of output image
tooltip = 
manpage = The width of the output image; the default is
the width of the input image.

[Field = XAXISTILT]
type = F
usage = Tilt about X-axis to correct in reconstruction
tooltip = 
manpage = This entry allows one to rotate the reconstruction around the X axis,
so that a section that appears to be tilted around the X axis can be
made flat to fit into a smaller volume.  The angle should be the
tilt of the section relative to the X-Y plane in an unrotated
reconstruction.  For example, if the reconstruction extends 500
slices, and the section is 5 pixels below the middle in the first
slice and 5 pixels above the middle in the last slice, the angle should
be 1.1 (the arc sine of 10/500).

[Field = XMinAndMaxReproj]
short = xminmax
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending X index coordinates to reproject
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending X index coordinates of region to reproject from
a reconstruction file (numbered from 0).  The default is the whole extent in X.

[Field = XTILTFILE]
type = FN
usage = File with variable tilts around the X-axis
tooltip = 
manpage = Use this entry to specify a file containing a list of tilts to be
applied around the X axis for the individual views.  A global tilt specified
by the XAXISTILT entry, if any, will be subtracted from these tilts.  If this
file contains all zeros, the program runs the same as if the file was not
entered.

[Field = XTILTINTERP]
type = I
usage = Interpolation order for computing X-tilted slices from vertical ones
tooltip = 
manpage = This entry controls the order for interpolating an output slice
tilted around the X axis from vertical, untilted slices each computed
from a single line of input data.  Set the order to 1 for linear, 2 for
quadratic, 3 for cubic, or 0 to disable this method of X-axis
tilting and revert to computing the output slice directly from input
data.  The default is 1; higher orders are appropriate if data are
particularly noise-free.

[Field = YMinAndMaxReproj]
short = yminmax
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending Y index coordinates to reproject
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending Y index coordinates of region to reproject from
a reconstruction file (numbered from 0).  Y is the thickness dimension. 
The default is the whole extent in Y.

[Field = ZFACTORFILE]
type = FN
usage = File with Z-factors
tooltip = 
manpage = Use this entry to specify a file containing factors for adjusting the
backprojection position in each image as a function of Z height in the
output slice.  These factors are necessary when input images have been
transformed to correct for an apparent specimen stretch.  If this entry is
absent, Z factors in a local alignment file will not be applied.

[Field = ZMinAndMaxReproj]
short = zminmax
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending Z index coordinates to reproject
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending Z index coordinates of region to reproject from
a reconstruction file (numbered from 0).  Z is the the dimension along the
tilt axis.  The default is the whole extent in Z.

[Field = DebugOutput]
short = debug
type = B
usage = Print output for debugging

[Field = InternalSIRTSlices]
short = internal
type = IP
usage = Output reprojections (1-2) and/or internal reconstructions (1-4)
tooltip = 
manpage = Output reprojections or reconstruction slices held internally on the
last iteration of SIRT.  The first value is the type of reprojection: 0 for
none, 1 for actual reprojection, or 2 for difference between reprojection and
input data.  The second value is for type of slice: 0 for none, 1 for
backprojection of difference lines, 2 for final vertical slice, 3 for slice
produced on iteration 0, and 4 for vertical slice decomposed from input.
Output files are sirttst.prj and sirttst.drec, respectively.

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.

[Field = usage]
short = help
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage =
