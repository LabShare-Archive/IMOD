[Field = InputProjections]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input image file with aligned projections
tooltip = 
manpage = Input image file with aligned projections.  If this option is not
entered, the first non-option argument is taken as the input name.

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output file for reconstruction or reprojection
tooltip = 
manpage = Output file for reconstruction or reprojection.  If this option is
not entered, the second non-option argument is taken as the output name. 

[Field = RecFileToReproject]
short = recfile
type = FN
usage = Reconstruction file to reproject
tooltip = 
manpage = Reconstruction file to reproject.  When using this option, all of the
entries to the program used when building this reconstruction should be
included as well.

[Field = ANGLES]
type = FAM
usage = Tilt angles of the views
tooltip = 
manpage = Use this entry to specify the tilt angles of the views if they are
not in a separate file.  You must enter one tilt
angle for each view.  Use more than one ANGLES entry if necessary.
This information will override tilt angles specified in the file
header.  If you enter angles in this way, the file header need not
contain tilt information.

[Field = COMPFRACTION]
type = F
usage = Fraction of distance over which compression occurred
tooltip = 
manpage = If the compression measured by TILTALIGN occurred over
only a fraction of the distance between the fiducials, enter the fraction with
this option.

[Field = COMPRESS]
type = FAM
usage = Compression factors of the views
tooltip = 
manpage = With this entry, the program will assume that the section has
compressed in Z by the amount given by the amount given for each
view.  The compressions would be taken directly from the  output of
TILTALIGN for incremental compression.  A value must be entered for
each view.

[Field = COSINTERP]
type = IA
usage = Interpolation order and sampling factor for cosine stretching
tooltip = 
manpage = Interpolation order and sampling factor for cosine stretching
for cosine stretching of the input data.  The order can be 1 for linear,
2 for quadratic, 3 for cubic, or 0 to disable cosine stretching.
The default is linear to provide some smoothing of the data; higher
orders are appropriate if data are relatively noise-free.  The factor is
optional; the default is 2, which prevents further smoothing when
the stretched data are linearly interpolated during backprojection.  

[Field = DENSWEIGHT]
type = FA
usage = Weighting to compute local average tilt increment
tooltip = 
manpage = Use this entry to control the weighting of each view proportional
to the local average tilt increment between views.  The first value specifies
the number of intervals on EACH side of a view to consider; the default
is 2, and a value of 0 disables weighting.  Optionally, this value may be
followed by that number of weights to be applied in averaging the adjacent
increments (the default is equal weighting).

[Field = DONE]
type = B
usage = Terminate input to program
tooltip = 
manpage = The entry is equivalent to EndInput, and lines of input following
it will be ignored.  This option is provided for compatibility with old
command files.


[Field = EXCLUDELIST2]
type = LIM
usage = List of views to exclude (comma-separated ranges allowed)
tooltip = 
manpage = List of views to be excluded from the reconstruction.  The list
can consist of individual view numbers, or of ranges (e.g., 1-4), separated
by commas or spaces.  The EXCLUDE and EXCLUDELIST entries available in
old versions of the program are treated as this option.
You may have any number of entries with exclude lists, but they cannot be 
combined with INCLUDE entries.

[Field = FlatFilterFraction]
type = F
usage = Fraction of constant filter to mix with R-weighting, or > 1 for SIRT
tooltip = 
manpage = With a value entered between 0 and 1, the radial filter will be set
up as a linear combination of the standard R-weighting filter and a flat
filter, which will greatly overemphasize low frequencies.  The entered value
is the fraction for the flat filter.  The flat filter is scaled to give
output densities roughly comparable to those obtained with the R-weighting
filter.  The zero-frequency component of each filter is 0.2 times the
component at the lowest non-zero frequency.  If the value is greater than one,
a filter suitable for Simultaneous Iterative Reconstruction (SIRT) is set up,
scaled so as to distribute input values equally along each ray.  The
zero-frequency component is the same as the other components in this case.

[Field = FBPINTERP]
type = I
usage = Interpolation order for fast backprojection (default 1)
tooltip = 
manpage = The interpolation order for the fast
backprojection algorithm: 1 for linear interpolation (the default),
3 for cubic spline interpolation, which will low-pass filter the
input data more, or 0 to disable fast backprojection.  Entering a 
value with this option will also force the program to use fast
backprojection even if the width, thickness, and number of views
are small enough so that fast backprojection will run slower than
direct summation.

[Field = FULLIMAGE]
type = IP
usage = Full size of original, unaligned images
tooltip = 
manpage = Use this entry to specify the full size in X and Y of the
original stack of tilted views, so that a subset of the aligned
stack can be handled properly when using a global X-axis tilt or
local alignments.

[Field = IMAGEBINNED]
type = I
usage = Binning of input images
tooltip = 
manpage = If the input images have been binned, this entry can be entered to
specify the binning and have various other dimensions scaled down by
this factor.  Values entered with SHIFT, OFFSET, THICKNESS, WIDTH,
FULLIMAGESIZE, SLICE, and SUBSETSTART will be scaled.  These entries
thus do not need to be changed when the input binning is changed.

[Field = INCLUDE]
type = LIM
usage = List of views to include in the reconstruction
tooltip = 
manpage = A subset of views to be used for the
reconstruction.  The values can be individual view numbers or ranges,
separated by spaces or commas.  Use more than one INCLUDE entry if the numbers
do not all fit on one line.

[Field = LOCALFILE]
type = FN
usage = File with local tilt alignment information
tooltip = 
manpage = File containing local tilt alignment information.

[Field = LOCALSCALE]
type = F
usage = Factor by which images were scaled relative to local alignment data
tooltip = 
manpage = If local tilt alignments were obtained from unreduced data, but the
aligned stack was reduced by binning or transforming, use this entry
to specify the factor by which the data were scaled, so that the
local alignment information can be adjusted.  Without this entry, the program
will use the ratio of the pixel size at which local alignments were computed
to the pixel size of the aligned images, which should be correct
if data were binned.

[Field = LOG]
type = F
usage = Take the logarithm after adding the given base value
tooltip = 
manpage = This entry allows one to generate a reconstruction using the
logarithm of the densities in the input file, with the value BASE 
added before taking the logarithm.

[Field = MASK]
type = F
usage = Value for masking regions with incomplete data
tooltip = 
manpage = This entry allows a mask to be applied so as to exclude from the
reconstructed volume those parts which lie outside the volume for
which the projection data are complete.  This volume is a cylinder whose axis
lies along the tilt axis.  Grid points outside this volume will be set to the
given value.  For thick sections, this
option saves a little execution time but produces sharp edges in the
reconstruction. 

[Field = MODE]
type = I
usage = Output file mode (default 2)
tooltip = 
manpage = This entry allows one to specify the data mode of the output file,
which is 2 by default.  Be sure to use an appropriate SCALE entry so
that data will be scaled to the proper range.

[Field = OFFSET]
type = FA
usage = Offsets for tilt angles and tilt axis
tooltip = 
manpage = This entry allows an offset of DELANG degrees to be applied to all
tilt angles and indicates that the tilt axis is offset in the
projection images, cutting the X-axis at  NX/2. + DELXX instead of
NX/2.  DELANG positive rotates reconstructed sections anticlockwise.
The DELXX entry is optional and defaults to 0 when omitted.  If the
tilt axis is offset from the center because the projection images are a
non-centered subset of the full images, use the SUBSETSTART entry
instead.

[Field = PARALLEL]
type = B
usage = Output slices parallel to the plane of the specimen
tooltip = 
manpage = Output slices parallel to the plane of the zero tilt projection.
This option cannot be used with direct writing of data to a single output file
from parallel Tilt runs.  It inverts the handedness of the reconstruction.

[Field = PERPENDICULAR]
type = B
usage = Output slices perpendicular to the plane of the specimen (default)
tooltip = 
manpage = Output slices perpendicular to the plane of the specimen.  This
output is the default since it corresponds to the way in which slices are
computed.

[Field = RADIAL]
type = FP
usage = Cutoff and sigma of Gaussian falloff for radial weighting function.
tooltip = 
manpage = This entry controls low-pass filtering with the radial weighting
function.  The radial weighting function is linear away from the origin out to
the distance in reciprocal space specified by the first value, followed by a 
Gaussian fall-off with a s.d. (sigma) given by the second value.  If the
cutoff is great than 1 the distances are interpreted as pixels in Fourier
space; otherwise they are treated as frequencies in cycles/pixel, which range
from 0 to 0.5.

[Field = REPLICATE]
type = FPM
usage = Number of times to replicate views, and angle or replication
tooltip = 
manpage = With this entry, the input views will be replicated the number of
times given by the first value, with an increment given by the second value in
degrees added to the original angles for each replication.  For example, if
you can assume 9-fold symmetry, enter REPLICATE 8 40.

[Field = REPROJECT]
type = FAM
usage = Angles for reprojections of reconstructed slices
tooltip = 
manpage = With this entry, the program will output one or more reprojections 
of the reconstructed slices at the given angles.  If RecFileToReproject is 
entered, then the reprojections should match the input projections; otherwise
the reprojections will be of the computed slices and should match what
Xyzproj(1) would produce.

[Field = SCALE]
type = FP
usage = Values to add then scale reconstructed densities by
tooltip = 
manpage = With this entry, the values in the reconstruction will be scaled by
adding the first value then multiplying by the second one.  The default is
0,1.  After the reconstruction is complete, the program will output the
scale values that would make the data range from 10 to 245.

[Field = SHIFT]
type = FA
usage = Amount to shift reconstructed slice in X and Y
tooltip = 
manpage = This entry allows one to shift the reconstructed slice in X or Z
before it is output.  If the X shift is positive, the slice will be
shifted to the right, and the output will contain the left part of
the whole potentially reconstructable area.  If the Z shift is positive,
the slice is shifted upward.  The Z entry is optional and
defaults to 0 when omitted.

[Field = SLICE]
type = FA
usage = Starting and ending slice number, and interval between slices
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending slice number to reconstruct, and interval
between slices.  The numbers refer to slices in the X/Z plane and correspond
to Y coordinates in the projection images.  Slices are numbered from 0.  
The interval entry is optional and defaults to 1 when omitted.

[Field = SUBSETSTART]
type = IP
usage = Lower left X, Y coordinates of aligned stack within whole images
tooltip = 
manpage = If the aligned stack contains a subset of the area in the original
images, and this area is not centered in X or a global X-axis tilt or
local alignments are being used, use this entry to enter the X and Y index
coordinates (numbered from 0) of the lower left corner of the subset within the
original images.  A FULLIMAGE entry must also be included.  If the aligned
stack is larger than the original images, use negative values. 

[Field = THICKNESS]
type = I
usage = Thickness in Z of reconstructed volume
tooltip = 
manpage = Thickness in Z of reconstructed volume, in pixels

[Field = TILTFILE]
type = FN
usage = File with list of tilt angles
tooltip = 
manpage = Use this entry to specify a file containing a list of all tilt
angles.  The angles may be one per line or many per line.

[Field = TITLE]
type = CH
usage = Title string for output file header
tooltip = 
manpage = An alphanumeric string giving the title for the job, which will be
added to the output map.  Limit 50 characters.  This entry is
optional; the default is "Tomographic reconstruction".

[Field = TOTALSLICES]
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending slices of entire reconstruction
tooltip = 
manpage = This entry is used to allow multiple runs of Tilt to compute a subset
of slices and place them into the same output file.  The values
specify the first and last slice to be reconstructed in the whole
volume, numbered from 0.  When this entry is present, the behavior of
the program depends on the SLICE entry (or the ZMinAndMax entry when
reprojecting from a tomogram).  The program should be run initially with SLICE
-1 -1 (or ZMinAndMax -1 -1 when reprojecting), which will cause it to create
the output file and write its header.  On successive runs with SLICE or
ZMinAndMax indicating a real range of slices, the program will open the
existing file, write only those slices, and not write the header when it is
done.

[Field = ViewsToReproject]
type = LI
usage = List of views to reproject (0 for all, not just included ones)
tooltip = 
manpage = List of views to reproject from a reconstruction file.  The default
is to project just the views that were included in the reconstruction.  To
project all views in the input projection file, enter 0.

[Field = WeightFile]
type = FN
usage = File with list of weighting factors for all views
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of a file containing a list of weighting factors to be applied
to the views, such as for mass normalization.  The factors may be one per line 
or many per line.  These weights are ignored if the log is being taken of the 
data.

[Field = WIDTH]
type = I
usage = Width of output image
tooltip = 
manpage = The width of the output image; the default is
the width of the input image.

[Field = XAXISTILT]
type = F
usage = Tilt about X-axis to correct in reconstruction
tooltip = 
manpage = This entry allows one to rotate the reconstruction around the X axis,
so that a section that appears to be tilted around the X axis can be
made flat to fit into a smaller volume.  The angle should be the
tilt of the section relative to the X-Y plane in an unrotated
reconstruction.  For example, if the reconstruction extends 500
slices, and the section is 5 pixels below the middle in the first
slice and 5 pixels above the middle in the last slice, the angle should
be 1.1 (the arc sine of 10/500).

[Field = XMinAndMaxReproj]
short = xminmax
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending X index coordinates to reproject
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending X index coordinates of region to reproject from
a reconstruction file (numbered from 0).  The default is the whole extent in X.

[Field = XTILTFILE]
type = FN
usage = File with variable tilts around the X-axis
tooltip = 
manpage = Use this entry to specify a file containing a list of tilts around
the X axis for the individual views.  A global tilt specified by the
XAXISTILT entry, if any, will be added to these tilts.  If this file contains
all zeros, the program runs the same as if the file was not entered.

[Field = XTILTINTERP]
type = I
usage = Interpolation order for computing X-tilted slices from vertical ones
tooltip = 
manpage = This entry controls the order for interpolating an output slice
tilted around the X axis from vertical, untilted slices each computed
from a single line of input data.  Set the order to 1 for linear, 2 for
quadratic, 3 for cubic, or 0 to disable this method of X-axis
tilting and revert to computing the output slice directly from input
data.  The default is 1; higher orders are appropriate if data are
particularly noise-free.

[Field = YMinAndMaxReproj]
short = yminmax
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending Y index coordinates to reproject
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending Y index coordinates of region to reproject from
a reconstruction file (numbered from 0).  Y is the thickness dimension. 
The default is the whole extent in Y.

[Field = ZFACTORFILE]
type = FN
usage = File with Z-factors
tooltip = 
manpage = Use this entry to specify a file containing factors for adjusting the
backprojection position in each image as a function of Z height in the
output slice.  These factors are necessary when input images have been
transformed to correct for an apparent specimen stretch.  If this entry is
absent, Z factors in a local alignment file will not be applied.

[Field = ZMinAndMaxReproj]
short = zminmax
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending Z index coordinates to reproject
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending Z index coordinates of region to reproject from
a reconstruction file (numbered from 0).  Z is the the dimension along the
tilt axis.  The default is the whole extent in Z.

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.

[Field = usage]
short = help
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage =
