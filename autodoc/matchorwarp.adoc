[Field = InputVolume]
type = FN
usage = Input file to be transformed
tooltip = 
manpage = Input file to be transformed.  If this option is not entered, the
first nonoption argument is taken as the input volume.

[Field = OutputVolume]
type = FN
usage = Transformed output file
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of transformed file to be produced.  If this option is not entered, the
second nonoption argument is taken as this name.

[Field = size]
type = CH
usage = Either name or X,Y,Z size of file being matched to
tooltip = 
manpage = Specifies the size of the volume being matched to;
the entry can be either the name of that file or its NX,NY,NZ dimensions.

[Field = refinelimit]
type = F
usage = Mean residual limit for using refinematch and matchvol (default 0.3)
tooltip =
manpage = The maximum mean residual that will be allowed when running 
Refinematch(1) and Matchvol(1).

[Field = warplimit]
type = CH
usage = Mean residual limits which findwarp will try to achieve, or 0 not to
warp (default 0.2,0.27,0.35)
tooltip =
manpage = A list of mean residuals that Warpvol(1) will attempt to achieve
automatically.  Values should be in increasing order and separated by commas.

[Field = modelfile]
type = FN
usage = Model file defining patches to include
tooltip =
manpage = Name of a model file with contours enclosing the patches to include
in fits.

[Field = patchfile]
type = FN
usage = File of patch displacements (default patch.out)
tooltip =
manpage = Name of the existing file with list of patch displacements (default
patch.out). 

[Field = solvefile]
type = FN
usage = Initial transform file (default solve.xf)
tooltip =
manpage = Name of the existing file with the initial transformation between
volumes (default solve.xf).

[Field = refinefile]
type = FN
usage = Refining transform output file (default refine.xf)
tooltip =
manpage = Name of the file into which Refinematch(1) will place the refining
transformation (default refine.xf).

[Field = inversefile]
type = FN
usage = Inverse transform output file (default inverse.xf)
tooltip =
manpage = Name of the file into which Matchvol(1) will place the inverse cumulative
transformation (default inverse.xf).

[Field = warpfile]
type = FN
usage = Warp transform output file (default warp.xf)
tooltip =
manpage = Name of the file into which Warpvol(1) will place the inverse warping 
transformations (default warp.xf).


[Field = residualfile]
type = FN
usage = Output file for patch displacements with residuals
tooltip =
manpage = Name of the file into which Refinematch(1) and/or Warpvol(1) will place a new
list of the patches, their displacements, and the residual from the fits.

[Field = vectormodel]
type = FN
usage = Output file for model of patches with residuals
tooltip =
manpage = Name of patch vector model file to create from the residual file with 
Patch2imod(1).

[Field = clipsize]
type = I
usage = Size of clipping plane box in patch model
tooltip =
manpage = If writing a patch vector model, set up four clipping planes enclosing a
square central area of the given size.

[Field = tempdir]
type = FN
usage = Directory for temporary files
tooltip =
manpage = Path name of directory into which Matchvol or Warpvol can place temporary
files.

[Field = xlowerexclude]
type = I
usage = Columns to exclude on the left side
tooltip = 
manpage = The number of columns of patches to exclude on the left side of
the volume.

[Field = xupperexclude]
type = I
usage = Columns to exclude on the right side
tooltip =
manpage = The number of columns of patches to exclude on the right side of
the volume.

[Field = ylowerexclude]
type = I
usage = Rows or slabs to exclude at low Y
tooltip =
manpage = The number of rows or slabs of patches to exclude on the lower Y side
of the volume.

[Field = yupperexclude]
type = I
usage = Rows or slabs to exclude at high Y
tooltip =
manpage = The number of rows or slabs of patches to exclude on the upper Y side
of the volume.

[Field = zlowerexclude]
type = I
usage = Slabs or rows to exclude at low Z
tooltip = 
manpage = The number of slabs or rows of patches to exclude on the lower Z
side of the volume.  This would be used to specify rows on the bottom when 
viewing a volume in flipped orientation.

[Field = zupperexclude]
type = I
usage = Slabs or rows to exclude at high Z
tooltip =
manpage = The number of slabs or rows of patches to exclude on the upper Z
side of the volume.  This would be used to specify rows on the top when 
viewing a volume in flipped orientation.

[Field = linear]
type = B
usage = Use linear interpolation in Matchvol/Warpvol
tooltip =
manpage = Use linear instead of quadratic interpolation for transforming the volume
with Matchvol(1) or Warpvol(1).

[Field = trial]
type = B
usage = Run Refinewarp/Findwarp but not Matchvol/Warpvol
tooltip =
manpage = Use a trial mode, in which the program exits after finding a good fit
rather than going on to Matchvol or Warpvol.
