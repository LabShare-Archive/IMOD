[Field = ZFindStartAndEnd]
short = sz
type = IP
usage = Scale to bytes, finding contrast from given range of slices in Z
tooltip =
manpage = Scale to bytes, determining the optimal scaling to bytes by analyzing
intensities from sections between the two given numbers, inclusive.
Coordinates are treated as
coming from a flipped volume only if the "-f"
option is given.  Slices are numbered from 1 regardless of whether the "-i"
option is used.

[Field = XFindStartAndEnd]
short = sx
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending X coordinates to use to find contrast for scaling
to bytes
tooltip =
manpage = Analyze the region between this starting and ending coordinate in X
to determine the scaling to bytes.  The default is to use 80% of the range in X.

[Field = YFindStartAndEnd]
short = sy
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending Y coordinates to use to find contrast for scaling
to bytes
tooltip =
manpage = Analyze the region between this starting and ending coordinate in Y
to determine the scaling to bytes.  The default is to use 80% of the range in Y.

[Field = ContrastBlackWhite]
short = c
type = IP
usage = Contrast levels for scaling and converting to bytes
tooltip =
manpage = Scale to bytes, with relative intensities between the two entered
numbers (representing black and white values on a
scale of 0 to 255) stretched to occupy the full range of byte values.

[Field = IntegerMinMax]
short = mm
type = IP
usage = New minimum and maximum for scaling to integers
to bytes
tooltip =
manpage = Scale to integers (mode 1), so that the current minimum and maximum of the file
would be scaled to the given values of minimum and maximum.  Newstack(1) is
run with the -scale option and the entered values.  This option would be used
to scale from mode 2 (floating point) to mode 1.

[Field = RotateX]
short = rx
type = B
usage = Rotate volume by -90 degrees around X axis
tooltip =
manpage = Rotate the output volume by -90 degrees around the X axis, by first creating a
temporary trimmed volume
with newstack then running "clip rotx" on this volume to create the final
output file.  The slices will look the same as with the "-yz"
option but rotating instead
of flipping will preserve the handedness of structures.

[Field = FlipYZ]
short = yz
type = B
usage = Exchange (flip) Y and Z in output volume
tooltip =
manpage = Flip Y and Z in the output volume by first creating a temporary trimmed volume
with newstack then running "clip flipyz" on this volume to create the final
output file.  Do not use this option unless you intend to invert handedness.

[Field = IndexCoordinates]
short = i
type = B
usage = Treat as index coordinates (numbered from 0) rather than
as 3dmod coordinates (numbered from 1, the default)
tooltip =
manpage = Interpret "-x", "-y", "-z", "-sx", and "-sy" entries as index
coordinates numbered from 0, rather than as 3dmod coordinates numbered from 1.

[Field = FlippedCoordinates]
short = f
type = B
usage = Treat coordinates as coming from a volume viewed with flipping in 3dmod 
tooltip =
manpage = Interpret "-y", "-z", "-ny", "-nz", "-sy", and "-sz"
entries as referring to a volume viewed in flipped orientation in 3dmod, with
Y and Z sizes swapped.  This
option allows you to enter the coordinates as they appear in 3dmod when the
volume is loaded with flipping (the -Y option).  The program assumes that
flipping occurred by rotating around the X axis, unless the "-old" option is given.

[Field = OldFlippedCoordinates]
short = old
type = I
usage = Some or all Z coordinates are based on flipping with Y and Z axes swapped
tooltip =
manpage = This option indicates that Z coordinates were obtained by loading
the volume with the -Y option into a 
version of 3dmod prior to 4.6.18, where flipping was done by exchanging the Y
and Y axes instead of rotating around X.  Enter the sum of 1 if the "-z" entry
is based on such flipping and 2 if the "-sz" entry is based on such flipping.
 
[Field = KeepOrigin]
short = k
type = B
usage = Keep origin the same in output from Newstack (legacy)
tooltip =
manpage = Keep the origin the same in the output from Newstack(1) instead of
passing it the -origin option to adjust the origin for the location of the
subvolume being created.  This option can be used to reproduce a volume
created with earlier versions of IMOD.

[Field = PID]
type = B
usage = Print process ID
tooltip =
