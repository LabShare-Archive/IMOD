[Field = InputFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input model file
tooltip = 
manpage = Input model file. 

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output model file
tooltip = 
manpage = Output model file. 

[Field = ObjectsToReduce]
short = objects
type = LI
usage = List of objects to reduce (default is to do all objects)
tooltip = 
manpage = A list of the objects to reduce (ranges are allowed, e.g. 1,2,5-7).
The default is to do all closed contour objects, and open contours that lie in
one plane.

[Field = Tolerance]
short = tolerance
type = F
usage =  Tolerance value, or maximum change in the model (default 0.25 pixels)
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = SmoothingPointsAndOrder]
short = smoothing
type = IP
usage = Number of points, and polynomial order, for the smoothing step
tooltip = 
manpage = Number of points, and polynomial order, for the smoothing step.
Enter 0,0 to omit smoothing.  Defaults are 5 points and order 2.

[Field = SpacedPointsTarget]
short = spaced
type = F
usage =  Replace each contours with points equally spaced along contour
tooltip = 
manpage = This option invokes an alternative method in which each contour is
replaced by a set of points equally spaced along the contour, where the
spacing is as close as possible to the given target spacing.  However, the
spacing will be made larger, if necessary, to keep the total number of points
from increasing.  The new points are interpolated along the line segments
between the previous contour points and the distances between them will vary
depending on the curvature of the contour.  The distance along the contour is
in 3D and thus this option works for open contours that do not lie in a plane.
This option cannot be entered together with -tolerance or -smoothing.

[Field = usage]
short = help
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage = Print help output.
