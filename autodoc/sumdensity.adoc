[Field = Image file]
short=image
long=ImageFile
type=FN
usage=Input image file
tooltip=
manpage= Input image file with densities to be summed.  If this option
is not entered, the first non-option argument will be used for this input
file.

[Field = Model file]
short=model
long=ModelFile
type=FN
usage=Input model file with contours defining areas to sum
tooltip=
manpage= Input model file with contours delimiting areas to be summed.  
If this option is not entered, the second non-option argument will be used for
this input file.

[Field = Output file]
short=output
long=OutputFile
type=FN
usage=Output file for results
tooltip=
manpage= Output file for results. If this option is not entered, the 
third non-option argument will be used for this output file.  If no output
file is entered, results will be printed to standard output.

[Field = Pixel model]
short=pixel
long=PixelModel
type=FN
usage=Output file for model with scattered points on pixels in sum
tooltip=
manpage= Output file for model with added scattered-point objects containing
points on all of the pixels that were included in the sum

[Field = Objects to do]
short=objects
long=ObjectsToDo
type=LI
usage=Objects to compute sums within (Default is all closed contour objects)
tooltip=
manpage= A list of objects containing boundary contours within which
to compute sums.  The default is to do all closed contour objects.

[Field = Border size]
short=border
long=BorderSize
type=F
usage=Distance from contour within which to exclude pixels from consideration
tooltip=
manpage=Distance from contour within which to exclude pixels from
consideration.  For example, if the contours are drawn on the centers of
membranes, this entry can be used to exclude pixels in the membrane as well as
within a certain distance of the membrane.  The default is to include all
pixels within the contour. 

[Field = Inside border]
short=inside
long=InsideBorder
type=F
usage=Distance from interior contour within which to exclude pixels
tooltip=
manpage=Distance from interior contours within which to exclude pixels from
consideration.  All pixels inside of interior contours will be excluded, so
this entry governs the border outside those contours.  The default is to
use the BorderSize value.

[StartGroup = Threshold setting]
[Field = Absolute threshold]
short=absolute
long=AbsoluteThreshold
type=F
usage=Threshold value in absolute units of the image file density
tooltip=
manpage=

[Field = Contrast threshold]
short=contrast
long=ContrastThreshold
type=I
usage=Relative threshold in units of black/white contrast settings, range 0-255
tooltip=
manpage=Relative threshold in units of black/white contrast settings after
loading the data into 3dmod with the default scaling.  This value should
be in the range 0-255.
[EndGroup]

[Field = Reference object]
short=reference
long=ReferenceObject
type=I
usage=Object enclosing areas from which to measure threshold
tooltip=
manpage=Object enclosing areas from which to measure threshold.  Multiple
contours can be used to sample several areas for setting the threshold.

[Field = Reverse polarity]
short=reverse
long=ReversePolarity
type=B
usage=Count and sum pixels lower than the threshold instead of higher
tooltip=
manpage= Count and sum pixels lower than the threshold instead of higher.  The
densities to be summed can have either positive or negative contrast; use this
option in the latter case.

[Field = Verbose output]
short=verbose
long=VerboseOutput
type=B
usage=Output counts and densities for every contour
tooltip=
manpage=

[Field = Parameter File]
short=param
long=ParameterFile
type=PF
usage=Read parameter entries from file
tooltip=
manpage=

[Field = usage]
short=help
long=usage
type=B
usage=Print help output
