[Field = ImageFile]  
short = image
type = FN
usage = Input image file
tooltip = 
manpage =  Input image file with densities to be summed.  If this option
is not entered, the first non-option argument will be used for this input
file.

[Field = ModelFile]
short = model
type = FN
usage = Input model file with contours defining areas to sum
tooltip = 
manpage =  Input model file with contours delimiting areas to be summed.
If this option is not entered, the second non-option argument will be used for
this input file.

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output file for results
tooltip = 
manpage = Output file for results. If this option is not entered, the 
third non-option argument will be used for this output file.  If no output
file is entered, results will be printed to standard output.

[Field = PixelModel]
short = pixel
type = FN
usage = Output file for model with scattered points on pixels in sum
tooltip = 
manpage = Output file for model with added scattered-point objects containing
points on the pixels that were included in the sum.

[Field = AdjacentRequired]
short = adjacent
type = I
usage = Number of adjacent points above threshold required to include in model
tooltip = 
manpage = Number of adjacent points above threshold required to include a given
point in the output model.  All points above threshold will be counted in the
density sums, but only those that meet this requirement will be marked in the
model.

[Field = DiagonalsCount]
short = diagonals
type = B
usage = Diagonal pixels (corners touching) count as adjacent
tooltip = 
manpage = Count all 8 neighboring pixels,incuding ones on diagonals, when
determining whether a point is adjacent to the required number above threshold.

[Field = ObjectsToDo]
short = objects
type = LI
usage = Objects to compute sums within (Default is all closed contour objects)
tooltip = 
manpage = A list of objects containing boundary contours within which
to compute sums.  The default is to do all closed contour objects.

[Field = BorderSize]
short = border
type = F
usage = Distance from contour within which to exclude pixels from consideration
tooltip = 
manpage = Distance from contour within which to exclude pixels from
consideration.  For example, if the contours are drawn on the centers of
membranes, this entry can be used to exclude pixels in the membrane as well as
within a certain distance of the membrane.  The default is to include all
pixels within the contour. 

[Field = InsideBorder]
short = inside
type = F
usage = Distance from interior contour within which to exclude pixels
tooltip = 
manpage = Distance from interior contours within which to exclude pixels from
consideration.  All pixels inside of interior contours will be excluded, so
this entry governs the border outside those contours.  The default is to
use the BorderSize value.

[StartGroup = Threshold setting]
[Field = AbsoluteThreshold]
short = absolute
type = F
usage = Threshold value in absolute units of the image file density
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = ContrastThreshold]
short = contrast
type = I
usage = Relative threshold in units of black/white contrast settings, range 0-255
tooltip = 
manpage = Relative threshold in units of black/white contrast settings after
loading the data into 3dmod with the default scaling.  This value should
be in the range 0-255.
[EndGroup]

[Field = ReferenceObject]
short = reference
type = I
usage = Object enclosing areas from which to measure threshold
tooltip = 
manpage = Object enclosing areas from which to measure threshold.  Multiple
contours can be used to sample several areas for setting the threshold.

[Field = ReversePolarity]
short = reverse
type = B
usage = Count and sum pixels lower than the threshold instead of higher
tooltip = 
manpage = Count and sum pixels lower than the threshold instead of higher.  The
densities to be summed can have either positive or negative contrast; use this
option in the latter case.

[Field = VerboseOutput]
short = verbose
type = B
usage = Output counts and densities for every contour
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = usage]
short = help
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage =
