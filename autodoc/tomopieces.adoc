[Field = XMaximumPieces]
short = xmaxpiece
long = XMaximumPieces
type = I
usage = Maximum number of pieces in X (default is 0)
tooltip = 
manpage = Maximum number of pieces in X.  Enter -1 for essentially no
constraints (a maximum of X image size divided by 2).  The default is 0
for X and Y, which will make the total number of pieces in X and Y be no
more than 19.  If the maximum for Y is set to 1, a value of 0 for X will make
the number of pieces in X be no more than 19.  These constraints will allow 
Assemblevol to keep all files in one layer in Z open at once.

[Field = YMaximumPieces]
short = ymaxpiece
long = YMaximumPieces
type = I
usage = Maximum number of pieces in Y (default is 0; entries of 0 for X and Y
give a maximum total in X and Y of 19)
tooltip = 
manpage = Maximum number of pieces in Y.  Enter -1 for essentially no
constraints (a maximum of Y image size divided by 2).  The default is 0; see
entry for XMaximumPieces.  If the maximum for X is set to 1, a value of 0 for 
Y will make the number of pieces in Y be no more than 19.

[Field = ZMaximumPieces]
short = zmaxpiece
long = ZMaximumPieces
type = I
usage = Maximum number of pieces in Z; the default is -1 for NZ/2
tooltip = 
manpage = Maximum number of pieces in Z.  The default is -1 for essentially
no constraints (a maximum of Z image size divided by 2).

type = I
usage = Minimum number of pixels to overlap between pieces (default 4)
