[Field = TomogramOrSizeXYZ]

usage = Input file to be cut up, or the dimensions in X, Y and Z

[Field = MegaVoxels]
short = megavox
long = MegaVoxels
type = F
usage = Maximum number of megavoxels to allow in each piece (default 20)

type = I
usage = Number of pixels to pad on each side in X (default 8)

[Field = XMaximumPieces]
short = xmaxpiece
long = XMaximumPieces
type = I
usage = Maximum number of pieces in X (default is 0)
tooltip = 
manpage = Maximum number of pieces in X.  Enter -1 for essentially no
constraints (a maximum of X image size divided by 2).  The default is 0
for X and Y, which will make the total number of pieces in X and Y be no
more than 19.  If the maximum for Y is set to 1, a value of 0 for X will make
the number of pieces in X be no more than 19.  These constraints will allow 
Assemblevol to keep all files in one layer in Z open at once.

[Field = YMaximumPieces]
short = ymaxpiece
long = YMaximumPieces
type = I
usage = Maximum number of pieces in Y (default is 0; entries of 0 for X and Y
give a maximum total in X and Y of 19)
tooltip = 
manpage = Maximum number of pieces in Y.  Enter -1 for essentially no
constraints (a maximum of Y image size divided by 2).  The default is 0; see
entry for XMaximumPieces.  If the maximum for X is set to 1, a value of 0 for 
Y will make the number of pieces in Y be no more than 19.

[Field = ZMaximumPieces]
short = zmaxpiece
long = ZMaximumPieces
type = I
usage = Maximum number of pieces in Z; the default is -1 for NZ/2
tooltip = 
manpage = Maximum number of pieces in Z.  The default is -1 for essentially
no constraints (a maximum of Z image size divided by 2).

[Field = MinimumOverlap]
short = minoverlap
long = MinimumOverlap
type = I
usage = Minimum number of pixels to overlap between pieces (default 4)
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = NoFFTSizes]
short = nofft
type = B
usage = Do not adjust the padding to give sizes suitable for an FFT
tooltip = 
manpage = Do not adjust the padding to give sizes suitable for an FFT.  If
this option is entered, be sure that it is also sent to Taperoutvol(1).

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
long = ParameterFile
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.
