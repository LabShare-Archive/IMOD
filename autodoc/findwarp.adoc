[Field = PatchFile]
short = patch
type = FN
usage = Name of input file with positions and displacements
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of input file with positions and displacements.  If this option
is not entered, the first non-option argument will be used for the input file
name.

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output file for warping transformations (optional)
tooltip = 
manpage = Optional output file for warping transformations.  If this option is
not entered, the second non-option argument (if any) will be used for the
output file name.

[Field = RegionModel]
short = region
type = FN
usage = Model file with contours enclosing patches to be included in fits
tooltip = 
manpage = Model file with contours enclosing the patches to be included in the
fits.

[Field = VolumeOrSizeXYZ]
short = volume
type = FN
usage = Filename or X, Y, Z size of volume being matched to
tooltip = 
manpage = Either the name of the file or the X, Y, and Z dimensions of the
volume being matched to.

[Field = InitialTransformFile]
short = initial
type = FN
usage = File with initial 3D transform for second volume
tooltip = 
manpage = File with initial 3D transform used to make the second volume for
the patch correlations.  This transform will be incorporated into the warping
transformations written to the output file

[Field = ResidualPatchOutput]
short = residual
type = FN
usage = Output file for patch vectors including mean residual values
tooltip = 
manpage = Output file for positions, displacements, and mean residual values,
averaged over all the fits that include a position.  This value will be zero
for patches excluded from all fits.  If the patch input file
has correlation coefficients, they will be replaced by the residuals.  

[Field = TargetMeanResidual]
short = target
type = FA
usage = Target mean residuals to achieve in automatic fitting
tooltip = 
manpage = One or more mean residual values to try to reach in the automatic
search for the best warping.  Multiple values should be entered in increasing
order.  The program will try to find a warping with the largest number of
included patches that gives a mean residual below the first value; then it
tries again with the second value, etc.

[Field = MeasuredRatioMinAndMax]
short = measured
type = FP
usage = Min and max ratio of measurements to unknowns for automatic fits
tooltip = 
manpage = The minimum and maximum ratio of measurements to unknowns to be
allowed in the automatic fits.  The defaults are 4 and 20.

[Field = XSkipLeftAndRight]
short = xskip
type = IP
usage = Number of columns of patches to exclude on the left and right
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = YSkipLowerAndUpper]
short = yskip
type = IP
usage = Number of patches to exclude on the lower and upper sides in Y
tooltip = 
manpage = Number of patches to exclude on the lower and upper sides in Y.
This entry specifies either rows or slabs of patches to exclude, depending on
whether the volume is oriented so that it is thin in the Z or Y dimension.

[Field = ZSkipLowerAndUpper]
short = zskip
type = IP
usage = Number of patches to exclude on the lower and upper sides in Z
tooltip = 
manpage = Number of patches to exclude on the lower and upper sides in Z.
This entry specifies either slabs or rows of patches to exclude, depending on
whether the volume is oriented so that it is thin in the Z or Y dimension.

[Field = LocalRowsAndColumns]
short = rowcol
type = IP
usage = Number of rows and columns of patches to include in each local fit
tooltip = 
manpage = Number of rows and columns of patches to include in each local fit.
The second value will apply to the longer of the Y and the Z dimension.  If
this option is not entered, the program will automatically search for the best
warping.

[Field = LocalSlabs]
short = slabs
type = I
usage = (Minimum) number of slabs of patches to include in each local fit
tooltip = 
manpage = By default, fits include all slabs of patches in the shorter of the
Y and Z dimensions.  This entry allow fits to be done to subsets of patches in
that dimension.  If the -rowcol option is used, then this entry specifies the
number of slabs of patches to include in each fit.  Otherwise, the entry
sets the minimum number of slabs of patches that will be tried in the automatic
search for the best warping.

[Field = MaxFractionToDrop]
short = maxfrac
type = F
usage = Maximum fraction of patches to eliminate from each fit (default 0.1)
tooltip = 
manpage = Maximum fraction of patches to drop from each fit by outlier 
elimination.  Enter 0 to for no outlier elimination.  The default is 0.1.

[Field = MinResidualToDrop]
short = minresid
type = F
usage = Minimum residual for outlier elimination (default 0.5)
tooltip = 
manpage = The minimum residual for outlier elimination; patches with residuals
smaller than this value will be retained no matter how extreme they are
relative to the other patches.  The default is 0.5.

[Field = CriterionProbabilities]
short = prob
type = FP
usage = Probabilities controlling outlier elimination
tooltip = 
manpage = Two probabilities controlling outlier elimination: a criterion
probability for a patch to be evaluated as an outlier (default 0.01), and
a criterion probability for a patch to be eliminated regardless of the
distribution of extreme values (default 0.002).

[Field = DiscountIfZeroVectors]
short = discount
type = F
usage = Do not count local fits with more than this fraction of vectors zero
tooltip = 
manpage = Use this option to ignore local fits that have many zero vectors when
computing the average mean residual and the average maximum residual.  This
will prevent misleading averages when analyzing the warping fields used to
align adjacent volumes for stitching.  Fits with the number of zero vectors
bigger than the given fraction of the total vectors will be excluded from the
averages.

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.

[Field = usage]
short = help
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage =
