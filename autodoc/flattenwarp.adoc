[Field = InputFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input model file with contours delineating section
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output file for warping transformations
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = PatchOutputFile]
short = patch
type = FN
usage = Output text file for patch vectors
tooltip = 
manpage = Output text file for patch vectors that can be converted to a model
with patch2imod(1).

[Field = BinningOfTomogram]
short = binning
type = I
usage = Binning of tomogram that model was built on relative to tomogram to be
warped
tooltip = 
manpage = Binning of tomogram that model was built on, relative to the
tomoagrm to be warped.  Positions and vectors
will be scaled up by this amount so that the transformations can be validly
applied to the unbinned tomogram.

[Field = OneSurface]
short = one
type = B
usage = Contours are on one surface of the section, rather than in the middle
tooltip = 
manpage = Use this option to indicate that all contours are on one surface of
the section rather than in the middle.  With this option, there cannot be any
paired contours.

[Field = FlipYandZ]
short = flipyz
type = I
usage = 1 to flip Y and Z coordinates, 0 not to, or -1 to flip if nz > ny
tooltip = 
manpage = This option allows control over whether the Y and Z coordinates of
the model are flipped.  By default, flipping will be done if the Z dimension
(nz) of the modeled volume is greater than the Y dimension (ny).  Enter 1
to force flipping even if this is not the case, or 0 to prevent it if this is
the case.

[Field = WarpSpacingXandY]
short = spacing
type = FP
usage = Spacing between warp positions in X and Y
tooltip = 
manpage = Spacing between warp positions in X and Y, in pixels in the tomogram
that was modeled.  By default, the program will try to make the spacing in X
and Y be 3 and 4.5 times smaller, respectively, than the minimum spacing
between contours in Y, but if that will lead to too many patches, it will make
the spacing bigger.  This option can be used to specify a spacing instead.
This may be needed if too fine a spacing leads to problems when solving the
linear equations for the shifts.

[Field = PID]
type = B
usage = Output process ID to standard error
