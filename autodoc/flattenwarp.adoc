[Field = InputFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input model file with contours or scattered points delineating section
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output file for warping transformations
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = PatchOutputFile]
short = patch
type = FN
usage = Output text file for patch vectors
tooltip = 
manpage = Output text file for patch vectors that can be converted to a model
with patch2imod(1).

[Field = MiddleContourFile]
short = middle
type = FN
usage = Output model file for average contours through middle of section
tooltip = 
manpage = Output model file for average contours through middle of section.
For an input model consisting of boundary contours, this model will contain
a contour at each Y value, derived by smoothing and sampling from the original
contour(s) at that Y value.  For input consisting of scattered points, the
scattered points object(s) will be copied to the output model.  In either
case, the model will also contain contours based on
whatever thin plate splines are fit to the data, one object per lambda value.
The model has its Z-scale set to 10, which will greatly exaggerate the Z
changes and make it easier to see the bumps in the surface that might cause
artifacts in the flattened valume.

[Field = BinningOfTomogram]
short = binning
type = IP
usage = X/Y and Z binning of tomogram that model was built on relative to
tomogram to be warped
tooltip = 
manpage = Binning in X/Y, and binning in Z, of image file that model was built
on, relative to the tomogram to be warped.  Positions and vectors will be
scaled up by this amount so that the transformations can be validly
applied to the unbinned tomogram.  For contours or scattered points modeled on
a tomogram, this option is needed only if the tomogram
file itself is binned down, not if an unbinned tomogram is read into 3dmod
with binning.  For a fiducial model, the option is needed only if 1) the
prealigned stack was binned relative to the tomogram being warped, and 2) the
model was not rescaled to match the tomogram when it was processed with
Sortbeadsurfs(1).

[Field = OneSurface]
short = one
type = B
usage = Contours are on one surface of the section, rather than in the middle
tooltip = 
manpage = Use this option to indicate that all contours are on one surface of
the section rather than in the middle.  With this option, there cannot be any
paired contours.

[Field = FlipOption]
short = flip
type = I
usage = 1 to flip Y and Z coordinates, 0 not to, or 2 to rotate around X
tooltip = 
manpage = This option allows control over whether the Y and Z coordinates of
the model are flipped.  By default, if the Z dimension
(nz) of the modeled volume is greater than the Y dimension (ny), a contour
model will be flipped, and a scattered point model will be rotated around the
X axis.  For a scattered point model, this operation follows a flipping that
might be needed to make the model match the native orientation of the volume.
Enter 1 to force flipping even if ny > nz and even for a scattered point
model, or 0 to prevent rotation or flipping even if nz > ny, or 2 to force
rotation of a scattered point model even if ny > nz.

[Field = WarpSpacingXandY]
short = spacing
type = FP
usage = Spacing between warp positions in X and Y
tooltip = 
manpage = Spacing between warp positions in X and Y, in pixels in the tomogram
that was modeled.  By default, with contour data, the program will try to make
the spacing in X and Y be 4.5 and 3 times smaller, respectively, than the
minimum spacing
between contours in Y.  With scattered point data, it will try to make the
spacing in both X and Y be 3 times smaller than the average spacing between
points.  In either case, if that will lead to too many patches, it will make
the spacing bigger.  This option can be used to specify a spacing instead.
This may be needed if too fine a spacing leads to problems when solving the
linear equations for the shifts.

[Field = LambdaForSmoothing]
short = lambda
type = FA
usage = Log of lambda values for thin plate smoothing of the surface
tooltip =
manpage = One or more values to control the amount of smoothing in the
thin plate spline (TPS).  The values are the log of the lambda parameter.  If
one value is entered, the program will go on to compute warping transforms.
If multiple values are entered in order to assess their effect, an output
model must be specified with -middle, but no transforms will be computed and
no output file is needed for them.  Values varying in steps of 0.5 will
produce useful changes in smoothing.
Negative values are just as meaningful as positive ones.

[Field = CriterionForOutliers]
short = criterion
type = F
usage = Criterion for dropping scattered points (multiple of median deviation)
tooltip =
manpage = Criterion for dropping scattered points from the fit for the thin
plate spline.  The fit is done first with all points, the deviation from
the spline surface is computed for each point, and the median absolute
value of the difference from the median deviation is determined.  This value
is the "normalized median absolute deviation", referred to as MADN, and is
similar to a standard deviation.  Points whose difference from the 
median deviation, divided by the MADN, is greater than this criterion are
eliminated and the spline is fit again.  Values of around 2.5-3 will eliminate
a useful number of points.

[Field = ShowContours]
short = show
type = B
usage = Set properties in output model to show contours instead of surfaces
tooltip = 
manpage = Set object properties in the output model so that contours will
appear for all objects in 3dmodv.  By default, the properties are set so that
all objects based on smoothing with a TPS will display a meshed
surface instead of a spline, but only the first such object will be turned on.

[Field = RestoreOrientation]
short = restore
type = B
usage = Put the output model in same orientation as input model
tooltip = 
manpage = Put the output model back into the same orientation as the input
model.  By default, it is left in an orientation so that it can be viewed in
3dmodv(3) with the Z scale applied to the correct axis.  You may need to use
this option if you want to load this model onto a tomogram.

[Field = PID]
type = B
usage = Output process ID to standard error
tooltip = 
manpage =
