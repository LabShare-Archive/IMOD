a stretch along a 45-degree line between the axes.  A component of stretch 
parallel to the axes cannot be distinguished from a stretch of the 3D fiducial
coordinates parallel to the axes, so as of IMOD 3.10.7 only this skew

the final image rotation.

[Field = BeamTiltOption]

usage = Type of beam tilt solution: 0 for none, 1 to include in fit, 2 to

tooltip = 
manpage = Type of solution for non-perpendicularity between tilt axis and beam
axis, referred to as beam tilt:
^  0 for beam tilt fixed at the initial value,
^  1 to include beam tilt as a variable in the minimization procedure,
^  2 to perform the minimization at a series of fixed beam tilt values and
search for the value that gives the smallest error.
^Because some variables can covary with the beam tilt to give nearly equivalent
solutions, the second option for finding the beam tilt gives more reliable
results.  Some combinations of variable simply cannot be solved for, in
particular the stretch variables and rotation together with beam tilt; either
omit the stretch variables or solve for a single rotation angle.  Note that
only the component of the beam tilt around the X axis is solved for; the
component around the Y axis is indistinguishable from a change in tilt angle.
When the beam tilt is non-zero, either as a result of a search or because a
fixed value was entered, its effect is expressed as a varying tilt around the
X axis and a modification of the tilt angles and in-plane image rotations.
Thus, a file of X-tilt angles should be output when beam tilt is included in
the solution.

the default is 0 for all of the local option values.

[Field = NumberOfLocalPatchesXandY]

usage = Number of local patches in X and Y for local solutions
tooltip = Number of overlapping local areas to use in the X and Y directions.
manpage = Number of local patches in X and in Y in which to obtain a solution
from the fiducials located in that patch.  If this option is entered,
overlapping patches will be set up that fill the image area.

[Field = TargetPatchSizeXandY]
short = 
type = IP
usage = Target minimum size for local patches in X and Y 
tooltip = Target for the minimum size of local areas in the X and Y directions.
manpage = Target for the size of local patches in X and Y in which to obtain a
solution from the fiducials located in that patch.  The number of patches will
be set so that patches smaller or up to 5% larger than this size and
overlapping by a fixed amount will fill the range occupied by fiducials (not
the image area).  The patches on the edges should not have to expand as much
as when the patch centers are set up to fill the image area.  If this option
is entered, NumberOfLocalPatchesXandY must not be entered, and
MinSizeOrOverlapXandY must specify an overlap instead of a size.

[Field = MinSizeOrOverlapXandY]
short =

overlap (if < 1)

between patches, in the X and Y directions.

is an overlap of 0.5.

usage = Minimum total number of fiducials, and minimum number present on each
surface if two surfaces exist
tooltip = Minimum total number of fiducials required in each local area, and
minimum on each surface if two surfaces were analyzed for.
manpage = Minimum total number of fiducials, and minimum number present on each
surface if two surfaces were assumed in the analysis of
surfaces.  A patch will be expanded about its center until it
contains enough points to meet both of these criteria.

[Field = FixXYZCoordinates]
short = 
type = B
usage = Fix the X-Y-Z coordinates of the fiducials at their global values 
tooltip = 
manpage = Fix the X-Y-Z coordinates of the fiducials at their values from the
global solution; the default is to solve for them independently
in each local area.  For more on the implications of this option, see the note
above in the section on local alignments.

high residual output

alignment: 
^  1 to output the values of the parameters for each view or 0 not to;
