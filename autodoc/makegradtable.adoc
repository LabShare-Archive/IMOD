[Field = FindgradFile]
short = findgrad
type = FN
usage = Input file with output from Findgradient
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = TransformFile]
short = xffile
type = FN
usage = Input file with transforms for image pairs from stage moves in Z
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = IntensityFile]
short = intensity 
type = FN
usage = File with intensity values from extracttilts -int
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = OutputTable]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output file for mag gradient table
tooltip = 
manpage = Output file for mag gradient table.  If this option is not entered,
the first non-option argument will be taken as the name of the output file.

[Field = RawOutput]
short = raw
type = FN
usage = Output file for raw, smoothed, and extrapolated data
tooltip = 
manpage = Output file for raw, smoothed, and extrapolated data.  If this
option is not entered, the same data will be printed to standard output.  
The columns in this output are: a type identifier (1 for measured and 2 for
extrapolated data), intensity, transformed intensity, the raw and smoothed
percent magnification change per micron, and the raw and smoothed degrees of
rotation per micron.

[Field = CrossoverIntensity]
short = crossover 
type = F
usage = Underlying intensity value at crossover (required)
tooltip = 
manpage = Underlying intensity value at crossover.  For an FEI microscope,
this is not the intensity value that appears in the user interface but the
intensity used internally, which is saved in SerialEMcalibrations.txt when
crossover is calibrated in SerialEM.  This entry is required.

[Field = MicronsMoved]
short = microns
type = F
usage = Number of microns of stage movement in Z (default 10)
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = SmoothMags]
short = msmooth
type = B
usage = Smooth magnification changes with linear fits
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = SmoothRotations]
short = rsmooth
type = B
usage = Smooth rotation changes with linear fits
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = MaxInFitForSmoothing]
short = sfit
type = IP
usage = Max number of points in fits for smoothing mags and rotations
tooltip = 
manpage = Maximum number of points in fits for smoothing mags and rotations.
If one of these values is 0, a line will be fit to all points on one side of
crossover and the smoothed values will be the values in this line.  Otherwise,
for each point, a line is fit to the nearest points up to this maximum number,
and the value of the line is used as the smoothed value at that intensity.
The default is 5 for magnifications and 0 for rotations.

[Field = MaxInFitForExtrapolation]
short = efit 
type = IP
usage = Max number of points in fits for extrapolating mags and rotations
tooltip = 
manpage = Maximum number of points in fits for extrapolating mags and
rotations.  With the default values of 0, a line will be fit to all points on
one side of crossover and the line will be extrapolated both toward crossover
and to more extreme intensities.  Otherwise, a line will be fit to the given
number of points at the end of the curve, and this line will be used to find
the extrapolated value at that end of the curve.

[Field = ExtremesForExtrapolation]
short = extremes
type = FP
usage = Extreme values to extrapolate to (default 0.2 and 0.8)
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = DistanceFromCrossover]
short = distance
type = F
usage = Relative distance from crossover to extrapolate to (default 0.5)
tooltip = 
manpage = Use this entry to specify how close to crossover to extrapolate the
curves to.  The number is expressed as a fraction of the distance from
crossover to the last measured intensity on the particular side of crossover,
where the intensities are transformed as given above.  Typically, with the
default fraction of 0.5, the extrapolated gradient will be twice what it is at
the last measured intensity.

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.

[Field = usage]
short = help
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage = Print help output.
