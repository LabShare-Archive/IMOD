[Field = InputFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input image file to bin down in 3D

[Field = SlicesMinAndMax]
short = slices
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending slices to analyze in Z (numbered from 1)
tooltip =
manpage = Starting and ending slices to analyze in Z, numbered from 1.
The default is to do all slices.

[Field = XMinAndMax]
short = xminmax
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending coordinates to analyze in X
tooltip =
manpage = Starting and ending coordinates to analyze in X, numbered from 0.  
The default is to omit borders equal to 10% of the X dimension. 

[Field = YMinAndMax]
short = yminmax
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending coordinates to analyze in Y
tooltip =
manpage = Starting and ending coordinates to analyze in Y, numbered from 0.
The default is to omit borders equal to 10% of the Y dimension. 

[Field = FlipYandZ]
short = flipyz
type = B
usage = Treat coordinates as coming from volume flipped in 3dmod
tooltip = 
manpage = Treat coordinates as coming from a volume that was read into 3dmod
with Y and Z sizes flipped with the -Y option.  Thus, for a newly created
tomogram loaded into 3dmod flipped, you can use this option to enter X, Y, and
Z coordinates read out from 3dmod.  The program assumes that
flipping occurred by rotating around the X axis, unless the "-old" option is given.

[Field = OldFlipping]
short = oldflip
type = B
usage = Flipping was done with swapping of X and Y axes, not rotation around X.
tooltip = 
manpage = Flipped coordinates are based on flipping by swapping X and Y axes,
not by rotating around X.  This flipping occurred prior to IMOD 4.6.18.

[Field = TruncateBlackAndWhite]
short = truncate
type = IP
usage = Number of pixels to truncate as black and white
tooltip = 
manpage = Number of pixels to truncate as black and white in the analyzed 
volume.  The default is one pixel per slice or one pixel per million,
whichever is greater.

[Field = usage]
short = help
type = B
usage = Print help output
