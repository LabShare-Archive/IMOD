[Field = InputFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input model file
tooltip = 
manpage = Input model file from which transforms will be found.  If this
option is not entered, the first non-option argument will be used.

[Field = FOutputFile]
short = foutput
type = FN
usage = Output file for list of section-to-section (f) transforms
tooltip = 
manpage = Output file for list of f transforms, which align each section to
the previous one.  If this
option is not entered, the second non-option argument will be used.

[Field = GOutputFile]
short = goutput
type = FN
usage = Output file for list of global transforms for Finishjoin
tooltip = 
manpage = Output file for list of global transforms that can be supplied to 
Finishjoin(1), adjusted for any offsets used when making the join file that 
was modeled.  This entry is required unless not outputting transforms for every
slice, in which case it must be omitted.  If this option is not entered, the
third non-option argument will be used.

[Field = EditExistingFile]
short = edit
type = B
usage = Use transforms in existing file for boundaries not being aligned
tooltip = 
manpage = If the specified output file for f transforms exists, read 
transforms from it and use those them for any boundaries not being aligned.
This option allows the program to be run repeatedly, computing transforms
for a subset of boundaries each time.

[Field = SliceTransforms]
short = slice
type = B
usage = Output transforms for every slice of join file
tooltip = 
manpage = Output transforms for every slice of joined tomogram that was
modeled.  Use this option if you plan to transform the joined file instead of
rerunning Finishjoin(1).

[Field = JoinFileOrSizeXYZ]
short = join
type = FN
usage = Joined tomogram that was modeled, or its size in X, Y, Z (optional)
tooltip =
manpage = Joined tomogram that model was built on, or its size in X, Y, and Z.
If this option is not entered, 
entered, the image X and Y size will be used from the model header.

[Field = SizesOfSections]
short = sizes
type = IA
usage = Number of slices in each section of joined file
tooltip = 
manpage =

[Field = ZValuesOfBoundaries]
short = zvalues
type = IA
usage = Z value of last slice before each boundary (numbered from 1)
tooltip = 
manpage = Z value of last slice before each boundary (numbered from 1).
Either this entry or the sizes of the sections must be entered.  If this
option and the -slice option are used, then a -join entry is also needed to
inform the program of the full Z size of the file.

[Field = OffsetOfJoin]
short = offset
type = IP
usage = Offset applied in making the join file (negative of shift)
tooltip = 
manpage = Offset applied in making the join file that was modeled.  This is
the same as the offset entry to Finishjoin(1), and the negative of the shift
values that appear in eTomo.

[Field = BinningOfJoin]
short = binning
type = I
usage = Binning used to make the join file that was modeled
tooltip = 
manpage =

[Field = ReferenceSection]
short = refsec
type = I
usage = Reference section that was not transformed in the join, numbered from 1
tooltip = 
manpage =

[Field = TranslationOnly]
short = transonly
type = B
usage = Solve only for translations in X and Y
tooltip =
manpage = Solve for transformations that include only translations in X and Y.

[Field = RotationTranslation]
short = rottrans
type = B
usage = Solve for rotations and translations
tooltip =
manpage = Solve for transformations that include rotations and translations,
which requires at least 2 points at each boundary.

[Field = MagRotTrans]
short = magrot
type = B
usage = Solve for magnifications, rotations, and translations
tooltip =
manpage = Solve for transformations that include magnifications, rotations 
and translations, i.e. no stretch.  These solutions require at least 3 points
at each boundary.  If none of of these three options is
given, the default is to solve for a full linear transformation, which
requires at least 4 points.

[Field = BoundariesToAnalyze]
short = boundaries
type = LI
usage = Boundaries to find transformations across (numbered from 1)
tooltip =
manpage = List of boundaries to find transformations across, numbered from 1.
The default is to do all boundaries.

[Field = PointsToFit]
short = points
type = IP
usage = Maximum and minimum number of points to fit on each side of boundary
tooltip = 
manpage = Maximum and minimum number of points to fit on each side of
boundary.  If a contour contains the minimum number of points in each of the
sections forming a boundary, then lines will be fit separately to the points
on each side.  The number of points in each fit is limited by the given
maximum value.  A contour is ignored at a particular boundary if it has fewer
than the minimum number of points in the section on either side, unless it
has just one point on each side.  The defaults are 5 and 2.

[Field = GapStartEndInc]
short = gap
type = FT
usage = Starting and ending gap size to try between sections, and increment
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending gap size to try between sections, and increment
between gap sizes.  The gap sizes can be negative or positive.  Only one gap
size will be used if the ending value equals the starting value or the
increment is 0.  The default is 0,0,0.

[Field = ObjectsToInclude]
short = objects
type = LI
usage = Objects to include in the fits
tooltip = 
manpage =

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.

[Field = usage]
short = help
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage =
