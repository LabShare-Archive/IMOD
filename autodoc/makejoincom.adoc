[Field = RootName]
short = root
type = CH
usage = Rootname for info file, joined tomogram, and other files
tooltip =
manpage = Rootname for info file, joined tomogram, and other intermediate files.
If this option is not entered, the last non-option argument will be
taken as the root name.

[Field = InputTomogram]
short = input
type = FNM
usage = Input tomogram from one section
tooltip =
manpage = Input tomogram from one section.  If this option is used to enter any
tomogram name, it must be used for all of them.  If the option is not entered, the
first and following non-option arguments will be used for the entries.  

[SectionHeader = LinkedOptions]
usage = OPTIONS THAT APPLY TO INDIVIDUAL TOMOGRAMS
manpage = OPTIONS THAT APPLY TO INDIVIDUAL TOMOGRAMS
^  These options apply only to a single tomogram.  All such options should be
entered before the tomogram name is entered.  The name can be entered either
with the -input option or as a non-option argument at the command line, but in
either case it must be entered after all of the options that apply to it, and
before the options that apply to the next tomogram.

[Field = TopSlices]
short = top
type = IPL
usage = Starting and ending slices of sample from top of section
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending slices of sample from top of section.  "Top"
does not necessarily mean high Z; it is the end of the Z range that is
contiguous to the next section.  This option must be entered for all but the
last section.

[Field = BottomSlices]
short = bottom
type = IPL
usage = Starting and ending slices of sample from bottom of section
tooltip =
manpage = Starting and ending slices of sample from bottom of section.
"Bottom" means the end of the Z range that is contiguous to the previous
section.  This option must be entered for all but the first section.

[Field = FlipYandZ]
short = flip
type = BL
usage = Flip Y and Z of tomogram to make X/Y be in plane of section
tooltip =
manpage = Flip Y and Z of tomogram to make X/Y be in plane of section.  This
option will invert handedness. 

[Field = RotateByAngles]
short = rotate
type = FTL
usage = Run Rotatevol on tomogram with given rotation around X, Y, and Z axes
tooltip =
manpage = Run Rotatevol on tomogram with given rotation around X, Y, and Z
axes, or just take account of this rotation if the -already option is entered. 

[Field = AlreadyRotated]
short = already
type = BL
usage = Rotatevol was already run with the rotations entered with -rotate
tooltip =
manpage = 

[Field = XYZsizeForRotation]
short = xyzsize
type = ITL
usage = Set output size from Rotatevol to given values in X, Y, Z
tooltip =
manpage = Set output size from Rotatevol to given values in X, Y, Z for this
section.

[Field = FullSizeRotation]
short = fullsize
type = BL
usage = Set Rotatevol output size to maximum needed to hold whole volume
tooltip =
manpage = Set Rotatevol output size to the maximum needed to hold the whole
rotated section in X, Y, and Z

[Field = MaxXYsizeForRotation]
short = maxxysize
type = BL
usage = Set Rotatevol output size in X and Y only to maximum needed to hold volume
tooltip =
manpage = Set Rotatevol output size in X and Y only to the maximum needed to
hold this rotated section; some portions of the original tomogram will be out
of range in Z, but those are probably portions that have no sectioned material
in them.

[SectionHeader = GeneralOptions]
usage = GENERAL OPTIONS
manpage = GENERAL OPTIONS
^  These options are entered only once and can appear anywhere among the other
entries.

[Field = DirectoryOfSource]
short = dir
type = FN
usage = Default directory for source tomograms
tooltip =
manpage = Default directory for source tomograms.  If this option is entered,
tomograms that do not include a directory in their path will be sought in the
given directory instead of the current directory.

[Field = SourceExtension]
short = srcext
type = CH
usage = Default extension for original tomograms (default is "rec")
tooltip =
manpage = It is possible to enter filenames without extensions, in which case
a default extension will be attached.  This option sets the default, which is
otherwise "rec".  This is an unsafe option to use because no extension will be
attached to a filename that has a dot in it before the extension.

[Field = TemporaryExtension]
short = tmpext
type = CH
usage = Default extension for temporary tomograms (flipped or rotated, default
tmp)
tooltip =
manpage = When a flipped or rotated file is created, a different extension is
attached to it, which is "tmp" by default.  Use this option to change the
extension.

[Field = ReferenceForDensity]
short = reference 
type = I
usage = Tomogram to use as reference for density scaling (numbered from 1)
tooltip =
manpage = Tomogram to use as the reference for density scaling (numbered from
1).  This tomogram will be unscaled in the joined file and others will be
scaled to match.  In addition, the mode of this tomogram will be used for the
mode of the joined file.  The default is 1.

[Field = MidasSizeLimit]
short = midaslim
type = I
usage = Size to which samples will be squeezed for Midas if bigger than this.
tooltip =
manpage = Size to which sample slices will be squeezed for aligning in
Midas(1), if they are larger than the given sizein X or Y.  The default is
1024.  Sampled slices will be scaled down with antialiasing using the -shrink
option in Newstack(1).

[Field = TestMode]
short = test
type = B
usage = Do not run anything that requires complete image files
tooltip =
manpage = Do not run anything that requires complete image files,
specifically, Densmatch(1).
