[Field = TrackCommandFile]
short = track
type = FN
usage = Command file for running Beadtrack
tooltip =
manpage = Command file for running Beadtrack(1).  This entry is required as the
command file is used both for tracking points found by Imodfindbeads and to
obtain several parameters.

[Field = MinGuessNumBeads]
short = guess
type = I
usage = A guess for the minimum number of beads per section
tooltip = 
manpage = A guess for the minimum number of beads per section.  This entry may
sometimes be required to help Imodfindbeads find a dip in the histogram,
especially if there are very few beads.

[Field = MinSpacing]
short = spacing
type = F
usage = Minimum spacing between peaks as fraction of bead size (default 0.85)
tooltip = 
manpage = Minimum spacing between peaks found in Imodfindbeads(1), as a
fraction of the bead size.  When two peaks are closer than this distance
apart, the weaker one is eliminated. The default is 0.85, since values of 0.8
to 0.9 are helpful for getting a more complete set of beads.

[Field = BeadSize]
short = size
type = F
usage = Diameter of beads in images to track, in pixels
tooltip =
manpage = Diameter of beads in the images to track, in pixels.  This entry is
not needed if there is a bead size entry in the Beadtrack(1) command file, but
would be needed if there is only a centroid radius entry there.  It could also
be used to enter an alternate size to use in Imodfindbeads(1).
If it is entered, it must be in units of the potentially binned pixels of the
stack being tracked.

[Field = NumberOfSeedViews]
short = views
type = I
usage = Number of views at which to find seed points for tracking beads
tooltip = 
manpage = Number of views at which to find seed points for tracking beads.
The program runs Imodfindbeads on this number of views and then runs beadtrack
independently for each view with a seed model of all the points found on that
view.  The default is for the program to try 3 views, then run Imodfindbeads
again with 5 or 7 views with if there not enough candidate points found by
Imodfindbeads.  With this option, the program to run Imodfindbeads just once
with the given number of views.

[Field = BoundaryModel]
short = boundary
type = FN
usage = Model containing contours enclosing areas in which to find beads
tooltip =
manpage = Name of model file whose first object contains contours enclosing
areas in which to find beads.  If more than one contour is drawn on a view,
points inside any one of the contours will be accepted.  Contours should be
drawn in the zero-tilt view, as those will govern the final selection by
Pickbestseed.  In Imodfindbeads, when peaks are examined on a view, contours
on the nearest view are used, so contours can be drawn on other views if
necessary to further constrain the areas examined at that stage.

[Field = BordersInXandY]
short = border
type = IP
usage = Number of pixels to exclude on each side in X and in Y
tooltip = 
manpage = Number of pixels to exclude from consideration on each side in X and
in Y.  The default is based on the average of the X and Y sizes of the image;
it is 32 pixels per 1024 up to a size of 2048, plus 24 pixels per 1024 above
2048 pixels.

[Field = TwoSurfaces]
short = two
type = B
usage = Try to find an equal number of beads on two surfaces
tooltip =
manpage = Try to sort beads onto two surfaces then select a seed model that
has equal numbers of beads on the two surfaces if possible.

[Field = TargetNumberOfBeads]
short = number
type = I
usage = Desired total number of beads to choose for final seed model
tooltip =
manpage = Desired total number of beads to choose for final seed model.  If
beads are on two surfaces, the program will seek to find half the target number
on each surface, then pick more beads on either surface to reach the taget.
Either this option or -density must be entered.

[Field = TargetDensityOfBeads]
short = density
type = F
usage = Desired density of beads in final seed model per 1000 square pixels 
tooltip =
manpage = Desired density of beads in final seed model per 1000 square pixels
of area, excluding the area outside boundary contours if any.  This option
provides an alternative way of specifying the target that is independent of
data set size.

[Field = MaxMajorToMinorRatio]
short = ratio
type = F
usage = Maximum ratio between beads on majority and minority surface
tooltip =
manpage = Maximum ratio between number of beads on the surface with more beads
and the number on the ohter surface.  If this ratio is exceeded after running
Pickbestseed, the target is revised and Pickbetseed is run again.  The default
is no limit, which means that the program will seek to reach the target nunber
of beads regardless of the imbalance between surfaces.

[Field = ClusteredPointsAllowed]
short = cluster
type = I
usage = 1 to include beads near others, 2-4 to include elongated beads also
tooltip =
manpage = This option is used to allow two kinds of less desirable beads to be
included: ones close to other beads, and ones that are elongated or overlap
another bead over most of the views that they are tracked in.  Enter 1 to
include clustered beads. i.e, ones that appear to be located within 2
diameters of other beads, where foreshortening perpendicular to the tilt axis
is taken into account in computing this separation.  Only one of a pair of
clustered points will be accepted.  Enter 2, 3, or 4 to include
beads identified as elongated in up to 1/3, up to 2/3, or all of the beadtrack
runs, respectively.

[Field = LowerTargetForClustered]
short = lower
type = F
usage = Include clustered points only if # of beads is still below this target
tooltip =
manpage = Include clustered and elongated points as allowed by the -cluster
option only when the total number of beads is still below the reduced target
given here.  The value entered should be in the same form as the regular
target was specified, i.e, a number of beads if -number was entered or a bead
density if -density was entered.

[Field = SubareaSize]
short = subarea
type = I
usage = Size of subareas for Sortbeadsurfs analysis of two surfaces
tooltip = 
manpage = Size of subareas within which Sortbeadsurfs(1) should analyze for two
surfaces.  This option and the -sort option cannot be used together.  By
default the -sort option is passed to Sortbeadsurfs(1).

[Field = SortAreasMinNumAndSize]
short = sort
type = IP
usage = Minimum bead number and area size for having Sortbeadsurfs pick subareas
tooltip = 
manpage = Minimum bead number and area size for having Sortbeadsurfs pick
subareas.  With these parameters, Sortbeadsurfs will divide the area occupied
by points into equal-sized areas that are at least the given minimum size in
each dimension, and that have at least the given number of points.  The
default is 50 beads and 2500 pixels.

[Field = PickSeedOptions]
short = pick
type = CH
usage = One or more options to pass to Pickbestseed
tooltip =
manpage = Additional options to pass to Pickbestseed.  The entry should be a single
string (quoted when running from the command line) that contains the text that
would be entered directly to Pickbestseed, for example, "-ver 1 -phase -con 6,2". 

[Field = RemoveTempFiles]
short = remove
type = I
usage = Clean up temporary files from previous run and go on (1) or exit (-1)
tooltip =
manpage = Clean up the temporary files that are retained between runs so that
Pickbestseed can be rerun without finding and tracking beads again.  Enter 1
to remove these files and go on to a new run, or -1 simply to remove the files
and exit.

[Field = OutputSeedModel]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Alternative path and name for output file for the seed model
tooltip =
manpage = Output file name for saving the seed model, instead of using the
name from the Beadtrack command file.

[Field = InfoFile]
short = info
type = FN
usage = Alternative path and name for info file
tooltip =
manpage = File name for the info file that is written on a first run and read
on later runs.  The default info file is written in the current directory with 
the name autofidseeda.info if the root of the Beadtrack command file name ends
in "a", autofidseedb.info it it ends in "b", otherwise autofidseed.info.

[Field = LeaveTempFiles]
short = leave
type = B
usage = Leave temporary files in temporary directory
tooltip =
manpage = For diagnosing problems, leave temporary files that would ordinarily
be deleted in the standard
temporary directory (/usr/tmp, /tmp, or defined by IMOD_TMPDIR) or in the
current directory if there is no temporary directory.
