[Field = InputStack]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input stack whose defocus will be estimated
tooltip =
manpage = Input stack whose defocus will be estimated.

[Field = AngleFile]
short = angleFn
type = FN
usage = File containing tilt angles for the input stack
tooltip =
manpage = File containing tilt angles for the input stack.  Each line of this
file is the tilt angle for a view of the input stack.  The angles are listed
in order starting from view 1.

[Field = InvertTiltAngles]
short = invert
type = B
usage = Invert the sign of the tilt angles
tooltip =
manpage = Invert the sign of the tilt angles to compensate for a left-handed 
coordinate system in the microscope.  When the sign of the tilt angles and 
the value of the tilt axis rotation angle are such that reconstructions are
generated with inverted handedness, then this option is needed to keep power 
spectra for off-center tiles from being shifted in the wrong direction.  One
way to assess this need is to examine the images in a stack aligned for
reconstruction, with the tilt axis vertical.  At positive tilt angles, the
right side of the images should be more underfocused than the left side; if
not, then this option is needed.

[Field = OffsetToAdd]
short = offset
type = F
usage = Add this value to the data in the input stack
tooltip =
manpage = The program must analyze data values where 0 corresponds to no
electrons recorded.  Use this option to specify a value to add to your input
stack that will make values positive and proportional to recorded electrons.
The value will not be added to noise files; they are required to be positive.
The program automatically sets this value to 32768 if it recognizes a file from
FEI data acquisition software with a minimum below 0, or if the minimum and
mean of a non-FEI file are sufficiently negative.

[Field = ConfigFile]
short = config
type = FN
usage = File with a list of noise files used to estimate the noise
tooltip = 
manpage = The configure file specifies the noise files used to estimate the
noise floor, one file per line.  The files can be specified with either
absolute paths or with paths relative to the location of the configure file
itself.

[Field = DefocusFile]
short = defFn
type = FN
usage = File to store found defocuses
tooltip = 
manpage = File to store found defocuses.  Each entry in the file will consist
of the starting and ending view number of the range of views being fit to
(numbered from 1), the starting and ending angle of the tilt angle range being
fit to, and the defocus value in nanometers (underfocus positive).  When the
program writes a new defocus file, it puts a version number (currently 2) at
the end of the first line.  If this file already exists when the program
starts, it will be read in and the results displayed in a table in the Angle
Range and Tile Selection dialog. The previous version will become a backup
file (with ~ added to its name) when new results are saved to this file.  If
you supply an initial defocus file with more than line, be sure to use the
exact angles from the tilt angle file specified with -angleFn; do not round to
one decimal place.  Alternatively, add the number "2" as an extra value at the
end of the first line of the file; this will prevent the program from thinking
that the view numbers might be off by one.

[Field = AxisAngle]
short = aAngle
type = F
usage = Specifies how much the tilt axis deviates from vertical (Y axis)
tooltip =
manpage = Specifies how much the tilt axis deviates from vertical (Y axis). 
This angle is in degrees.  It follows the right hand rule and 
counter-clockwise is positive. 

[Field = PSResolution]
short = psRes
type = I
usage = The number of points over which CTF will be computed (default 101)
tooltip =
manpage = The number of points over which CTF will be computed.  The Nyquist 
frequency is divided into equal intervals delineated by these points.  The default
is 101.

[Field = TileSize]
short = tileSize
type = I
usage = The tile size each strip will be tessellated into (default 256)
tooltip =
manpage = The tile size each strip will be tessellated into.  The size is in
pixels and the tiles are square.  Each view is first divided into strips 
that are considered to have constant defocus.  The deafult is 256.

[Field = Voltage]
short = volt
type = I
usage = Microscope voltage in kV 
tooltip =
manpage = Microscope voltage in kV.

[Field = MaxCacheSize ]
short = cache
type = I
usage = cache size for tile power spectra in megabytes
tooltip =
manpage = To speed up computation, ctfplotter uses a cache to hold the
rotationally averaged power spectra of individual tiles at 20 times the final
power spectrum resolution.  This option controls the cache size.  The default
value is 1000 megabytes, which should be enough for all slices in a 4Kx4K tilt
series with the default tile size.

[Field = SphericalAberration]
short = cs
type = F
usage = Microscope spherical aberration in millimeters
tooltip =
manpage = Microscope spherical aberration in millimeters.  A value of 0 can be
entered; it will be made slightly larger to prevent division by 0 in the CTF
equations.

[Field = DefocusTol]
short = defTol
type = I
usage = Defocus tolerance in nanometers defining the center strips (default 200)
tooltip =
manpage = Defocus tolerance in nanometers defining the center strips.  The
center strips are taken from the 
central region of a view that has defocus difference less than this tolerance.
These kind of center strips from all views within AngleRange 
are considered to have a constant defocus and are used to compute the initial
CTF after being further tessellated into tiles.  The default is 200.

[Field = PixelSize]
short = pixelSize
type = F
usage = Image pixel size in nanometers
tooltip =
manpage = Image pixel size in nanometers.

[Field = AmplitudeContrast]
short = ampContrast
type = F
usage = The fraction of amplitude contrast (default 0.07)
tooltip =
manpage = The fraction of amplitude contrast. For Cryo-EM, 
it should be between 0.07 and 0.14.  The default is 0.07.

[Field = ExpectedDefocus]
short = expDef
type = F
usage = Expected defocus at the tilt axis in nanometers.
tooltip = Expected defocus at the tilt axis in microns, with a positive
value for underfocus
manpage = Expected defocus at the tilt axis in nanometers, with a positive
value for underfocus.  The frequency of the first zero of the CTF curve 
is first computed based on this expected defocus.  The segments of the CTF
curve of the input stack around that frequency are selected to be fitted.

[Field = LeftDefTol]
short = leftTol 
type = F
usage = Defocus tolerance in nm for strips to the left of center (default 2000)
tooltip =
manpage = Defocus tolerance in nanometers for strips to the left of 
the center strip.  When non-center strips are included in the average, strips
to the left of center are included if their defocus difference is less than 
the given value.  The default is 2000.

[Field = RightDefTol]
short = rightTol
type = F
usage = Defocus tolerance in nm for strips to the right of center (default 2000)
tooltip =
manpage = Defocus tolerance in nanometers for strips to the right of 
the center strip.  When non-center strips are included in the average, strips
to the right of center are included if their defocus difference is less than 
the given value.  The default is 2000.

[Field = AngleRange]
short = range
type = FP
usage = Starting and ending tilt angles for initial analysis or autofitting
tooltip =
manpage = When the -autoFit option is not entered, this entry sets the starting
and ending tilt angles for the initial analysis and is a required entry.  Views with a
tilt angle within this range are used to compute the CTF curve.  When -autoFit
is entered, this entry sets the extent over which steps will be taken in autofitting.

[Field = AutoFitRangeAndStep]
short = autoFit
type = FP
usage = Range of angles and step between ranges for initial autofitting
tooltip =
manpage = Do initial autofitting over the whole tilt series with the given
range of angles and step size between ranges.  A value of zero for the step
will make it fit to each single image separately, regardless of the value for
the range.  This autofitting differs from that invoked through the Angles
dialog in several respects: 1) All tiles will be used for fits; the "All
tiles" radio button will be selected at the end. 2) Three fitting iterations
will be done, with the expected defocus used the first time and the current
defocus estimate used for the next two iterations.  3) The size of the range
is determined by the parameter entered here, not by the starting and ending
angles entered with the -range option.

[Field = FrequencyRangeToFit]
short = frequency
type = FP
usage = Starting and ending frequencies of range to fit in power spectrum
tooltip =
manpage = Starting and ending frequencies of range to fit in power spectrum.
The two values will be used to set the "X1 starts" and "X2 ends" fields in the
fitting dialog.

[Field = VaryExponentInFit]
short = vary
type = B
usage = Vary exponent of CTF function when fitting a CTF-like curve
tooltip =
manpage = 

[Field = SaveAndExit]
short = save
type = B
usage = Save defocus values to file and exit after autofitting
tooltip =
manpage = Save defocus values to file and exit after autofitting.  The program
will not ask for confirmation before removing existing entries in the defocus
table.

[Field = DebugLevel ]
short = debug
type = I
usage = 0-3, debug level, 3 means printing all messages
tooltip =
manpage = Debug level, 0-3. 0: quiet.  1: user messages.  2: cache, tile
iteration messages.  3: additional fitting messages. The default is 1.

[Field = Parameter]
short = param
type = PF 
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries from this file.

[Field = FocalPairDefocusOffset]
short = fpOffset
type = F
usage = Defocus offset in nanometers for a focal pair of aligned stacks
tooltip = 
manpage = Normally, ctfplotter processes a single stack whose name is
given by InputStack. It can optionally process a pair of stacks with
identical til angles and mutually aligned projections, taken with a
constant defocus offset between them. If, for example, InputStack is 
myData.st, one could place a stack with 6 um underfocus in myData_1.st and
a stack with 2.175 um underfocus in myData_2.st and specify an
ExpectedDefocus of 6000 and a FocalPairDefocusOffset of -3825.
