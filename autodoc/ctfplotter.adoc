[Field = Parameter]
short = param
type = PF 
usage = specifies a parameter file
tooltip = 
manpage =

[Field = ConfigFile]
short = config
type = FN
usage = Configure file specifies the noise files used to estimate the noise
tooltip = 
manpage = Configure file specifies the noise files used to estimate the noise
floor. These noise files are collected at various beam intensities without 
specimen in the beam.

[Field = InputStack]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input stack whose defocus will be estimated
tooltip =
manpage = Input stack whose defocus will be estimated.

[Field = AngleFile]
short = angleFn
type = FN
usage = File contains tilt angles for the input stack
tooltip =
manpage =Each line of this file is the tilt angle for a slice of the input
stack. The angles are listed in order starting from slice 1.

[Field = AxisAngle]
short = aAngle
type = F
usage = Specifies how much the tilt axis  deviates from vertical (Y axis)
tooltip =
manpage = Specifies how much the tilt axis deviates from vertical (Y axis). 
This angle is in degrees. It follows the right hand rule and 
counter-clockwise is positive. 

[Field = DefocusFile]
short = defFn
type = FN
usage = File to store found defocuses
tooltip = 
manpage = File to store found defocuses

[Field = PSResolution]
short = psRes
type = I
usage = The number of points on which CTF will be computed 
tooltip =
manpage = The number of points on which CTF will be computed. The Nyquist 
frequency is divided into equal intervals delineated by these points

[Field = TileSize]
short = tileSize
type = I
usage = The tile size each strip will be tessellated into
tooltip =
manpage = The tile size each strip will be tessellate into.  The size is in
pixels and the tiles are square. Each slice is first divided into strips 
that are considered to have constant defocus.

[Field = Voltage]
short = volt
type = I
usage = Microscope voltage in Kv 
tooltip =
manpage = Microscope voltage in Kv.

[Field = SphericalAberration]
short = cs
type = F
usage = Microscope spherical aberration in millimeters
tooltip =
manpage = Microscope spherical aberration in millimeters

[Field = DefocusTol]
short = defTol
type = I
usage = Defocus tolerance in nanometers defines the center strips
tooltip =
manpage = Defocus tolerance defines the center strips. The center region of a
slice that has defocus difference less than this tolerance is defined as
center strips. This kind of center strips from all slices within AngleRange 
are considered to have a constant defocus and are used to compute the initial
CTF after being further tessellated into tiles.

[Field = PixelSize]
short = pixelSize
type = F
usage = Image pixel size in nanometers
tooltip =
manpage =  Image pixel size in nanometers.

[Field = AmplitudeContrast]
short = ampContrast
type = F
usage = The percentage of amplitude contrast.
tooltip =
manpage = The percentage of amplitude contrast. For Cryo-EM, 
it should be between 0.07 and 0.14

[Field = ExpectedDefocus]
short = expDef
type = F
usage = Expected defocus at the tilt axis in nanometers.
tooltip =
manpage = Expected defocus at the tilt axis in nanometers. The frequency 
the first zero of the CTF curve with the expected defocus is located at 
is first computed. The segments of the CTF curve of the input stack around 
that frequency are selected to be fitted.

[Field = LeftDefTol]
short = leftTol 
type = F
usage = Defocus tolerance in nanometers defines strips to the left of 
the center strip
tooltip =
manpage = Defocus tolerance in namometers defines strips to the left of 
the center strip. Those left strips have defocus difference less than 
leftDefTol.  

[Field = RightDefTol]
short = rightTol
type = F
usage = Defocus tolerance in nanometers defines strips to the right of 
the center strip
tooltip =
manpage = Defocus tolerance in nanometers defines strips to the right of 
the center strip. Those right strips have defocus difference less than
rightDefTol  

[Field = AngleRange]
short = range
type = FP
usage = Tilt angles in degrees define a range 
tooltip =
manpage = Tilt angles in degrees define a range. Slices with tilt angle within
this range are used to compute the CTF curve.
