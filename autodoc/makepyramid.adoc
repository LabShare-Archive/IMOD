Version = 1.0
Pip = 1

[Field = InputFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input image file to make pyramid from (required)
tooltip = 
manpage = Input image file to make pyramid from.  If this option is not
entered, the first nonoption argument is taken as the input file.  Either way,
the input file is a required entry.

[Field = RootOutputName]
short = rootname
type = CH
usage = Root name for output files (default is root of input file name)
tooltip = 
manpage = Root name for output files.  If you use the "-subdir" option, this
will also be the basis of the name of the directory in which files are placed.
The default is the root of the input file name.

[Field = ReductionsInSize]
short = reductions
type = IA
usage = List of reduction factors to apply in X and Y (default 2,4,8,...)
tooltip = 
manpage = Comma-separated list of reduction factors to apply in X and Y, such 
as 2,4,8.  The default is a series of powers of 2, with a final factor that
comes closest to reducing the image to 2 megapixels.  The final factor may
substitute for the last power of two if it is close enough.

[Field = ReductionsInZ]
short = zreductions
type = IA
usage = List of reduction factors to apply in Z (default 2,3,4,...)
tooltip = 
manpage = List of reduction factors to apply in Z.  If this option is entered,
there must be the same number of factors as entered with -reductions.  The
default is a series of values increasing by 1 for each volume.

[Field = FilesIntoSubdirectory]
short = subdir
type = B
usage = Place files in a subdirectory named as rootname-pyr
tooltip = 
manpage = Place files in a subdirectory, which will be named as the root name
of the output files with "-pyr" appended.  3dmod(1) can open the files if
given either the name of the image list file inside the subdirectory or the name
of the directory itself. 
If the input file is used as is, the program will attempt to move it into the
subdirectory.

[Field = TiffOutputFiles]
short = tiff
type = B
usage = Output tiled TIFF files instead of montaged MRC files
tooltip = 
manpage = Output tiled TIFF files with Mrc2tif(1) and the -T option.  The default
is to output a montaged MRC stack and piece list file with Reducemont(1).

[Field = TiffCompressionType]
short = compress
type = CH
usage = Compress TIFF files (lzw, zip, jpeg, or numbers defined in libtiff)
tooltip = 
manpage = Apply the given compression to TIFF files.  The allowed entries are
the same as for Mrc2tif(1): "lzw", "zip", "jpeg", or numbers defined in the libtiff
library (these are listed in /usr/include/tiff.h on some Linux systems).  See
the "-c" option of Mrc2tif(1) for details.  If
an invalid number is given, an error will not occur until Mrc2tif(1) is run.

[Field = CompressionQuality]
short = quality
type = I
usage = Quality for JPEG compression (0-100) or for ZIP compression (1-9)
tooltip = 
manpage = Quality for JPEG compression (0-100) or for ZIP compression (1-9)
when writing compressed TIFF files.  See the "-q" option of Mrc2tif(1) for
details.  ZIP compression can give significant size reduction for 16-bit data
that do not fill the 16-bit range, but usually has little value for byte data.
JPEG compression is not available with 16-bit data.

[Field = UseInputFileAsIs]
short = use
type = B
usage = Do not convert the input file to a tiled file
tooltip = 
manpage = Use the input file as it is instead of making a tiled file from it.
You would do this if you want to avoid the storage requirements of having two
copies of the input file.  Access to subareas of this image will be slower
because whole strips have to be loaded, instead of just tiles covering the
desired area.

[Field = AntialiasTypeInXandY]
short = xyanti
type = I
usage = Type of antialias filter to apply in X and Y (0/1 for binning)
tooltip = 
manpage = Type of antialias filter to apply by shrinking the image in X and Y
with Newstack(1).  The filters are:
^    2: Blackman - fast but not as good at antialiasing as slower 
^                  filters
^    3: Triangle - fast but smooths more than Blackman
^    4: Mitchell - good at antialiasing, smooths a bit
^    5: Lanczos 2 lobes - good at antialiasing, less smoothing 
^                  than Mitchell
^    6: Lanczos 3 lobes - slower, even less smoothing but more 
^                  risk of ringing
^ The default here is 6.  Enter 0 or 1 to use ordinary binning in
Binvol(1) instead.

[Field = AntialiasTypeInZ]
short = zanti
type = I
usage = Type of antialias filter to apply in Z (0/1 for binning)
tooltip = 
manpage = Type of antialias filter to apply when reducing in Z with Binvol(1).
The filters are as above, 0 or 1 give ordinary binning, and the default is 6.
With antialias filtering, the "-spread" option to Binvol(1) will be used to
get first and last slices as close to the ends of the data set as possible.

[Field = TileSizeInXandY]
short = tile
type = IP
usage = Approximate size of tiles to create in X and Y (default 1024,1024)
tooltip = 
manpage = Approximate size of tiles to create in X and Y.  This entry is
treated as a maximum size by Reducemont(1), whereas Mrc2tif(1) will adjust the
tile size to be above or below this to minimize wasted storage space.  The
default is 1024,1024.
