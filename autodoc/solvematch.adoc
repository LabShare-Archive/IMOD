series.

type = LI
usage = List of points in series 2 that correspond to list entered for
series 1
tooltip = Enter the list of fiducials in B that correspond to the ones in the

type = FP
usage = X axis tilt used in generating the first and second tomograms

short = angles
type = FP
usage = Tilt angle offsets used in generating the first and second tomograms

[Field = SurfacesOrUseModels]
short = surfaces
type = I
usage = 0 to use matching models and fiducials if any, 2 for fiducials on both
surfaces, 1 or -1 for fiducials on one surface (-1 if tomograms inverted), or
-2 to use matching models only
tooltip =
manpage = This entry governs the mode of operation of the program.  To obtain
the transformation from fiducial points only, enter:
^  2 if there are fiducials on two surfaces, 
^  1 if fiducials are on one surface and the tomograms are NOT
inverted relative to each other,
^ -1 if the tomograms are inverted and there
are fiducials on only one surface,
^  0 to use model files of
corresponding points; with this entry both the matching model points and
fiducial points will be used if the fiducials are available.  
^ -2 to use
only the matching model points and ignore any entries of fiducial point files.
^The default is 2.

enum.-2.tooltip = Select this option to use ONLY models of corresponding points
to find the transformation between tomograms.
enum.-1.tooltip = Select this option when the fiducials lie on one surface and
the top of one tomogram in Z corresponds to the bottom of the other.
enum.0.tooltip = Select this option to use both fiducials and models of
corresponding points to find the transformation between tomograms.
enum.1.tooltip = Select this option when the fiducials lie on one surface and
the tomograms are not inverted in Z with respect to each other.

usage = Largest maximum residual that will allow normal completion of program
tooltip = Maximum residual allowed when fitting a 3D transformation to the
corresponding points.

exit with an error if this value is exceeded.

[Field = LocalFitting]
short = local
type = I
usage =  Minimum # of points for local fitting (default is 0 for no local fits)
tooltip =
manpage = Minimum number of points required in each local area if local fitting
is desired.  The default is 0, which disables local fits.  Non-zero values
must be at least 6.

[Field = CenterShiftLimit]
short = center
type = F
usage =  Maximum shift between central local fit and global fit (default 10)
tooltip =
manpage = Maximum shift between central local fit and global fit.  This shift 
is computed and tested against this limit only when local fitting occurs,
namely when the -local option is selected and the global maximum residual is
greater than the -maxresid entry.  If the shift is greater than the limit,
the program will exit with an
error, but if the solution is adequate there is no need to rerun the program.
The default value is 10.  A value of 0 disables the test.

usage = Amounts to scale fiducial coordinates to match first and second 
tomograms

the coordinates of the first and second tomograms, respectively.  Each factor
should be the binning of the images on which the fiducials were modeled divided
by the binning of the aligned stack.  The entry should not be needed in
ordinary circumstances.  It overrides the scaling that is computed from a
pixel size in the fiducial file and the pixel spacing from the tomogram
header.  The entry can be used as a substitute for providing the image file
name in the -atomogram and -btomogram options.
