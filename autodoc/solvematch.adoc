manpage = A list of the points in series 1 for which a corresponding point in
series 2 is known with confidence.  Ranges may be entered
(e.g. 1-5,7,6,12).  The default is that all points correspond between the two
series.


[Field = BCorrespondenceList]
short = blist
type = LI
usage = List of points in series 2 that correspond to list entered for
series 1
tooltip = Enter the list of fiducials in B that correspond to the ones in the
list entered for A.  Use the point number in *fid.xyz, not the contour number.
manpage =   A list of the corresponding points in the second series.  The same
number of values must be entered in this list as in the preceding
list.  Again, the default is that all points correspond between the
two series.

manpage = Name of fiducial model file for second tilt series.  This entry
is needed only when a transfer coordinate file is being used.

[Field = UsePoints]
short = use
type = LI
usage = List of starting points to use from the A axis (first series taken)
tooltip =
manpage = List of starting points to use from the A axis (the first series 
taken).  The program will start with these correspondences and add other
pairs of points that appear to correspond.

[Field = MatchingAtoB]
short = atob
type = B
usage = The first series here is B and the second series is A
tooltip =
manpage = The first series here (referred to as A in these options) is the B
axis, i.e. the second tilt series taken, and the second series is the A axis.

[Field = XAxisTilts]
short = xtilts
type = FP
usage = X axis tilt used in generating the first and second tomograms
tooltip =
manpage = The values of X axis tilt that were used in generating the first and
second tomograms.  These angles are needed to make the fiducial
coordinates from TILTALIGN correspond to the actual positions of
the particles in the tomograms.  The default values are 0.

[Field = SurfacesOrUseModels]
short = surfaces
type = I
usage = 0 to use matching models and fiducials if any, 2 for fiducials on both
surfaces, 1 or -1 for fiducials on one surface (-1 if tomograms inverted), or
-2 to use matching models only
tooltip =
manpage = This entry governs the mode of operation of the program.  To obtain
the transformation from fiducial points only, enter:
^  2 if there are fiducials on two surfaces, 
^  1 if fiducials are on one surface and the tomograms are NOT
inverted relative to each other,
^ -1 if the tomograms are inverted and there
are fiducials on only one surface,
^  0 to use model files of
corresponding points; with this entry both the matching model points and
fiducial points will be used if the fiducials are available.  
^ -2 to use
only the matching model points and ignore any entries of fiducial point files.
^The default is 2.

enum.-2.tooltip = Select this option to use ONLY models of corresponding points
to find the transformation between tomograms.
enum.-1.tooltip = Select this option when the fiducials lie on one surface and
the top of one tomogram in Z corresponds to the bottom of the other.
enum.0.tooltip = Select this option to use both fiducials and models of
corresponding points to find the transformation between tomograms.
enum.1.tooltip = Select this option when the fiducials lie on one surface and
the tomograms are not inverted in Z with respect to each other.
enum.2.tooltip = Select this option when there are fiducials distributed in Z.

[Field = MaximumResidual]
short = maxresid
type = F
usage = Largest maximum residual that will allow normal completion of program
tooltip = "Maximum residual allowed when fitting a 3D transformation to the
corresponding points.
manpage = The limiting value for the maximum residual, so that the program will
exit with an error if this value is exceeded.


[Field = AMatchingModel]
short = amatch
type = FN
usage =  Model of points from the first tomogram
tooltip =
manpage = Name of model of points from the first tomogram

type = FP
usage = Amounts to scale fiducial coordinates to match first and second 
tomograms
tooltip =
manpage = Amounts by which the fiducial coordinates need to be scaled to match
the coordinates of the first and second tomograms, respectively.  Each factor
should be the binning of the images on which the fiducials were modeled divided
by the binning of the aligned stack.  The entry should not be needed in
ordinary circumstances.  It overrides the scaling that is computed from a
pixel size in the fiducial file and the pixel spacing from the tomogram
header.  The entry can be used as a substitute for providing the image file
name in the -atomogram and -btomogram options.

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip =
