[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
long = OutputFile
type = FN
usage = Output file for 3D transformation (optional)
tooltip = 
manpage = Output file for 3D transformation.  This entry may be omitted.

[Field = AFiducialFile]
short = afiducials
long = AFiducialFile
type = FN
usage =  File with coordinates of fiducials from first tilt series
tooltip =
manpage = Name of file with coordinates of fiducials from the first tilt
series.  To solve for the
transformation using matching models only, omit this entry.

[Field = BFiducialFile]
short = bfiducials
long = BFiducialFile
type = FN
usage = File with coordinates of fiducials from second tilt series
tooltip =
manpage = Name of file with coordinates of fiducials from the second tilt
series.  This entry is not needed when using matching models only.

[Field = ACorrespondenceList]
short = alist
long = ACorrespondenceList
type = LI
usage = List of points in series 1 which have corresponding points in series 2
tooltip =
manpage = A list of the points in series 1 for which a corresponding point in
series 2 is known with confidence.  Ranges may be entered
(e.g. 1-5,7,6,12).  The default is that all points correspond between the two
series.


[Field = BCorrespondenceList]
short = blist
long = BCorrespondenceList
type = LI
usage = List of points in series 2 that correspond to list entered for
series 1
tooltip =
manpage =   A list of the corresponding points in the second series.  The same
number of values must be entered in this list as in the preceding
list.  Again, the default is that all points correspond between the
two series.

[Field = XAxisTilts]
short = xtilts
long = XAxisTilts
type = FP
usage = X axis tilt used in generating the first and second tomograms
tooltip =
manpage = The values of X axis tilt that were used in generating the first and
second tomograms.  These angles are needed to make the fiducial
coordinates from TILTALIGN correspond to the actual positions of
the particles in the tomograms.  The default values are 0.

[Field = SurfacesOrUseModels]
short = surfaces
long = SurfacesOrUseModels
type = I
usage = 0 to use matching models and fiducials if any, 2 for fiducials on both
surfaces, 1 or -1 for fiducials on one surface (-1 if tomograms inverted), or
-2 to use matching models only
tooltip =
manpage = This entry governs the mode of operation of the program.  To obtain
the transformation from fiducial points only, enter 2 if there are fiducials
on two surfaces, 1 if fiducials are on one surface and the tomograms are NOT
inverted relative to each other, or -1 if the tomograms are inverted and there
are fiducials on only one surface.  Enter 0 to use model files of
corresponding points; with this entry both the matching model points and
fiducial points will be used if the fiducials are available.  Enter -2 to use
only the matching model points and ignore any entries of fiducial point files.
The default is 2.

[Field = MaximumResidual]
short = maxresid
long = MaximumResidual
type = F
usage = Largest maximum residual that will allow normal completion of program
tooltip =
manpage = The limiting value for the maximum residual, so that the program will
exit with an error if this value is exceeded.


[Field = AMatchingModel]
short = amatch
long = AMatchingModel
type = FN
usage =  Model of points from the first tomogram
tooltip =
manpage = Name of model of points from the first tomogram

[Field = BMatchingModel]
short = bmatch
long = BMatchingModel
type = FN
usage =  Model of corresponding points from the second tomogram
tooltip =
manpage = Name of model of corresponding points from the second tomogram

[Field = ATomogramOrSizeXYZ]
short = atomogram
long = ATomogramOrSizeXYZ
type = CH
usage = File name or X, Y and Z size of the first tomogram
tooltip =
manpage = Either the file name or the X, Y and Z dimensions of the first
tomogram.

[Field = BTomogramOrSizeXYZ]
short = btomogram
long = BTomogramOrSizeXYZ
type = CH
usage = File name or X, Y and Z size of the second tomogram
tooltip =
manpage = Either the file name or the X, Y and Z dimensions of the second
tomogram.

[Field = ScaleFactors]
short = scales
long = ScaleFactors
type = FP
usage = Amounts to scale fiducial coordinates to match first and second 
tomograms
tooltip =
manpage = Amounts by which the fiducial coordinates need to be scaled to match
the coordinates of the first and second tomograms, respectively.  Each factor
should be the binning of the images on which the fiducials were modeled divided
by the binning of the aligned stack.  The entry should not be needed in
ordinary circumstances.  It overrides the scaling that is computed from a
pixel size in the fiducial file and the pixel spacing from the tomogram
header.  The entry can be used as a substitute for providing the image file
name in the -atomogram and -btomogram options.

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
long = ParameterFile
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.

[Field = usage]
short = help
long = usage
type = B
usage = Print help output
