[Field = InputImageFile]
type = FN
usage = Input file with images to align
tooltip =
manpage = 

[Field = OutputTransformFile]
type = FN
usage = Output file for transforms
tooltip =
manpage = 

[Field = SizeToAnalyze]
short = size
type = IP
usage = Size of image area to analyze in X and Y
tooltip =
manpage = Size of image area to analyze in X and Y.  The default is to analyze
the whole image, ignoring the amount around the edges specified by the -matt
option.

[Field = OffsetToSubarea]
short = offset
type = IP
usage = Offset to center of subarea being analyzed
tooltip =
manpage = When analyzing a subarea, this entry specifies the offfset
to the center of subarea being analyzed in X and Y.  Positive
offsets are used for an area up from and to the right of the center.

[Field = EdgeToIgnore]
short = matt
type = F
usage = Fraction of image to omit at edges, or # of pixels (default 0.05)
tooltip =
manpage = In Xfsimplex, omit areas of images near their edges.  Enter a
value < 1 to indicate the fraction of the image extent to omit, or > 1 to indicate
the number of pixels to omit.  
If a subarea is being analyzed, this amount is ignored inside the subarea and
the fraction is relative to the subarea size. The default is 0.05.

[Field = ReduceByBinning]
short = reduce
type = I
usage = Binning factor to reduce by (default 2)
tooltip = Binning factor to reduce by (default 2).  Image reduction is done
with antialias filtering.
manpage = Factor to reduce images by.  Image reduction is done with antialias
filtering.  The default is 2.

[Field = FilterParameters]
short = filter
type = FA
usage = Sigma1, sigma2, radius1, and radius2 for prefilter
tooltip =
manpage = Filter images before searching with the given sigma1, sigma2,
radius1, and radius2 values, which have the same meaning as in many other
programs.  See Xfsimplex(1) for description.

[Field = SobelFilter]
short = sobel
type = B
usage = Apply edge-detecting Sobel filter to images
tooltip = 
manpage = Apply edge-detecting Sobel filter to each image.  This filter will
be applied after binning and filtering if any.

[Field = ParametersToSearch]
short = params
type = I
usage = 0 for formal params, # of semi-natural params, or -1 to skip search
tooltip =
manpage = In Xfsimplex, search for the given number of semi-natural parameters
or skip the search entirely.
Enter 2 to search only for translations, 3 to search for rotations in
addition, 4 to search for magnifications as well, or 6 to search for the
full transformation as represented by semi-natural parameters (rotation,
magnification, difference between X and Y axis stretch, difference between
X and Y axis rotation.)  
The default is 0, in which case Xfsimplex searches
for the transformation by varying the formal parameters of the 2 by 2
transformation matrix.  The one advantage of using 6 instead of 0 is that the
search can be limited, and the amount of stretch is limited by default.  Enter
-1 to skip the search and perform only initial cross-correlation alignment
(the -prexcorr option must also be entered in this case).

[Field = LimitsOnSearch]
short = limits
type = FA
usage = Limits for each of the variables being searched
tooltip = 
manpage = Limits for each of the variables being searched.  Each number
entered specifies the maximum amount that the respective variable can change
from its initial value.  Enter a 0 to avoid limiting a parameter.  If the
search is being done on formal parameters, then only the first two (shift in X
and Y) can be limited, so only 1 or 2 values will be meaningful.  If the search is
on semi-natural parameters, then you can enter more or fewer values than the
number of variables being searched.  Extra values are ignored, missing values
retain their default values.  The default is 0,0,0,0,0.1,4; i.e., difference
between X and Y axis stretch is limited to 10% and difference between X and Y
axis rotation is limited to 4 degrees.

[Field = BilinearInterpolation]
short = bilinear
type = B
usage = Use linear instead of nearest neighbor interpolation
tooltip =
manpage = With this option, Xfsimplex will use bilinear rather than nearest neighbor
interpolation when transforming an image.  This slower option should be
used when trying to find accurate alignments between small images.

[Field = CorrelationCoefficient]
short = ccc
type = B
usage = Compute correlation coefficient instead of image difference
tooltip = 
manpage = Compute the standard cross-correlation coefficient instead of
difference between images.  The difference measure that is minimized will
be 1 minus the CCC, but the CCC itself is printed in the trace and final 
output.  It takes < 5% more time to compute the CCC.

[Field = LocalPatchSize]
short = local
type = I
usage = Size of square subareas within which to compute SD of difference or CCC
tooltip = 
manpage = Size of square subareas (patches) within which to compute a measure
of image difference, in pixels before binning, if any.  This option should
prevent the need for low frequency filtering, which would increase execution
time by roughly 10%.  Patch sizes on the order of 1/20 to 1/10 of the image
size should be effective.  see Xfsimplex(1) for more details.

[Field = ReferenceFile]
short = reference
type = FN
usage = Image file to align whole image stack to
tooltip =
manpage = Align each image in the input image stack to the single image in the given
image file.  Images can be skipped.

[Field = PreCrossCorrelation]
short = prexcorr
type = B
usage = Do initial alignment by cross-correlation
tooltip =
manpage = Find preliminary translational alignments with tiltxcorr(1).  This
option is not available with a reference file.

[Field = XcorrFilter]
short = xcfilter
type = FA
usage = Sigmas and radii for filter used in initial cross-correlation
tooltip =
manpage = Change the filter that is used in cross-correlation by tiltxcorr(1) to
have the given sigma1, sigma2, radius1, radius2.  The default is 0.01,0.05,0,0.25.

[Field = InitialTransforms]
short = initial
type = FN
usage = Start with initial F transformations from this file
tooltip =
manpage = Search for transformations starting from the transforms in the given
existing file.

[Field = WarpPatchSizeXandY]
short = warp
type = IP
usage = Find warping transformations with the given patch size in X and Y
tooltip =
manpage = Find warping transformations with the given patch size in X and Y.
Before Tiltxcorr(1) is run to find warping, shifts will be determined with 
cross-correlation if the -prexcorr option
is given, and linear transformations will be sought unless "-param -1" is
entered.  Alignment to a reference is not allowed when finding warping
transforms.

[Field = BoundaryModel]
short = boundary
type = FN
usage = Model with contours around areas to analyze for warping
tooltip =
manpage = Model with contours around areas to analyze for warping.  Patches
for warping will be included if their centers fall within one of the
contours.  Contours can be drawn on multiple sections if the area changes
through the stack.  When there is no contour on a section, the contour(s) from
the nearest section with contours will be used to constrain patches.

[Field = ShiftLimitsForWarp]
short = shift
type = IP
usage = Limits in X and Y for shifts when using patch correlation to find warping
tooltip =
manpage = Limits in X and Y for shifts when using patch correlation to find
warping.  The highest cross-correlation peak will be used that falls within
the limits, or a zero shift will be assigned if none does.

[Field = SkipSections]
short = skip
type = LI
usage = List of sections to skip, aligning across skipped sections (ranges OK)
tooltip =
manpage = List of sections to skip, while maintaining alignment across skipped
sections.  The program will not find the transform for aligning a listed section to
the previous one.  Section numbers are separated by the ',' character
for single sections or the '-' character for ranges.
Section numbers start with zero and go up to nz-1.  When a section is skipped,
the following section will be aligned to the last unskipped section and a unit
transform will be output for the skipped section.
The default is to use all of the sections.

[Field = BreakAtSections]
short = break
type = LI
usage = List of sections to break alignment at (ranges OK)
tooltip =
manpage = List of sections to break alignment at.  This option is like
"-skip"
in that no transform is found for aligning a listed section to
the previous one and a unit transform is written for the listed section.
However, the following section will be aligned to the
listed section, and nothing will be aligned to the previous section.  This
breaks the chain of alignment through the series of sections.

[Field = PairedImages]
short = bpair
type = B
usage = Break alignment for paired images
tooltip =
manpage = Break the alignment after every pair of sections, i.e., at all even
section numbers.

[Field = TomogramAverages]
short = tomo
type = B
usage = Align top/bottom averages from serial tomograms
tooltip =
manpage = Align averaged slices from the top and bottom of tomograms of serial
sections. The image file is assumed to contain pairs of top and bottom
averages, i.e., from the top of the first tomogram, the bottom of the second,
the top of the second, etc., ending in the bottom of the last tomogram.  The
program will align only a bottom average to the previous top average, and the
number of transforms output will equal the number of tomograms, not the number
of averages in the image file.  The same number of transforms are assumed to
be present in a file of initial alignments entered with the "-initial" option.

[Field = DifferenceOutput]
short = diff
type = B
usage = Output final difference measure or correlation coefficient for each pair
tooltip =
manpage = Output the final difference measure or cross-correlation coefficient
found by Xfsimplex for each pair of images.
The difference measure is the mean difference per pixel expressed as a multiple of the
image standard deviation.

[Field = SectionsNumberedFromOne]
short = one
type = B
usage = Section number entries are numbered from 1 instead of from 0
tooltip =
manpage = Section numbers in the -skip and -break section list entries are
numbered from 1 instead of from 0.

[Field = PID]
type = B
usage = Print process ID
tooltip =
manpage =
