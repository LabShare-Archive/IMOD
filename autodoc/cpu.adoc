# The cpu.adoc file contains descriptions of the computers you wish to use when
# running parallel processes with processchunks through eTomo.  The file is
# placed in the IMOD calibration directory (defined by $IMOD_CALIB_DIR, default
# location /usr/local/ImodCalib).  Run "man cpuadoc" for complete details on
# the entries to a cpu.adoc file.  This file shows a number of examples.
