# Descriptions of computers and CPUs to use in Etomo parallel processing
# This file should be placed in the calibration directory (env|grep IMOD_CALIB_DIR)

# Optional cpu.adoc attributes (can be placed in any order):
# units.speed:  Column subheader for processor speed
# units.memory:  Column subheader for amount of RAM
# max.tilt:  Maximum number of CPUs recommended for running processchunks tilt
# max.volcombine:  Maximum number of CPUs recommended for running processchunks volcombine

# Computer names should be placed in brackets [Computer = name]

# Computer attributes (can be placed in any order):

# number:  number of CPUs (defaults to 1)
# Required on a multi-processor system

# For a standalone two-processor system, all that is needed is:
# [Computer = localhost]
# number = 2

# Optional computer attributes:
# type:  cpu type
# speed:  processor speed
# memory:  amount of RAM
# os:  operating system

# If an attribute is never used, the corresponding column will be omitted from
# parallel processing table in eTomo.
