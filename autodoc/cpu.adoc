# The cpu.adoc file contains descriptions of the computers you wish to use when
# running parallel processes with processchunks.  It affects the parallel
# processing table in Etomo and is used to run processchunks.  The cpu.adoc file
# must be placed in the calibration directory.  Change directory to
# $IMOD_CALIB_DIR to see the calibration directory.

# See below for definitions of the elements contained in a cpu.adoc file and
# many examples.

#
#
# DEFINITIONS
#
#

#
# Computer Sections:
#

# Each section describes one computer.  A section must have the following syntax:
# [Computer = {computer name}].  The computer name will be used by Etomo and IMOD
# to contact the computer.

#
# Computer Attributes:
#

# Computer attributes are name/value pairs found under a computer section, they
# have the following syntax:  name = value.  The order of the attributes in not
# important.

# The number attribute:
# number = {number of cpus}
# The number attribute is necessary if you have a computer with multiple
# processors.  If you don't use this attribute, a single processor is assumed.

# The optional attributes:
# The other attributes are descriptive and completely optional.  Since the these
# attributes are just descriptive, you can put anything in them that you want.
# However, any attribute you do not use will be omitted from the table, so not
# using attributes can save screen space in Etomo.  If all of the users are
# familiar with the attributes of the computers or you are planning to use all
# of the computers every time you run a parallel process, then you don't really
# need to use anything but the number attribute.  

# Optional attributes details:

# type = {CPU type}
# This attribute goes into the table under the heading "CPU Type" and can
# contain a description of the computer's processor.

# speed = {CPU speed}
# This attribute goes into the table under the heading "Speed" and can contain
# the speed of the computer.  If you want to put units for this attribute in the
# column header, see the Global Attributes section below.

# memory = {the amount of RAM}
# This attribute goes into the table under the heading "RAM" and can contain the
# amount of memory the computer has.  If you want to put units for this
# attribute in the column header, see the Global Attributes section below.

# os = {operating system}
# This attribute goes into the table under the heading "OS" and can contain a
# description of the operating system the computer is using.

#
# Global Attributes:
#

# Global attributes are name/value pairs found at the top of the file, they
# have the following syntax:  nameA.nameB = value.  The order of the attributes
# is not important.

# Version = 1.0
# The Version attribute is required.  It refers to the syntax used in .adoc
# files and should always be set to 1.0.

# Optional global attributes:

# units.speed = {the units for the speed attributes}
# The value appears in sub-heading row in the Etomo parallel processing table
# under the heading "Speed".

# units.memory = {the units for the memory attributes}
# The value appears in sub-heading row in the Etomo parallel processing table
# under the heading "RAM".

# max.tilt = {the maximum number of CPUs users should use for tilt}
# When this attribute is in use, a reminder not to use too many CPUs will appear
# next to the tilt parallel processing checkbox.  This number must be a whole
# number.  The purpose of this attribute is to both prevent users from using too
# many CPUs and to prevent them from experiencing diminishing returns because
# of bottlenecks.  We are currently setting max.tilt to 12, but your mileage
# will vary.

# max.volcombine = {the maximum number of CPUs users should use for volcombine}
# See max.tilt.  We are currently setting max.volcombine to 8.

#
# Limitations:
#
 
# Windows computers cannot be placed in a cpu.adoc parallel processing table
# with Linux and Macintosh computers.

# All computers in the cpu.adoc will be loaded into a scrollable table in Etomo.
# A cpu.adoc with hundreds of computers may slow down Etomo too much.

# EXAMPLES

# An example of cpu.adoc for a standalone two-processor system:
#

[Computer = localhost]

#
# An example of cpu.adoc for 4 computers with the same operating system and type
# of processor:
#

Version = 1.0
units.speed = GHz
units.memory = GB

[Computer = frodo]
number = 2
speed = 2.3
memory = 5.0

# If the resulting table in Etomo is too wide, the cpu.adoc can be changed to
# this:
