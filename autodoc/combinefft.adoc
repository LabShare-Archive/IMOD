[Field = AInputFFT]
short = ainput
type = FN
usage = Input file from first tomogram (the one being matched to)
tooltip =
manpage = Input file from the first tomogram (the one being matched to):
either the FFT of a chunk from the tomogram, or the tomogram itself, from
which a chunk can be extracted with the 'MinAndMax' options

[Field = BInputFFT]
short = binput
type = FN
usage = Input file from second tomogram (the transformed one)
tooltip =
manpage = Input file from the second tomogram (the transformed one):
either the FFT of a chunk from the tomogram, or the tomogram itself, from
which a chunk can be extracted with the 'MinAndMax' options

[Field = OutputFFT]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output file for combined data (omit to rewrite second input FFT file)
tooltip =
manpage = Output file for the combined FFTs or real-space volumes.  An output
file must be entered with real-space input, but the file can be omitted for
FFT input, in which case the program will write the combined FFT back to the
second input file.

[Field = XMinAndMax]
short = xminmax
type = IP
usage = Starting & ending X coordinates to extract from tomogram, numbered
from 0
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending X index coordinates to extract from the
tomograms, numbered from 0.  The default is the whole width in X.

[Field = YMinAndMax]
short = yminmax
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending Y coordinates to extract, numbered from 0
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending Y index coordinates to extract from the
tomograms, numbered from 0.  The default is the whole height in Y.

[Field = ZMinAndMax]
short = zminmax
type = IP
usage = Starting and ending Z coordinates to extract, numbered from 0
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending Z index coordinates to extract from the
tomograms, numbered from 0.  The default is the whole depth in Z.

type = IT
usage = Number of pixels over which to taper the patches in X, Y and Z
tooltip = 
manpage = Number of pixels over which to taper and pad the patches in X, Y and
Z.  The default is 0.  The amount of tapering in any dimension may be
increased to make that dimension suitable for taking an FFT.

[Field = ATiltFile]
short = atiltfile
type = FN
usage = File with tilt angles used to generate first tomogram
tooltip = 
manpage = File with tilt angles used to generate first tomogram.  The file
should have one tilt angle per line.  The first and last line in the file
are assumed to have the starting and ending tilt angles.

[Field = BTiltFile]
short = btiltfile
type = FN
usage = File with tilt angles used to generate second tomogram
tooltip = 
manpage = File with tilt angles used to generate second tomogram, in the
same format as for ATiltFile.

[Field = AHighestTilts]
short = ahighest
type = FP
usage = Starting and ending tilt angles used to generate first tomogram
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending tilt angles used to generate first tomogram.
This entry and ATiltFile are mutually exclusive.

[Field = BHighestTilts]
short = bhighest
type = FP
usage = Starting and ending tilt angles used to generate second tomogram
tooltip = 
manpage = Starting and ending tilt angles used to generate second tomogram.
This entry and BTiltFile are mutually exclusive.

[Field = InverseTransformFile]
short = inverse
type = FN
usage = File with inverse of matching transformation (output by Matchvol)
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of file with inverse of transformation used to match the two
tomograms (output by Matchvol).  This entry is required.

[Field = ReductionFraction]
short = reduce
type = F
usage = Reduce amplitudes in missing wedge regions by this fraction of the
amount needed to match mixed data regions (default 0 for no 
reduction).
tooltip =
manpage = This option can be used to reduce the amplitudes in regions 
where data is taken only from one tomogram (missing wedge regions). 
Mean amplitudes are measured by dividing the volume into a number of slabs in
the Y dimension, then dividing each slab into rings based on radius from the
origin.  Within each ring, the mean is obtained for points in the region where 
data is averaged between the two tomograms (joint data region), and the
regions where data are available only from A or only from B (A-only or B-only
regions).  With a fraction of 1, the values in the A-only region will be
reduced by the ratio of the combined mean to the mean in A-only region, and
similarly for the B-only region.  If the ratio is greater than 1, no reduction
occurs.  A smaller fraction will reduce values by a proportionally smaller
amount.

[Field = SeparateReduction]
short = separate
type = B
usage = Apply different reduction factors to data from A and B in a ring
tooltip =
manpage = With this option, values in regions where data are available only
from A will be reduced by the ratio of the mean combined value in the 
joint data region to the mean value from A in the joint data region, and
similarly for B.

[Field = JointReduction]
short = joint
type = B
usage = Measure means for A and B in joint, not missing wedge, regions
tooltip =
manpage = With this option, for points in the region where data is averaged
between the two tomograms (joint data region), the mean is obtained within
each ring for values from A, values from B, and the combined values.  The
values in missing wedge regions will be reduced by the ratio of the combined
mean to the average of the means from A and B.

[Field = RingWidth]
short = ring
type = F
usage = Width of rings used to reduce amplitudes (default 0.01)
tooltip=
manpage= Width of rings or shells used to reduce amplitudes.  The default is
0.01.

[Field = NumberOfSlabsInY]
short = nslabs
type = I
usage = Number of divisions in Y dimension when reducing amplitudes 
(default 1)
tooltip=
manpage= Number of divisions in Y dimension when reducing amplitudes.  The
default is 1, which will use spherical shells not divided into slabs.  If
this number is increased, the ring width should be increased as well to avoid
dividing the volume into too many regions with too few pixels.

[Field = MinimumRadiusToReduce]
short = radius
type = F
usage = Radius at which to start the first ring when reducing amplitudes
(default 0.02)
tooltip = 
manpage =

[Field = MinimumPointsInRing]
short = points
type = I
usage = Minimum number of points required in each region of a ring for
reducing amplitudes (default 30)
tooltip =
manpage =

[Field = LowFromBothRadius]
short = both
type = F
usage = Radius below which data will always be averaged from both tomograms
tooltip = Frequency below which data will always be averaged from both
tomograms.  A value of 0.01 to 0.015 should be effective in preventing lines
between pieces.
manpage = Radius below which data will always be averaged from both tomograms.
Sometimes a combined tomogram shows lines between the separate pieces that 
were run through Combinefft, particularly for pieces containing a boundary 
between dense material and resin.  This option will eliminate this effect
by ensuring that the low-frequency components match between the combined 
pieces.  A value of 0.01 to 0.015 should be effective.

[Field = VerboseOutput]
short = verbose
type = B
usage = Output amplitudes being attenuated when reducing
tooltip =
manpage = With this option, the program will print the amplitudes and
reduction factors for every region being reduced.  The columns output are:
the ring number; the slab number (slabs are numbered sequentially from 
negative to positive Y); the zone, which is
1 for the region with data from the first tomogram only, and 3 for the region
with data from the second tomogram only; the mean amplitude of the joint data
region; the mean for data relevant to the zone in question; the target value
for the reduction in mean; and the reduction factor.

[Field = WeightingPower]
short = weight
type = F
usage = Weight data from A and B by the local sampling density to this power
(default 0 for no weighting)
tooltip =
manpage = This option allows a weighted combination of values instead of
simple averaging when data are available from both FFTs.
A local sampling density is computed for the
point in each of the FFTs, based upon its radius from the origin and the local 
density of tilted views.  These densities are raised to the given power,
normalized to add to one, and used as weights in combining the two Fourier
values.  Values between 0 and 1 should be tried; 0 gives no weighting.
