will be accepted before phase 1, then the regular sequence of phases will be
followed to reach the target number.

usage = Model containing contours enclosing areas in which to use or exclude beads
tooltip =
manpage = Name of model file whose first object contains contours enclosing
areas in which to use or to exclude beads, depending on whther -exclude is
entered.  If more than one contour is drawn on a view, points inside any one
of the contours will be considered inside the area.  This program will
use only the contours on the view closest to the middle section for tracking.

[Field = ExcludeInsideAreas]
short = exclude
type = B
usage = Use the boundary model to exclude regions from analysis

[Field = TargetNumberOfBeads]
short = number
type = I
usage = Desired total number of beads to choose for output seed model
tooltip =
manpage = Desired total number of beads to choose for output  seed model.  If
beads are on two surfaces, the program will seek to find half the target number
on each surface, then pick more beads on either surface to reach the taget.

type = F
usage = Desired density of beads in final seed model per 1000 square pixels

provides an alternative way of specifying the target that is independent of
data set size.

[Field = LimitMajorityToTarget]
short = nobeef
type = B
usage = Accept no more than half the number of target beads on majority surface
tooltip =
manpage = Do not increase the number of beads on the surface with more beads
to make up for a deficiency on the other surface.  Autofidseed(1) uses this
option to limit the number beads on the majority surface in response to its
-ratio option.

[Field = ClusteredPointsAllowed]
short = cluster
type = I
usage = 1 to include beads near others, 2-4 to include elongated beads also
tooltip =
manpage = This option is used to allow two kinds of less desirable beads to be
included: ones close to other beads, and ones that are elongated or overlap
another bead over most of the views that they are tracked in.  Enter 1 to
include clustered beads. i.e, ones that appear to be located within 2
diameters of other beads, where foreshortening perpendicular to the tilt axis
is taken into account in computing this separation.  Only one of a pair of
clustered points will be accepted.  Enter 2, 3, or 4 to include
beads identified as elongated in up to 1/3, up to 2/3, or all of the beadtrack
runs, respectively.

[Field = LowerTargetForClustered]
short = lower
type = F
usage = Include clustered points only if # of beads is still below this target
tooltip =
manpage = Include clustered and elongated points as allowed by the -cluster
option only when the total number of beads is still below the reduced target
given here.  The value entered should be in the same form as the regular
target was specified, i.e, a number of beads if -number was entered or a bead
density if -density was entered.

[Field = RotationAngle]
short = rotation
type = F
usage = Angle of rotation of the tilt axis in the images

type = FA
usage = Alternative weights for composing a score for each candidate bead
tooltip =
manpage = Alternative weights for composing a score for each candidate bead.
Enter 4 weights: for fraction of points missing in a track; for
fraction of Beadtrack runs from which the point is missing; for mean residual
during bead tracking; and for the mean deviation between the different tracks
of the same bead.  The default weights are all 1.

[Field = ControlValue]

type = FPM
usage = Parameter number and value for setting algorithm control parameters
tooltip =
manpage = Parameter number and value for setting algorithm control parameters.

by their surface.  Available colors in order are green, magenta, yellow, cyan,
red, solid blue, orange, purple, dark blue, salmon, dark red.  One or two
