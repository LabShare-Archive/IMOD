will be accepted before phase 1, then the regular sequence of phases will be
followed to reach the target number.

[Field = BeadSize]

entered or a bead density if -density was entered.

clustered (2.)

integral and replacing measures with the residual of the fit (which does not
help), and 2 for analyzing the elongation measure in successive groups of at
least 50 values, when values are arranged in order by bead integral (which
does not help)
^ 18: Angle to rotate plot of mean of edge SD versus SD of edge SD to obtain
an adjusted edge SD (-59 degrees, the mean from 7 data sets)
^ 19: Angle to rotate plot of mean versus SD of elongation measure to obtain
an adjusted elongation measure (-67 degrees, the mean of 8 data sets)
^ 20: Angle to rotate plot of adjusted elongation measure versus adjusted edge
SD to obtain the final elongation measure to analyze for outliers (45 degrees,
corresponds to simply averaging the two adjusted values)
