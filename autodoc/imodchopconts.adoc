[Field = InputFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input model filename
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of input model file.  If this option is not entered,
the first non-option argument will be taken as the input file.

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output model filename
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of output model file.  If this option is not entered,
the second non-option argument will be taken as the output file.

[Field = LengthAndOverlap]
short = length
type = IP
usage = Number of points and minimum overlap for new contours
tooltip = 
manpage = Number of points (length) and minimum number of overlapping points
for new contours.  If the overlap is 0 or positive, then all new contours will
be given the same number of points, but both the overlap and the number of
contours will vary depending on the length of the original contour.  Enter an
overlap value of -1 to enforce zero overlap between contours and have the
contours broken into variable lengths, typically less than the specified length.

[Field = NumberAndOverlap]
short = number
type = IP
usage = Number of pieces to break longest contours into, and minimum overlap
tooltip = 
manpage = The option provides an alternative way to specify how to chop up
contours.  The maximum number of points in any contour to be processed will be
divided by the given number to determine the number of points to require in
each new contour.

[Field = AssignSurfaces]
short = surfaces
type = B
usage = Give each new contour a surface number equal to old contour number
tooltip = 
manpage = Give each new contour a surface number equal to the number of the
contour from which it came.  This will replace any existing surface numbers
and invalidate any fine-grained information that applies to surfaces.

[Field = ObjectsToDo]
short = objects
type = LI
usage = List of objects to chop up (default is all)
tooltip = 
manpage = List of objects to chop up, a comma-separate list of ranges.  The
default is to chop up all objects.
