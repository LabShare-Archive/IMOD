[Field = InputModel]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input model filename
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of input model file.  If this option is not entered,
the first non-option argument will be taken as the input file.

[Field = OutputModel]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output model filename
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of output model file.  If this option is not entered,
the second non-option argument will be taken as the output file.

[Field = LengthOfPieces]
short = length
type = I
usage = Number of points to put in each new contour
tooltip = 
manpage = The length of the new contours, i.e., the number of points to put in
each.  The actual length can be affected by the entry for \fB-overlap\fR.  If
-1 is entered, the length will be the default for breaking up contours from
patch tracking in eTomo, which is the Z size in the
model divided by 5, but no less than 16.  The default if neither this option
nor \fB-length\fR is entered is to leave contours as they are.

[Field = MinimumOverlap]
short = overlap
type = I
usage = Minimum overlap between pieces, or -1 for 0 overlap
tooltip = 
manpage = The minimum number of points overlapping between pieces.  If the
minimum overlap is 0 or positive, then all new contours will be given the same
number of points, but both the overlap and the number of contours will vary
depending on the length of the original contour.  Enter -1 to enforce zero
overlap between contours and have the contours broken into variable lengths,
typically less than the specified length.  The default is 4, unless 1 is
entered for \fB-length\fR, in which case the default is 0.

[Field = NumberOfPieces]
short = number
type = I
usage = Number of pieces to break longest contours into
tooltip = 
manpage = This option provides an alternative way to specify how to chop up
contours.  The maximum number of points in any contour to be processed will be
divided by the given number to determine the number of points to require in
each new contour.

[Field = AssignSurfaces]
short = surfaces
type = B
usage = Give each new contour a surface number equal to old contour number
tooltip = 
manpage = Give each new contour a surface number equal to the number of the
contour from which it came.  This will replace any existing surface numbers
and invalidate any fine-grained information that applies to surfaces.

[Field = BreakAtColors]
short = colors
type = I
usage = Break contours at color changes into new surfaces (1) or objects (2)
tooltip =
manpage = Break contours at fine-grained color changes, assigning them to new
surfaces or new objects with the appropriate color if 1 or 2 is entered,
respectively.  None of the options related to length-based chopping
(\fB-length\fR, \fB-overlap\fR, \fB-number\fR, or \fB-surfaces\fR) may be
entered with this option.  See above for details.

[Field = ObjectsToDo]
short = objects
type = LI
usage = List of objects to chop up (default is all)
tooltip = 
manpage = List of objects to chop up, a comma-separate list of ranges.  The
default is to chop up all objects.
