[Field = InputFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input image file to rotate
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output file for rotated volume
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = TemporaryDirectory]
short = tempdir
type = CH
usage = Directory to use for temporary files (default is current directory)
tooltip = 
manpage = Directory to use for temporary files.  The default is that the
temporary files will be placed in the current directory.

[Field = OutputSizeXYZ]
short = size
type = IT
usage = X, Y, Z dimensions of the output file (default is size of input file)
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = RotationCenterXYZ]
short = center
type = FT
usage = X, Y, Z index coordinates of the center of rotation (Default is 
center of input file)
tooltip = 
manpage = X, Y, Z index coordinates of the center of the region to be
rotated (Default is 
center of input file).  This location will be placed in the center of the
output volume.  Coordinates are numbered from zero.

[Field = RotationAnglesZYX]
short = angles
type = FT
usage = Angles to rotate about Z, Y, and X axes, in that order (defaults 0)
tooltip = Angles to rotate about Z, Y, and X axes.  Rotations will be
applied in that order; first around Z, then Y, then X.
manpage = 

[Field = InterpolationOrder]
short = order
type = I
usage = Order of interpolation to use (1: linear, 2: quadratic; default is 2)
tooltip = 
manpage = Order of interpolation to use.  Currently only quadratic (2) and
linear (1) interpolation are available; the default is quadratic.

[Field = QuerySizeNeeded]
short = query
type = B
usage = Just return output size needed to contain whole volume
tooltip = 
manpage = With this entry, the program will compute the size of the output
volume needed to contain the whole original volume after rotation.  It will
just print the sizes in X, Y, and Z then exit.

[Field = FillValue]
short = fill
type = F
usage = Value to fill regions without image data (default is file mean)
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = MemoryLimit]
short = memory
type = I
usage = Memory to use for major arrays, in megabytes (default 768)
tooltip = 
manpage = Amount of memory to allocate for the major arrays needed by the
program.  This always includes memory for input images and may include memory
for a stack of output slices, depending on the orientation of the output.

[Field = VerboseOutput]
short = verbose
type = I
usage = 1 for diagnostic output
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.

[Field = usage]
short = help
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip =
