[Field = InputFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input image file with distortion pairs
tooltip = 
manpage = Input image file with distortion pairs.  If this option is not
entered, the first non-option argument will be taken as the input file name.

[Field = OutputRoot]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Root name for output files
tooltip = 
manpage = Root name for output files.  If this option is not entered, the
second non-option argument will be used as the root name.

[Field = PairsToAnalyze]
short = pairs
type = LI
usage = List of images to analyze in pairs (from 0, default is all images)
tooltip = 
manpage = List of images to analyze in pairs; for example 0-7 if sections 0
and 1, 2 and 3, 4 and 5, and 6 and 7 are all image pairs.  The default is to
assume that all images in the file form successive pairs.  Sections are
numbered from 0.

[Field = ImageBinning]
short = binning
type = I
usage = Binning of images on the CCD camera (default 2)
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = FieldSpacing]
short = field
type = I
usage = Pixel spacing for output distortion field (default 40)
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = DataSpacing]
short = data
type = I
usage = Pixel spacing for data used to solve linear equations (default 20)
tooltip = 
manpage = Pixel spacing for data used to solve linear equations for the
distortion field.  This spacing should be about half of the spacing for the
output field.  The default is 20.

[Field = GridSpacing]
short = grid
type = I
usage = Pixel spacing for grid of displacements in overlap zones (default 16)
tooltip = 
manpage = Pixel spacing for grid on which displacements will be measured in
the overlap zones between paired images (default 16).

[Field = BoxSize]
short = box
type = I
usage = Size of box used to measure local displacements (default 24)
tooltip = 
manpage = Size of box used to measure local displacements.  Boxes of this
size will be correlated between the two images at every position on the grid.
The default is 24.  This value should be increased if the solution is noisy.

[Field = GridIndent]
short = indent
type = I
usage = Amount to indent the boxes in the grid of displacements (default 4)
tooltip = 
manpage = Amount to indent the boxes in the grid of displacements from the 
edge of the overlap zone.  The default is 4 pixels; this vakue can be dropped
to 2 for larger than default boxes.

[Field = Iterations]
short = iterations
type = I
usage = Maximum number of iterations when solving equations
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = UseOldTransforms]
short = usexf
type = B
usage = Use existing transforms on first iteration
tooltip = 
manpage = Use existing transforms instead of running Tiltxcorr on the first
iteration; these transforms are stored in the file rootname.rawxf when
Tiltxcorr is run on the first iteration.

[Field = StretchFile]
short = strfile
type = FN
usage = File with transformation aligning 90-degree rotated images
tooltip = 
manpage = File with transformation that aligns two 90-degree rotated images of
the same area.  This transformation is used to determine the absolute stretch
in the distortion field.

[Field = PatchOutput]
short = patch
type = B
usage = Output a patch file to convert to a model with patch2imod
tooltip = 
manpage = Output a patch file to convert to a model with patch2imod.  The
patch file will be named rootname.patch.

[Field = CoverageImage]
short = coverage
type = FN
usage = Name of output file for image of data coverage for vectors
tooltip = 
manpage = Name of file in which to place an image representing the amount of
data available for solving each vector.  This is image is based on the sum of
the coefficients for each distortion vectors, normalized so that the mean sum
will equal the ratio of total measurements to unknowns (rows to columns in the
data matrix).  To get a true representation of the amount of nonredundant
coverage of each field position, use -data to set the data spacing the same as
the field spacing.

[Field = RedirectOutput]
short = redirect
type = CH
usage = String for redirecting output (default "> /dev/null")
tooltip = 
manpage = String for redirecting output from Tiltxcorr and Newstack.  The
default is "> /dev/null", which will not work in Windows.  A valid Windows
path must be entered; "> xcorr.tmp" would work. 

[Field = SolveWithMultr]
short = multr
type = B
usage = Use matrix inversion instead of iterative method
tooltip = 
manpage = Use matrix inversion instead of iterative method to solve
equations.

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.

[Field = usage]
short = help
type = B
usage = Print help output
tooltip = 
manpage = Print help output.
