[Field = InputFile]
short = input
type = FN
usage = Input image file to warp
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = OutputFile]
short = output
type = FN
usage = Output file for warped volume
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = TransformFile]
short = xforms
type = FN
usage = File with inverse transforms used for warping
tooltip = 
manpage = File with matrix of inverse transforms produced by Findwarp

[Field = ScaleTransforms]
short = scale
type = F
usage = Factor by which to scale transforms
tooltip = 
manpage = Factor by which to scale transforms, to account for the input image
file having a different binning or scaling than the file on which transforms
were derived.  For example, if transforms were found on files binned by 2,
enter 2 to apply the transforms to an unbinned file.

[Field = TemporaryDirectory]
short = tempdir
type = CH
usage = Directory to use for temporary files (default is current directory)
tooltip = 
manpage = Directory to use for temporary files.  The default is that the
temporary files will be placed in the current directory.

[Field = OutputSizeXYZ]
short = size
type = IT
usage = X, Y, Z dimensions of the output file (Default is Z, Y, X size of
input file)
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = SameSizeAsInput]
short = same
type = B
usage = Make default size of output file be same size as input file
tooltip = 
manpage = Make default size of output file be same size as input file.  One or
more of the dimensions can be overridden by a value in a -size entry.

[Field = InterpolationOrder]
short = order
type = I
usage = Order of interpolation to use (1 = linear, 2 = quadratic; default = 2)
tooltip = 
manpage = Order of interpolation to use.  Currently only quadratic (2) and
linear (1) interpolation are available; the default is quadratic.

[Field = MemoryLimit]
short = memory
type = I
usage = Memory to use for major arrays, in megabytes (default 768)
tooltip = 
manpage = Amount of memory to allocate for the major arrays needed by the
program, in megabytes.  This always includes memory for input images and may
include memory for a plane of transformations or for a stack of output slices,
depending on whether transformations rotate the data by 90 degrees.  The
default is 768.

[Field = VerboseOutput]
short = verbose
type = I
usage = 1 for diagnostic output; 2 for output as each slice is loaded
tooltip = 
manpage = 

[Field = PatchOutputFile]
short = patch
type = FN
usage = Output text file for patch vectors at each transform
tooltip = 
manpage = Output text file for vectors representing the displacement produced
by each transform.  It can be converted to a model with patch2imod(1).
The program will exit without making an output file if this option is given.

[Field = FilledInOutputFile]
short = filled
type = FN
usage = Output file for warping transforms after filling in empty positions
tooltip = 
manpage = Output file for warping transforms after filling in empty positions.
The program will exit without making an output image file if this option is given.

[Field = ParameterFile]
short = param
type = PF
usage = Read parameter entries from file
tooltip = 
manpage = Read parameter entries as keyword-value pairs from a parameter file.

[Field = usage]
short = help
type = B
usage = Print help output
