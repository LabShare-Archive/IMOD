####CreatedVersion#### 3.7.2
#
#   To run in trial mode where it will not replace pixels or produce an output
#   file, include a line with the entry "TrialMode"
#
#   To run with a model specifying points to replace, add a line like:
# ModelFile  g5a.erase
#    and specify objects to replace on all sections with
# AllSectionObjects  <list of objects>
#   and indicate objects that specify lines with
# LineObjects <list of objects>
