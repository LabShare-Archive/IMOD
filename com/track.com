0	initial angle of rotation as in TILTALIGN
0	# sets of reshoots: list reshoots on following line(s) as in TILTALIGN
1	-1 to enter all tilts, 1 to specify starting & increment, 0 read file
-60,1.5	start and increment if 1
7,0	grouping for tilt variables
5,0	grouping for mag variables
4	minimum views for doing tilt alignment (make bigger if 1 deg tilts?)
