 * <p> $Log$
 * <p> Revision 1.6  2007/09/10 20:33:10  sueh
 * <p> bug# 925 Removed lazy initialization for ProcessResultDisplay so initialized is
 * <p> no longer needed.
 * <p>
 * <p> Revision 1.5  2006/07/26 16:36:45  sueh
 * <p> bug# 868 Added msg(ProcessResult)
 * <p>
 * <p> Revision 1.4  2006/02/06 21:16:17  sueh
 * <p> bug# 521 Changed following display to dependent display.  Added
 * <p> dependecy index and initialized.
 * <p>
 * <p> Revision 1.3  2006/01/31 20:50:37  sueh
 * <p> bug# 521 Added failureDisplayList, successDisplayList, and
 * <p> followingDisplayList to change the state of other displays when the
 * <p> process associated with the current instance succeeds or fails.
 * <p> Added BaseScreenState so that buttons on dialogs not current
 * <p> displayed could change their state.  Without the ability to change the
 * <p> screen state setting, they're old state would be reloaded when the
 * <p> dialog was redisplayed.
 * <p>
 * <p> Revision 1.2  2006/01/26 21:58:58  sueh
 * <p> bug# 401 Turn this class into an interface.  Place the functionality into
 * <p> ProcessResultDisplayState.  This allows a greater variety of classes to be
 * <p> ProcessResultDisplay's.
 * <p>
 * <p> Revision 1.1  2006/01/20 21:02:00  sueh
 * <p> bug# 401 A class which manipulates the state of its child based on the
 * <p> result of a process.
 * <p> </p>
