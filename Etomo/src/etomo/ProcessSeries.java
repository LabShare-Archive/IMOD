/**
 * <p>Description: Represents a series of processes to be executed.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This was originally done in BaseManager with a nextProcess string and a
 * lastProcess string.  The problem with this method is that a button press that
 * triggers axis-is-busy functionality could cause the process series to change
 * before the axis is checked.  This became clear when the run3dmodProcess
 * was added.  So we need to create a new process series when each series of
 * processes is run.</p>
 * 
 * <p>A ProcessSeries instance is created in the function that first decides to
 * set up a process series.  Next, last and/or 3dmod process(es) can be added at
 * any time and it is not necessary for any process function to know whether it
 * is the first process in the series.  This is handled by only constructing a
 * processSeries when it is null and will be added to.  3dmod processes, which
 * are added blindly (without checking if they are null), will only be set to
 * ProcessSeries.run3dmodButton if they are not null.</P>
 * 
 * <P>The ProcessSeries instance is passed as a constant to the run process
 * function in the process manager.  It goes into the process object and
 * eventually gets to a processDone function, where
 * ProcessSeries.startNextProcess() is called.  If nextProcess or lastProcess is
 * set, ProcessSeries.startNextProcess calls the manager startNextProcess and
 * passes it a reference to the instance of ProcessSeries.  The manager
 * startNextProcess starts the next process, passing the processSeries instance.
 * ProcessSeries should be passed to process functions whether or not a process
 * series is being started or added to.  This means that you do not have to keep
 * track of when it is in use.</P>
 * 
 * <P>If nextProcess and lastProcess are both empty (they are cleared when their
 * process is run), then run3dmodButton is checked.  If it is set, then it is
 * used to run a 3dmod process.  ProcessSeries.run3dmodButton is a
 * Run3dmodButton whose main function is to run a 3dmod immediately (not
 * deferred).  It was added to a deferred Run3dmodButton whose main function is
 * to run the first process in the process series.  ProcessSeries.run3dmodButton
 * still has a reference to the dialog it was last placed on (its container), so
 * its action function, which is called with ProcessSeries.run3dmodMenuOptions,
 * will call the dialog's action function.</P>
 * 
 * <P>The risk in running 3dmod this way is that the function called by the
 * dialog may try to access the dialog through the normal channel (through the
 * manager or UIExpert), and user may have left that dialog.  This is why the
 * UIExperts don't set their dialog pointers to null on done().  It is unlikely
 * that there will be much communication with a dialog for a 3dmod process.  If
 * this does happen for a dialog managed by a manager instead of a UIExpert, it
 * may be a good idea create a UIExpert for this dialog.  This way the UIExpert
 * 3dmod function can talk to an out-of-date dialog that the user has left.
 * Note that, if the users goes back into the dialog, the 3dmod function will
 * talk to the up to date dialog, but the action function called by the
 * Run3dmodButton will call the action function in the out-of-date instance of
 * the dialog.  This is true unless the the Run3dmodButton is managed by the
 * ProcessResultsDisplayFactory.  In that case new instance of the dialog
 * contains the same instance of the Run3dmodButton as the ProcessSeries, and
 * container reference would be updated to that new dialog instance.</p>
 * 
 * <H3>Problems</H3>
 * 
 * <P>The dialogs being managed directly by the manager won't stick around after
 * the user leaves them (except for Tomogram Combination).  The Run3dmodButton
 * has access to them but the 3dmod function doesn't.  If this becomes a
 * problem, it can be handled by creating a UIExpert to manage the dialog.</P>
 * 
 * <P>The rule that the state of the dialog when a button is pushed is state
 * referred to by all subsequent processes, which may already have been broken
 * in Tomogram Combination, it being broken here in two ways.  One is when the
 * user stays on the dialog and changes something that action function or the
 * 3dmod function references.  The other is when the Run3dmodButton that runs
 * the 3dmod process is being managed by ProcessResultDisplayFactory, so that it
 * loses contact with the original dialog when the user leaves and goes back
 * into the dialog.</P>
 * 
 * <P>When the Run3dmodButton that runs the 3dmod process is not managed by the
 * ProcessResultsDisplayFactory then, if the user leaves and re-enters the
 * dialog, then dialog action function is called from the old instance of the
 * dialog, and the 3dmod function would talk to the new instance of the dialog.</P>
 * 
 * <H3>Possible upgrades</H3>
 * 
 * <P>If more then two regular processes have to be set by a process function in
 * a manager or UIExpert, or there is a ordering requirement that can't be
 * handled by the current next, last, 3dmod setup, it should be easy to add more
 * capacity to this class.  Add another process string or convert an existing
 * process to a queue of processes.</P>
 * 
 * <H3>What Not To Do</H3>
 * 
 * <P>Because the method used to run 3dmod is already problematic, don't use it
 * to allow the user to create their own series of processes (see the original
 * idea of bug# 847).  The problems associated with a process function talking
 * to a dialog are minor for 3dmod, but would be huge for other types of
 * processes.</P>

 * <p> which processes are next processes, pass it everywhere, even to
 * <p> processes that don't use ProcessResultDisplay.  The UI should not create
 * <p> any ProcessSeries and should pass them as null (since they don't know
 * <p> about processes).  Before adding to a process series, create it if it doesn't
 * <p> exist.  Before checking a process series, make sure it exists.  Since a
 * <p> series is only created when it doesn't exist and is needed, I don't have to
 * <p> keep track of which process comes first in a series.
