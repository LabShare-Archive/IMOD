# Allow the modifier to take variables and constants as parameters.

# This is probably not enough.  Would also have to take fields as parameters.
# This makes processing more complex because each command could contain multiple
# fields

# The basic problem is that this functionality has to be nested.  Nesting should
# be done by the autodoc parsing, not regular code.  This isn't possible without
# creating a second parser that parses the whole command language.  At that
# point I might as well look for or write a Java parser.

# Or I could try to create a library associated with each of the commands I want
# to use, such as assertEnabled(), gotoFrame(), pressButton(), and write actual
# Java test functions which call those library functions.  The basic
# structure of running the tests and switching between axes would also have to
# be in the library because it is complicated and should be reusable.  I would
# keep uitest.adoc as a way to describe the test.  Then I would make Java
# classes that each tested a single dialog, as a well as a class that
# called each dialog test.



# What does a return do inside an [[else = ]] statement?  Just break out to the
# if statement?  That doesn't make sense.  But that's how returns work.  Maybe
# add a break command.
