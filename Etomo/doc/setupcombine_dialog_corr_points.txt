:>setupcombine 
 
This program sets up the file combine.com for combining two tomograms.
There are no command line arguments.
Just answer each of the questions in turn.
To interrupt, type Ctrl-C then Return
 
Enter root name of data sets (omitting a or b and extension): hvemuni5
Enter letter of tomogram being matched TO (a or b): b

Specify the correspondence between fiducial points in the two tilt alignments.
Enter a list of the points in tilt series b for which you
are sure of the corresponding point in tilt series a
 (ranges may be entered).
Or just Return if the points are in one-to-one correspondence.
1-10
Enter a list of the corresponding points in tilt series a
1-10

Enter 0 to use models of corresponding points (hvemuni5b.matmod and
 hvemuni5a.matmod) to specify initial registration between tomograms;
 otherwise enter:
   1 if fiducials are on only one surface and tomograms are NOT inverted,
  -1 if fiducials are on only one surface and tomograms are inverted
           relative to each other, or
   2 if there are fiducials on both surfaces: 2

Enter s for small patches (64 x 32 x 64), m for medium patches (80 x 40 x 80),
 or l for large patches (100 x 50 x 100) (Return for m): s

Now specify the limits of the volume from which patches will be
      extracted by patchcrawl3d.
The default upper limits for X and Y are based on a border of 36 pixels.
Lower X (left) limit of area (Return for 36): 
Upper X (right) limit of area (Return for 988): 
Lower Y (bottom) limit of area in flipped tomogram (Return for 36): 
Upper Y (top) limit of area in flipped tomogram (Return for 988): 
Lower Z limit of volume (bottom slice) in flipped tomogram: 1
Upper Z limit of volume (top slice) in flipped tomogram: 180
Enter name of model file with contours enclosing patches to use for fits,
   or Return to use all patches: 
 
1226 MBytes of disk space will be needed for combining
If you want to use a local temporary directory, enter the path name of a
 directory in which the temporary directory can be created (e.g., /usr/tmp)
 or Return for no temporary directory: 
 
The number of patches for PATCHCRAWL3D is 10 in X, 4 in Y, and 10 in Z
   (Y and Z are not flipped on the PATCHCRAWL3D command line)
