  Findbeads3d will find gold partciles and other spherical densities in
  tomograms.  Given the diameter of the beads, it will search for particles of
  this size and store their locations in a model along with the strengths of
  their correlations with an average particle.  It will automatically
  determine the threshold strength that separates the gold particles from
  lesser densities.

  The search occurs in two phases.  First, density is summed over small cubes
  centered on each pixel, about 3/8 of the bead diameter on a side, and local
  peaks in the summed density are found.  The peak strength is measured by an
  integral of the densities relative to the background denisty.  When two of
  these candidate peaks are too close together, the weaker one is eliminated.
  The integrals are scaled so that they range up to 1, a subset of the
  strongest peaks are selected, and an average bead is obtained by extracting
  a small volume at each selected peak location.  By default, the subset is
  selected by analyzing a histogram of the peak strengths to find a dip
  separating the gold from weaker features; however, the -threshold option can
  be used to specify a number of peaks to use or a relative peak strength to
  use as the threshold.

  In the second phase, the average bead is cross-correlated with subvolumes at
  all of the candidate peak locations from the first phase.  This time the
  value of the cross-correlation (not a normalized correlation coefficient) is
  taken as the peak strength, and again they are scaled to range up to 1.  A
  selection of the strongest peak locations are then written to the output
  model.  Again, the default method for this selection is to analyze a
  histogram of peak strengths for a dip between beads and weaker peaks, but
  the number of points stored in the model can also be controlled with the
  -store option.  

  The output model consists of a scattered point object with one point per
  contour.  The peak strength is stored as a general value, and the object
  properties are generally set so that only points above threshold are
  displayed.  However, points below threshold generally do exist and need to be
  removed before reprojecting the points with Tilt(1).  To see all of the
  points, adjust the threshold, or delete points below the threshold, load the
  model into 3dmod and open the Bead Fixer in Seed mode.  The Bead Fixer will
  have a slider for adjusting the threshold, a checkbox to controlling whether
  points below threshold will be displayed, and a button to delete points
  below threshold.  Since these points are located on many Z planes, be sure
  to check "Delete on all sections" before deleting the points.

  The tomogram can be built from binned down aligned images, and the model
  will load correctly on an unbinned tomogram.  Also, a reprojection of the
  points by Tilt(1) will load correctly on an unbinned or a binned aligned
  stack.  Findbeads3d will work much faster on a binned tomogram and may even
  work better, as long as the bead size in the binned tomogram is at least 5
  pixels.

  Findbeads3d uses the PIP package for input exclusively (see the manual page 
  for pip(1)).  The following options can be specified either as command line
  arguments (with the -) or one per line in a command file or parameter file
  (without the -):
