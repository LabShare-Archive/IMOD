  Matchvol will transform a volume using a general linear
  transformation.  Its main use is to transform one tomogram from
  a two-axis tilt series so that it matches the other tomogram.
  To do so, it can combine an initial alignment transformation and
  any number of successive refining transformations.  The program
  uses the same algorithm as Rotatevol for rotating large volumes.

  Matchvol uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for pip(1))
  and can take input interactively for options that existed when it was
  converted, to maintain compatibility with old command files.  The
  following options can be specified either as command line arguments (with
  the -) or one per line in a command file or parameter file (without 
  the -):

INSERT OPTION TEXT HERE

  -StandardInput
     Read parameter entries from standard input.


  If the program is started with no command line arguments, it reverts to
  interactive input with the following entries:
	  
  Name of the input file to be transformed

  Name of the output file for the transformed volume

  Path name of directory (for example, /usr/tmp) where temporary files
     can be placed, or Return to have files placed in the current
     directory

  X, Y, and Z dimensions of the output file, or / to accept the default
     values, which are NZ, NY, and NX of the input volume (a 90-degree
     rotation about the Y axis)
  
  Number of successive transformations to combine and apply
  
  For each transformation, either enter the name of a file with
     the transformation, or enter a Return, then enter the 12-element
     transformation directly.  Transform files need not all occur before
     direct entries.
  
  Name of a file in which to place the inverse of the combined 
     transformation, or Return for no such output
