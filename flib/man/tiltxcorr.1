  TILTXCORR uses cross-correlation to find an initial translational
  alignment between successive images of a tilt series.  For a given
  pair of images, it stretches the image with the larger tilt angle
  perpendicular to the tilt axis, by an amount equal to the ratio of
  the cosines of the two tilt angles (cosine stretch).  The stretched
  image is correlated with the other image, and the position of the
  peak of the correlation indicates the relative shift between the
  images.  There are options to use only a subset of the image, to
  pad the image with a border before correlating, and to taper the
  image intensities down to the average level over some boundary
  region.  The latter feature is particularly important for getting
  reliable correlation peaks.  The program also has on option to
  ignore a central peak caused by fixed pattern noise in the images,
  which can be a serious problem unless digital camera images are well
  gain-normalized.  The program will reduce the size of images larger
  than 1024 pixels in one dimension by binning them down, i.e. by
  averaging the values in square sets of adjacent pixels (2x3, or 3x3,
  etc).  Images are binned by the smallest factor needed to make them
  1024 or smaller.

  Some notes about some of the options:
  
  Filtering: Some high pass filtering, using a small value of Sigma1
  such as 0.03, may be helpful to keep the program from being misled
  by very large scale features in the images.  If the images are
  noisy, some low pass filtering with Sigma2 and Radius2 is
  appropriate (e.g. 0.05 for Sigma2, 0.25 for Radius2).  If the images
  are binned, these values specify frequencies in the binned image, so
  a higher cutoff (less filtering) might be appropriate.
  
  The exclusion of a central peak can be essential when there is
  fixed noise in the images.  Because one image is stretched, this
  spurious peak can actually occur anywhere in an elongated region
  perpendicular to the tilt axis.  If the real alignment happens to
  fall in that streak, then it will be ignored as well, and an
  incorrect alignment will be found.  For this reason, this option 
  should be used only when necessary.
  
  Trimming some area off the edges of the images may be helpful if
  those areas are particularly out of focus or contain material with
  no useful features in it.
  
  Padding is customarily done to reduce the contribution to the
  correlation from wrapped around features, which occurs when
  correlation is done with Fourier transforms.  Extensive padding does
  not help with typical biological specimens but may be needed for
  specimens with periodic structures, in which case one should pad each
  edge by half the image size.
  
  In contrast, tapering the images down to a mean intensity at their
  edges is very important.  Tapering over as few as 20 pixels may be
  adequate, but fewer artifacts will appear in the correlation with
  longer tapers (say, 50 to 100 pixels).
  
  Entries to the program in order are:
  
  Image input file

  Piece list file for reordering the Z values in the stack, or Return
  if none

  Output file for F transforms
  
  -1 to enter individual tilt angle for each view, 1 to specify a
  starting and increment tilt, or 0 to read tilt angles from a file
  
  IF you entered 1, next enter the starting and incremental tilt angles
  IF you entered -1, enter the tilt angle of each view.
  IF you entered 0, enter name of file with tilt angles
  
  Angle of rotation of the tilt axis in the images; specifically, the
  angle from the vertical to the tilt axis (counterclockwise
  positive).

  Filter parameters to filter the correlation, or / for no filter
  (Enter values of Sigma1, Sigma2, Radius1, Radius2 just as for
  ENHANCE.)

  1 to exclude a central correlation peak due to fixed pattern noise
  in the images, or 0 not to
  
  Amounts to trim off each side in the X and Y dimensions, or / to use
  the whole image area
  
  Borders with which to pad images in the X and Y dimensions, or / for
  the default, which is 5% of the image dimensions up to 20 pixels
  
  Distances over which to taper image intensities down to the mean at
  the edges, in the X and Y dimensions.  Enter / for the default, which
  is 10% of the image dimensions up to 100 pixels.

  Starting and ending view #'s (first is 1), or / for all views
