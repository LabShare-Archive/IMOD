  MODEL2POINT will convert an IMOD or WIMP ascii model file to a
  list of points with integer coordinates.  Each point will be written
  on a separate line, and any information about which object or contour
  the point came from will be omitted.  The input file may be either
  an IMOD model or a WIMP ascii model file; the output file will
  contain the list of points.
  
  The program will accept file names either from the command line or as
  entries to the program after it is started.  If there are two names
  on the command line, they will be taken as the input and output file
  names; if there is one name, it will be taken as the input file name
  and the program will ask for the output file name; if there are no
  command line arguments, the program will ask for both input and
  output file names.
