  EXCISE will chop out pieces from an image file, at positions
  specified in a file of coordinates.  The file consists of three
  integer index coordinates per position (x, y, z), such as is put out
  by the POINT routine in WIMP.  The centers of the excised pieces can
  be offset from the point coordinates by specified amounts.  If a
  piece extends beyond the edge of the original image, it will be
  padded with the mean intensity of the input file.

  The inputs are:
  
  Input image file
  Name of piece list file if image is a montage; otherwise Return
  Name of file of point coordinates
  Name of output file for pieces
  X and Y dimensions of the output file
  X and Y offsets, which will be added to the point coordinates to
     obtain the coordinates of the center of each output piece
  
  The program can extract pieces from a montaged image file, but it
  will not do so properly if a piece falls in the overlap zone between
  montage frames.  It would have to be modified to do this properly.
