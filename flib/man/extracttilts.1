DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
  EXTRACTTILTS will extract tilt angles from the header of an image
  file, if they are present, and produce a file with a list of the
  angles.

  The Unix version will take the file names either on the command line
  or as entries to the program.  If there are no file names on the
  command line, the program asks for both the input and output file
  names.  If there is one file name on the command line, the program
  takes that as the input file and asks for the output file name.
  
  Entries to program:
  
  Image file with tilt information
  Output file for tilt angles
