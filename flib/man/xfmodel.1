   Will take an IMOD model , and either
   a) use corresponding points in two sections to obtain a transformation
      between the sections, or
   b) transform the points in the model to match a new alignment of images

	  To solve for transforms, the model objects should consist of
   corresponding points in two or more successive sections.  The program
   considers each pair of successive sections independently.  If an object
   contains two points in the same section, the program will take the point
   whose Z value is closer to that of the other section in the pair.

	The program can "edit" an existing list of f transforms (transforms
   that relate each section to the previous one).  That is, the model may
   have points from only a few sections, or one may specify which sections to
   find transforms for, and the program will output a list containing new
   transforms for those sections and transforms from the existing list for
   the rest.

	In solving for transforms, the model can be built on unaligned images
   or on images that have been aligned with a previously existing set of
   transforms.  In the latter case, the program will request the name of the
   appropriate file of g transforms used to align the images.

	A model that was built on unaligned images can be transformed to match
   with aligned images.  A model built on aligned images can be
   back-transformed to match the raw, unaligned images, or it can be
   transformed to match a new alignment of the images.  In all of these
   cases, the program will ask for the files with the appropriate sets of g
   transforms. 
	  
       When the program solves for the transformation between a pair of
   sections, it applies the transformation to the points on the second
   section of the pair, and computes the displacement, or deviation, between
   each point and the corresponding point on the first section of the pair.
   It then reports the mean deviation for all of the points, the maximum
   deviation, and the object number of the point with maximum deviation.
   In addition, you may elect to have a complete report of the deviations of
   all points for particularly bad sections.  If you choose this option, you
   control which sections are reported by specifying criterion values for the
   mean and maximum deviations; the full report will be made for any sections
   with mean or maximum deviations greater than the respective criteria.

	If the images are montaged, this is specified by entering the
   the name of the file of piece coordinates.  The Z values in this list of
   pieces are used to establish the correspondence between Z values in the
   model and transform number in the list of transforms.  If the image is
   missing some sections, the program will detect this fact and ask whether
   the transform lists contain a transform only for each existing section or
   a transform for each section number, including the missing sections.  The
   choice here will be applied both to lists of existing transforms that are
   read in and to the list that is computed by the program, if any.  In either
   case, if there are model objects that bridge a gap over missing
   sections, the program can compute a transform between the sections on
   either side of the gap.
	  
	  Instead of solving for transforms between pairs of adjacent sections,
  the typical mode of operation, the program can solve for transforms between
  a single specified section and each other section.  To use this feature,
  enter "-999" when the program requests a list of sections to find transforms
  for.  Next enter the number of the single section; a transform will be found
  relating each other section to that single section.  Then enter the true
  list of sections to find transforms for.

	  It is possible to find the X/Y translation alone that best aligns
  the set of points on a section to those on a previous section.  The
  resulting transformations (which involve no rotations or size changes)
  can be used in a second stage of model alignment to remove progressive
  shifts in position while retaining trends in size and rotation.  To obtain
  translations only, enter 2 rather than 0 when specifying that you want
  to find transformation.
	  
	  It is also possible to find the translation and rotation alone that
  best aligns two sections.  The resulting transformations (which involve no
  size changes) can be used in a second stage of model alignment to remove
  progressive shifts in position and rotations while retaining trends in size.
  To obtain translations and rotations only, enter 3 rather than 0 when
  specifying that you want to find transformation.

	  Just to round out the options, you can also enter 4 to obtain
  transformations that include translation, rotation, and magnification change
  but no stretch.

  ENTRIES TO THE PROGRAM
  
  Name of image file that model was built on, or blank line to enter
  center coordinates instead
  
  IF you entered an image file name, next enter the name of a piece
  list file if the image is a montage, otherwise enter a blank line
  
  OR if you did not enter an image file, next enter the X and Y index
  coordinates of the center of the image (NX/2, NY/2)
  
  IF there are gaps in the Z values described by the piece list, next
  enter 0 if transform files have transforms only for the Z values
  that exist, or 1 if they have transforms for all Z values
  
  Name of model file
  
  Enter one of:
  -1 to back-transform the model to fit a raw image stack
  0 to find linear transformations
  1 to transform the model with a set of transformations
  2 to find X/Y translations only
  3 to find translations and rotations
  4 to find translation, ratation, and mag change
  
  IF you entered any option other than -1 to back-transform, next enter
  0 if the model was built on raw sections, or the sections that you
  want to further transform; or 1 if the model was built on pre-aligned
  sections and you want to reference transforms to the raw sections
  
  IF you are back-transforming OR if you entered 1 to the last query,
  next enter the file name of the g transforms used to pre-align the 
  sections
  
  IF you are transforming or back-transforming the model, next enter
  the name of the output model file.  This is the final entry for
  option -1

  IF you are transforming, enter the name of the file with transforms
  to apply; this is the final entry for option 1
  
  IF you finding transforms instead, continue with the following
  entries:
  
  Name of file with existing f transforms to be replaced by any
  transforms that are solved for
  
  Name of output file for new f transforms
  
  A list of section numbers to find transforms for (the second section
  of each pair, sections numbered from zero), or / to find transforms
  for all sections with data in the model, or -999 to find transforms
  of all sections relative to a single section
  
  IF you entered -999, next enter:
     The number of the single section
     The real list of transforms to find sections for, or / for all
  
  1 for complete reports of the deviations for each point on sections
  with bad fits, or 0 for no detailed reports
  
  IF you entered 1, then enter a criterion for the mean deviation and
  a criterion for the maximum deviation; a complete report will be 
  given for any section that exceeds either criterion.
