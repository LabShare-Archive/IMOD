  Numericdiff compares the numeric contents of two text files.  It scans
  through each file, identifying sections of purely numeric text and sections
  with non-numeric text.  Within a section of numeric text, it reads the
  numbers from each file and finds the maximum absolute value of the
  difference between numbers in each column.  These maxima are reported for
  each numeric section, and if limits for the maximum differences are entered,
  the program reports that there are differences above the limits and exits
  with a non-zero status.

  The lines in a section may have different numbers of columns.  The two files
  can differ in the number of lines in a numeric section; the extra lines in
  one file will be ignored.  Sections of non-numeric text can also be
  different length between the two files.  However, there is no attempt to
  match the text in non-numeric sections, so both files must match in the way
  that they alternate between numeric and non-numeric text.

  Numericdiff uses the PIP package for input exclusively (see the manual page
  for pip(1)).  The following options can be specified either as command line
  arguments (with the -) or one per line in a command file or parameter file
  (without the -):
