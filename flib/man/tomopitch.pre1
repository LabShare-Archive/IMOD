  TOMOPITCH analyes simple models of the boundaries of the section in slices
  from a tomogram and recommends how much to change tilt angles to make the
  section flat, how much to shift the tilt axis in Z to produce centered
  slices, and how thick to make the slices.  It can also recommend how much
  X-axis tilt is needed to make the section flat in the orthogonal direction
  as well.  It can also be used with a model drawn on a whole tomogram,
  possibly binned down.
  
  The typical use is with samples of the tomogram in separate files.  For
  each sample of the tomogram, make a model file with two contours in it.
  Each contour should have two points, with the line between them lying
  along the top or bottom surface of the section.  The points do not have to
  be entered in any particular order, and the lines do not need to be any
  particular length (the program will extend them in X, if necessary, to
  within 5% of each edge of the tomogram).

  As an alternative to making a separate model file for each sample, you can
  load all of the samples into 3dmod together and make a single model file,
  creating a pair of contours at each different time index. Make this model
  file be the sole entry to Tomopitch, and it will analyze each of the time
  indexes separately, the same as if they were in separate files.

  A third alternative is to make a model on an entire tomogram.  Such a
  model can take two forms.  It can consist of any number of pairs of 
  horizontal lines, where each par is drawn predominantly in the X direction
  along the top and bottom of the section.  This can be done while viewing
  the YZ planes of the tomogram, just as in the samples of YZ slices.  The
  lines can also be drawn while viewing the XY planes of the tomogram in the
  Zap window, or they can be drawn in the Slicer window with the angles
  adjusted to make a surface appear all at once in the window.  These lines
  do not need to be parallel to the X axis, but try to draw the two lines of
  a pair at approximately the same location in Y.  The program expects the
  separation in Y between the two lines of a pair to be less than 0.3 times
  the separation between successive pairs.

  The second form for a model on a whole tomogram consists of a pair of
  horizontal lines near the middle of the tomogram, and a pair of lines
  oriented vertically (predominantly in the Y direction) along the top and
  bottom of the tomogram.  Only one pair of lines of each type is allowed.
  With this input, the program will construct two more pairs of horizontal
  lines by sliding the pair that were entered to the low Y and high Y ends
  of the vertical lines.  Analysis then proceeds with the three pairs of
  horizontal lines.

  If you make a model on an entire tomogram, you need not enter a value for
  the spacing in Y.  If the tomogram is binned down relative to the final
  tomogram, enter the binning factor as a scale factor to get values
  appropriate for the final tomogram.

  The program analyzes each pair of horizontal lines separately.  It
  determines what rotation is required to make the section be flat.  It
  reports the upward shift needed to center the section in Y, and the slice
  thickness needed to contain the section.  These values are derived and
  reported  before and after the recommended rotation is applied.  Thickness
  values include an additional amount that you specify and are rounded up to
  integers suitable for taking 3D FFTs.  After all pairs of lines are
  analyzed, the program makes the same analysis and report based on the data
  from all of the files.  It then computes an X-axis tilt and reports
  thickness and rotation if that tilt is taken into account as well.
  
  Tomopitch uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for pip(1))
  and can take input interactively for options that existed when it was
  converted, to maintain compatibility with old command files.  The
  following options can be specified either as command line arguments (with
  the -) or one per line in a command file or parameter file (without 
  the -):

INSERT OPTION TEXT HERE

  -StandardInput
     Read parameter entries from standard input.


  If the program is started with no command line arguments, it reverts to
  interactive input with the following entries:

  Additional pixels of thickness to add to both the top and the bottom
  of the tomogram, beyond the region described by the model lines.

  Spacing between tomogram samples (the distance in Y in the tilt 
  images.)  If a non-zero number is entered, the program will
  compute the tilt around the X-axis that will make the tomogram be
  flat in its Z dimension.

  Number of model files to analyze
  
  For each file, then enter the name of the file.
