	  FILLTOMO improves a combined tomogram from a two-axis
	  tilt series by replacing pixels in locations where the "matching"
	  tomogram had no data with the values from the tomogram that was 
	  matched to.  It determines a linear scaling between the latter
	  tomogram and the combined tomogram so that the intensities will
	  match as well as possible.
	  
	  Inputs to the program:
	  
	  Name of combined tomogram file
	  
	  Name of the tomogram that was matched TO, which will be the source of
	     replacement values
	  
	  Either the name of the tomogram that was transformed to match, or the
	     X, Y and Z dimensions of that file
	  
	  Name of file containing inverse transformation used by MATCHVOL

	  Number of pixels to replace unconditionally along the four sides
	  of the tomogram when in flipped orientation.  Enter four numbers,
	  for the number of pixels on the left (lower X), right (upper X),
	  bottom (lower Y in flipped tomogram), and top (upper Y) edges.
