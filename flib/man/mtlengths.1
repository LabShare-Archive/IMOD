  MTLENGTHS computes the lengths, in microns, of contours in
  IMOD models, and produces a list giving the object number and contour
  length for each contour.  This list may be used to generate a
  histogram of lengths with a program such as GENHSTPLT.  One may
  optionally add a certain amount of length to each contour at its
  high Z end, so that the length calculation will include the
  thickness of every section in which a contour appears.
  
  If the sections were significantly tilted during microscopy, the
  program can adjust for these tilts given the proper information.
  Prepare a file in which the first line shows the Z value and the
  tilt of the first tilted section (or of the first section, if that
  one was tilted), and each successive line shows the Z value and tilt
  for each section on which tilt was changed.  Z values should occur in
  ascending order.

  Entries to the program are:
  
  Name of model file
  
  Name of file with tilt information, or Return if none
  
  IF the model has no scaling information in its header, make the
  following three entries:

     Magnification of negatives (without any commas)
  
     Scale, in microns per pixel, at which negatives were digitized
  
     Section thickness in nanometers
  
  Amount to add to the high Z end of each object in order to account
     for section thickness.  For example, enter 1 to allow a section's
     worth of length for each section that an object appears in.

  Name of output file in which to place list of lengths, or Return for
     output to the terminal
  
  List of IMOD objects to exclude from the output, or Return to output
     all objects.  If the data are from a WIMP model, the IMOD object
     number is 256 minus the WIMP color (1 for 255, etc.), or the
     negative of this value for WIMP objects that are turned off.
