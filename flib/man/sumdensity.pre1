  Sumdensity will sum the density within contours of selected IMOD model
  objects.  Pixels within a specified distance of the boundary contour can be
  excluded.  A threshold can be set so that only pixels above threshold are
  summed, and the threshold value is subtracted from the pixel values in the
  sum.  Data are reported by surface if there are surfaces defined in the model
  contours.

  The threshold density must be specified in one of three ways.  It can be
  entered as an absolute density value, such as one would view in the Pixel
  View window in 3dmod.  If you do not want to apply a threshold at all you
  could specify the minimum density in the file, or zero, whichever is less.
  The second way to enter the density is as a contrast setting.  Load the data
  into 3dmod without any intensity scaling (i.e., without using "-s").  Bring
  the black and white sliders together and adjust until structures of interest
  are selected by the threshold.  The slider value would be entered with the
  "-contrast" option.  Finally, one can draw contours around reference areas
  that contain the desired baseline density.  The mean of density within these
  contours will be taken as the threshold density.  All of these contours
  should be in a single object specified with "-reference".

  The output of the program consists of a summary of the number of pixels
  within the contour (after excluding the border region), the number of pixels
  above the threshold, the percent of pixels above threshold, and the sum and
  average of the densities above threshold.  These values are reported for
  each surface in an object, then for the sum of all surfaces.  With the
  "-verbose" option, values are reported for each contour.

  The program will detect contours that are nested inside other contours and
  exclude pixels that are inside or with a border distance of inner contours.
  There can be any number of levels of nested contours, and in the general
  case the program will exclude pixels that are inside an even-level contour
  but not inside an odd-level contour contained within it (where the outermost
  contour is considered level 1).

  Sumdensity uses the PIP package for input exclusively (see the manual page
  for pip(1)).  The following options can be specified either as command line
  arguments (with the -) or one per line in a command file or parameter file
  (without the -):
