  A simple program to read and display the information in the 
  header of an MRC image file - image size, data type, min, max, etc.
  The program will accept the file name either from the command line or
  as an entry to the program after it is started.  If there is no file
  name or other arguments on the command line, the program asks for an 
  input file name.

  If no options are given, the program will print the complete standard header
  output.  If any of the output options describe below are given, then the
  program prints only the numeric output for the given options, without any
  descriptive labels.  If multiple options are given, each option will produce
  one line of numeric output, with the output in the order that the options
  appear below (and that the output appears in the standard header output).
  If multiple file names are entered, then all of the header entries will be
  printed for one file, then for the next, etc.

  The options are processed by the PIP package (see man page for pip(1)).
  Options can be abbreviated to unique letters; the currently valid
  abbreviations for short names are shown in parentheses.  They are:

INSERT OPTION TEXT HERE

  -StandardInput
     Read parameter entries from standard input.
