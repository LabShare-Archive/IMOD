  Findwarp will solve for a series of general 3-dimensional linear
  transformations that can then be used by Warpvol(1) to align two volumes
  to each other.  It performs a series of multiple linear regression on
  local sets of the displacements between the volumes determined at a matrix
  of positions (patches).  The displacements must be contained in a file
  with the following form: 

  Number of displacements
  One line for each displacement consisting of the X, Y, and Z
     coordinates in the first volume, then the displacements in X, Y
     and Z involved in moving from the first to the second volume
  
  The program has two basic modes of operation.  In one mode, it will
  compute a solution for a specified number of patches to be included in
  each local fit.  In the other mode, it automatically searches for the
  largest number of patches that gives local fits with mean residuals less
  than a specified criterion.  These modes behave differently depending on
  whether the program is run with parameter input via the PIP interface or
  via interactive input.  With parameter input, the program will either
  run one set of local fits with a given number of patches, or find the best
  warping automatically.  If the program is run interactively, it loops on
  the specification of the subsets of displacements to use until the user
  decides to write out a particular subset.  However, at any point it can be
  told to find the best warping automatically with the current set of
  parameters, in which case it does so then exits.

  The program will automatically eliminate "outliers", patch displacements
  that are likely to be incorrect because they are so extreme, when compared
  to the rest of the displacements.  This elimination is conservative, but
  if for some reason it operates incorrectly, you can control the parameters
  of elimination or stop the elimination from occurring.  By default, the
  program will eliminate up to 10% of the patches from each local fit.
  
  The program also provides two methods for fitting to only a subset of the
  data.  One method is to eliminate whole rows or columns of patches. The
  other is to use a model file to specify which patches to include in the
  fit.  This model can be quite simple, consisting of just a single contour
  enclosing the region where patches are generally good.  This contour can
  be drawn in any Z plane of the volume.  However, if the good region
  changes through the depth of the tomogram, you can draw contours at
  several Z levels.  If you have two layers of patches, draw two contours,
  one near the top and one near the bottom of the tomogram; if you have
  three layers, add another contour in the middle, etc.  For a given patch,
  the program will find the contour at the nearest Z level and use that one
  to determine whether to include the patch.

  In addition, the program will work with a patch file from which bad
  patches have been removed by hand.  This may become necessary if bad
  patches are too frequent in some location to be eliminated as outliers.
  To use this feature, use Patch2imod(1) to convert the patch file to a
  model file where displacements are represented by vectors, examine the
  file in 3dmod, eliminate aberrant contours, and convert the model file to
  a new patch file with Imod2patch(1).

  If there is only one layer of patches in the thin dimension, there is
  insufficient information to solve for the full transformation, so the
  program will solve for only two of the three columns of each local
  transformation matrix, and keep the third column of each matrix fixed.
  The same procedure is used if a particular local area does not have
  sufficient data on more than one layer in the thin dimension.

  For a given arrangement of patches, the program finds a mean and maximum
  residual for each of the fits.  It first reports how many points have been
  eliminated as outliers, in how many fits they appeared to be outliers, and
  a summary of the distribution of their residuals.  On one line, it next
  reports the average and the maximum of the mean residuals.  On the next
  line, it reports the average and maximum of the maximum residuals.  The
  goal is to find an arrangement that contains as many patches as possible
  in each direction yet has residuals comparable to those found with a
  volume that does not need warping (typically 0.1 to 0.2).

  Findwarp uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for pip(1))
  but can still take input interactively for exploring the effect of varying
  parameters.  The following options can be specified either as command line
  arguments (with the -) or one per line in a command file or parameter file
  (without the -).  Options can be abbreviated to unique letters; the
  currently valid abbreviations for short names are shown in parentheses.

INSERT OPTION TEXT HERE

  -StandardInput
     Read parameter entries from standard input.


  If the program is started with no command line arguments, it takes
  interactive input with the following entries:
  
  Name of file with positions and displacements

  (At this point the program will report the number of patches in X, Y,
     and Z in this file, or complain if the data do not have the
     proper form.)
  
  Either the file name, or the X, Y, and Z dimensions of the volume being 
     matched to.
  
  Name of an Imod model file with contours enclosing the patches to
     be included in the fit, or Return to use all patches.

  0 to proceed interactively, or 1 to find best warping automatically
  
  IF you enter 1, next enter:
  
     One or more target mean residuals to achieve.

     The minimum and maximum ratio of measurements to unknowns to be
       allowed in the local fits, or / to use the default values.

  0 to use all of the data, or 1 to specify a subset of patches to use
  
  IF you enter 1, next enter three lines:
  
     Number of columns of patches to eliminate from the left and right
       sides of the data, 0,0 to use all patches in X, or / to use previous
       values.

     Number of rows or slabs of patches to eliminate from the lower and
       upper extent in Y, 0,0 to use all patches in Y, or / to use previous
       values.

     Number of slabs or rows of patches to eliminate from the lower and
       upper extent in Z, 0,0 to use all patches in Z, or / to use previous
       values.

  IF you selected automatic warping, the program now proceeds by fitting to
     the largest possible area that does not exceed the maximum ratio of
     measurements to unknowns, and it tries progressively smaller areas
     until the desired mean residual is achieved.  It does this using the
     parameters (e.g., row or column elimination) that were set on any
     previous interactive rounds of fitting.  If the target residual is
     reached, it requests the names of the initial transformation file and
     the output file, as described below, and exits.  If the residual is not
     reached, it tries the next target residual if any, and if no targets
     are met, it exits with an error.
  
  IF you are proceeding interactively, continue with the following:

  IF there are more than 2 patches in the thin dimension, the program next
     asks whether you always want to do the local fits to all patches in
     that dimension.  Just enter 0 for the typical situation.
  
  0 to use default parameters for outlier elimination, or 1 to adjust
     any of these parameters.  Just enter 0 unless you know better.
  
  IF you enter 1, then make four entries, or / to take the default:
  
     Maximum fraction of patches to eliminate from each fit.  Set this
       to 0 to stop the outlier elimination from occurring.
  
     The minimum residual for elimination; patches with residuals
       smaller than this value will be retained no matter how extreme
       they are relative to the other patches.
  
     Criterion probability for patches to be considered candidates for
       for elimination.  A smaller value will eliminate fewer patches.
  
     Criterion probability for patches to be eliminated regardless of
       the pattern of outliers.  A higher value may force the
       elimination of more patches.

  Number of local patches in X and Y, X and Z, or X, Y, and Z to include in
     each fit. These values must be at least 2 and no larger than the total
     number of patches in the respective direction.
  
  The program will loop on the last entry until the same numbers are entered
  twice in a row (e.g. with a /).  If you enter 0 for the number of patches
  in X, it will loop back to the query about whether you want to find
  warping automatically.  When you do enter a /, it will request:
  
  Name of file with initial 3D transformation that was applied to one of the
     volumes before the patch correlation, or Return if there was no such
     file.  The format of such a file is described in the Matchvol(1) man
     page.

  Name of output file in which to place the transformations.  These will be
     inverse transformations, ready for use by Warpvol(1).
  
  An exception to the above occurs if you specify that all available patches
  are to be used in a single fit.  You would do this if you just needed to
  eliminate a row or column of patches from the fit.  In this case, when you
  enter a /, the program will simply ask for the name of a file in which to
  place the single refining transformation, just as with Refinematch(1).
