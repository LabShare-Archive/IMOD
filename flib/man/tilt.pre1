  Tilt is a program for reconstructing a three-dimensional object from a
  series of two-dimensional projections.  The projections are assumed to arise
  from rotation about a fixed tilt axis, subject to minor variations from this
  scheme.

  The program uses a number of different numerical strategies depending on
  whether the reconstructed volume is rotated around the X axis and depending
  on the amount of memory available.  If there is no X-axis tilt being
  imposed, then each output plane is derived from one line of the input data.
  The program tries first to use the fast backprojection algorithm developed
  by Sandberg and Beylkin, if there is a license.  If there is insufficient
  memory for this, or if other preconditions are not satisfied, it then tries
  to use preliminary stretching of each input line by the cosine of the tilt
  angle, which speeds up the direct backprojection.  If there is not enough
  memory for this method either, the program falls back to direct
  backprojection from the unstretched input lines. 

  When a tilt around the X axis is specified, then each output slice derives
  from several lines of input data.  The program tries to do this first by
  computing untilted slices, one per input line, and interpolating an output
  slice from the relevant untilted slices.  It uses fast backprojection if
  possible; if not, it tries to use cosine stretching if possible, or falls
  back to direct computation.  If there is insufficient memory for this
  approach, the program reverts to "old-style" X-axis tilting, in which the
  output slice is computed directly from the various input slices.  In this
  case,it also tries to use cosine stretching if memory is available.

  The user can disable various strategies by specifying an interpolation order
  of 0: cosine stretching by entering "COSINTERP 0", fast backprojection by
  entering "FBPINTERP 0", or the new style of X-axis tilting by entering
  "XTILTINTERP 0".  There are some cases where the fast backprojection is
  slower than the conventional approach (e.g., few input views).  The program
  attempts to detect these cases and use conventional summation instead.  If
  you use "FBPINTERP 1", you can bypass this checking and force the program to
  use fast backprojection as long as other conditions are met.

  With perpendicular slices, the header of the output file will set up a
  coordinate system congruent with that of the original views.  If slices are
  output in order of increasing slice number, this represents a 90 degree
  rotation about X, so the slices are inverted about their new Z axis (by
  using the negative of the tilt angles).  If slices are output in inverted
  order (IDELSLICE < 0), this represents a -90 degree rotation about X; slices
  are not inverted in this case. 

  The program can do two different kinds of reprojections.  First, it can
  compute each tomogram slice as usual then, instead of writing the slice to
  the output file, it outputs a reprojection of that slice at selected
  angles.  This reprojection should match what xyzproj(1) would produce by
  reprojecting from the tomogram, but it will not match the input images if
  the reconstruction is computed with a fixed or variable X axis tilt, Z
  factors, or local alignments.  Getting a reprojection that matches input
  images in any of these cases requires multiple slices of reconstruction to
  get one line of reprojection.  Thus, these reprojections are obtained by
  first computing the full reconstruction, then providing this file as input
  to the program on a second run.  On that run, the program needs to know
  about all the parameters used to make the reconstruction, as well as about
  the original projection file.

  The scaling of data by the backprojection is somewhat unpredictable.  If the
  radial filter were scaled to go from 0 at zero frequency to 1 at 0.5
  cycle/pixel, then the backprojection would produce numbers that correspond
  approximately to the underlying densities; i.e., their reprojection by
  summation would give numbers comparable to those in the input projections.
  Unfortunately, the radial filter goes from 0 to NX / 2, where NX is the X
  dimension of the input data.  This means that in order to get output
  that would reproject to give values comparable to the input, you would need
  to: a) not take the log of the data; and b) set the scaling factor in the
  SCALE entry to 2/NX.  

  The scaling of data in the reprojection from a tomogram takes the
  backprojection scaling into account.  Specifically, the program first undoes
  the output scaling that was specified by the SCALE entry, then it multiplies
  by 2.2 / NX.  The reprojection is computed by summing these unscaled
  values.  If the log was not being taken in the backprojection, these sums
  are then divided by the weighting factors entered with WeightFile, if any,
  and output.  If the log was taken, the sums are adjusted by adding an amount
  that should give a constant mean level, then the exponential is taken.

  Tilt uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for pip(1)) but
  it has several special features to maintain compatibility with the old
  input method and old command files.  1) Options are case-insensitive and can
  be entered in upper, lower, or mixed case.  2) If the program is started
  with no command line arguments, it behaves as if -StandardInput were given
  and takes lines from standard input.  3) The first two lines taken from
  standard input can be the input and output filenames, without their
  respective keywords.  This will not work if the filenames match a subset
  of any of the option strings.

  The following options can be specified either as command line arguments
  (with the -) or one per line in a command file or parameter file (without
  the -):

  Originally written by Mike Lawrence.  Storage of tilt angle data 
  altered by Guy Vigers; angles can be stored in image stack header by
  the program ALTERHEADER.
  David Mastronarde added ability to output slices at selected
  intervals and in inverse direction, and setting of header
  information so that coordinates correspond between output file and
  tilt data set.  Also added ability to specify a subset of views to
  use or exclude, control of output mode, abilities to take log,
  replicate views, enter specific tilt angles or read in angles from a
  file, adjust for compression, set width of output, and shift the
  output.  Implemented weighting by local tilt increment and padding
  before filtering.  Added ability to adjust for tilt around the X axis
  and to use local alignments.  Implemented subroutine calls for the
  inner loops so that assembly code could be adjusted to minimize very
  slow steps on the PC.  Implemented cosine stretching of the input
  data as an alternative solution to this problem that is faster on
  all machines.  Incorporated the fast backprojection code developed by
  Kristian Sandberg and Gregory Beylkin.  Implemented X-axis tilting
  by interpolation from untilted slices, so that the fast
  backprojection could be used with X-axis tilting.
