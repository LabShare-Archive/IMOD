  Edmont is a general montage editor than can be used to extract a subset of
  a montage, combine multiple montaged files or split a montage into multiple
  files, rescale images to a common range or mean of density, and  bin the
  montage pieces.  
         
  If there are piece coordinates in the extended header of the image file,
  the program will transfer those coordinates to the output file.  These
  coordinates can be used instead of ones from a piece list file.  If one
  wishes to have sections numbered sequentially from zero, or the X and Y
  coordinates of an extracted subset of pieces shifted to start at zero, the
  coordinates in the header of the output file will be modified
  appropriately.

  The general requirement when combining multiple montages is that they all
  have the same image size and overlap between adjacent pieces, and that
  they all fit on the same regular grid of positions.  They may have
  different numbers of pieces in each direction, and pieces at different
  locations; indeed, it is possible to assemble a montage from different files
  containing laterally adjacent pieces.
  
  If floating is not selected, data are rescaled uniformly, if necessary, to
  fit a new output data mode.  Specifically, data will be rescaled when going
  between byte and signed or unsigned integer modes, but only by the
  difference in data range between input and output modes.  Use the -1
  floating option to have the data scaled to fill the data range instead.  If
  the input file has real data (mode 2) that is not confined to the range of
  the output mode, then you must specify one of the three kinds of floating
  to avoid truncating the data.

  Edmont uses the PIP package for input exclusively (see the manual page
  for pip(1)).  The following options can be specified either as command line
  arguments (with the -) or one per line in a command file or parameter file
  (without the -).  Options can be abbreviated to unique letters; the
  currently valid abbreviations for short names are shown in parentheses.

  Written by David Mastronarde, 5/9/89
  1999: added ability to knock out pieces.
  1/3/00: made it handle extra header data, made scaling logic more
  like NEWSTACK and made sure it could handle negative integers. 
  10/24/00: made it actually use coordinates in header and renumber
  sections sequentially.
  7/2/10: Converted to PIP, used memory allocation, added many error checks,

  default section lists, binning, shifting, subsetting by frame number, and
  more flexibility in assembling montages.
