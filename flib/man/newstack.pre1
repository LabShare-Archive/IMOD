  Newstack is a general stack editor to move images into, out of, or between
  stacks.  It can float the images to a common range or mean of density. It
  can bin images and apply a general linear transformations as well as a
  specified rotation or expansion. It can put the output into a smaller or
  larger array and independently recenter each image separately from the
  transformation.  Images can be taken from multiple input files and placed
  into multiple output files.
   
  Newstack uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for pip(1))
  and can take input interactively only for options available before
  conversion to PIP, to maintain compatibility with old command files.  The
  options accepted by the old newst script are all accepted by newstack.
  Almost all options can be abbreviated to one or two letters.  The following
  options can be specified either as command line arguments (with the -) or
  one per line in a command file or parameter file (without the -):

INSERT OPTION TEXT HERE

  -StandardInput
     Read parameter entries from standard input.

  If no command line arguments are entered, inputs are prompted interactively.
  The input is as follows; lines starting with IF are entered only if a
  particular option is selected.

  Number of input files, or -1 to enter list of files from a file

  IF you enter a number >0, then for each input file, enter two lines:
   	File name
   	list of section numbers to take from that file.  The first section is
   		numbered 0 and ranges may be entered (e.g. 0-4,5,7-9)

  OTHERWISE, IF you enter -1, then enter the name of the file with list of
   		files and sections.  The format of this file should be
     Number of input files
     File name
     list of section numbers (first is 0!!!), ranges allowed (e.g. 0-3,5,7-9)
     next file and list of sections, etc.

  Number of output files, or -1 to enter list of files from a file

  IF you enter 1, next enter the name of the single output file.

  OR IF you enter a number >1, then for each output file, enter two lines:
   	File name
   	Number of sections to put in that file

  OR IF you enter -1, then enter the name of the file with the list of files
   	and numbers of of sections.  The format of this file is:
     Number of output files
     File name
     number of sections to place in that file
     next file and number of sections, etc.

  The X and Y dimensions of the output file, or / to take the same
   	dimensions as the first input file

  The data mode of the output file, or / to take the same mode as the first
      input file.  Mode can be 0 for bytes, 1 for 16-bit integers, 2 for 
      32-bit real numbers, or 9 to 15 for 9 to 15 bit values.

  0 for no offsets, or 1 to apply X and Y offsets separately to each section,
      or -1 to apply the same X and Y offset to all sections

  IF offsets are selected, next specify the X and Y center offsets of
     each of the sections (they need not be on separate lines), or the single
     offset to apply to all sections.
     Hint: offsets of 50,50 will take the center of the output image
     from the upper right quadrant of the input image.

  0 for no transforms, or 1 to transform images using cubic interpolation, or
     2 to transform using bilinear interpolation

  IF transforming is selected, next specify the file for transforms, and
     on a separate line, a list of lines to use in the file (first is 0!!!).
     Ranges are allowed here, but all must be on one line.  To have a single
     transform applied to all of the sections, just enter a single number.

  0 for no floating of densities, 1 to float densities so that each section
       occupies the same RANGE of densities (the optimum range for the
	particular data mode), 2 to float so that all sections have the same
       MEAN and STANDARD DEVIATION of density (which requires the input
       sections to be read twice), -1 to specify a single scaling that will
       be applied equally to all sections, -2 to scale all sections by the
       same amount, determined by black and white contrast settings, in order
       to convert to bytes with stretched contrast, 3 to SHIFT sections to
       the same mean value without rescaling, or 4 to SHIFT sections to the 
       same mean then rescale all sections by the same specified scaling.
         
  IF single rescaling is selected with "-1", next specify the density values
       to which the minimum and maximum in the data file should be mapped, or
       just enter "/" to have them mapped to the full-scale range for the
       data mode, or enter "1,1" to override any scaling of data that would
       otherwise occur because of a change of mode.  This scaling method can
       be used to invert densities by entering, e.g., 255,0.

  IF scaling by black and white contrast settings is selected with -2, next
       enter the black and white settings (see mrcbyte(1)).

  OR, IF shifting and rescaling was selected with "4", next specify the
       density values to which the new, shifted minimum and maximum values
       should be mapped, or just enter "/" to have them mapped to the full-
       scale range for the data mode.

  The program will adjust the pixel spacing in the header of the output file
  if binning and/or the expansion option are used.  Models built on the input
  file in 3dmod should display correctly on a file scaled by these two
  options.  However, the image origin is not adjusted for images that are a
  subset of the input image, so it would be necessary to shift a model
  manually in 3dmod to display it on a subset.

  When there is a change of modes, data are rescaled optimally in most
  cases. If floating is not selected, the scaling is by an amount that would
  map the range for the input data mode into the range for the output data
  mode (e.g., going from mode 1 to mode 2, it would scale data up by a factor
  of 128).  Generally, all sections will be rescaled by the same amount, thus
  preserving relative differences between sections.  However, if the output
  mode is 2 (reals), this kind of rescaling will not occur.  In general, if
  your input mode is real and you are outputing to bytes or integers, you need
  to specify some kind of floating, shifting, or scaling in order to get
  usable values.  These same kinds of automatic scalings upon change of mode
  will occur with shifting to a common mean (option 3), but here the program
  is more careful to apply the same scaling to all sections.  To disable the
  scaling upon change of mode, the use the option "-scale 1,1," or the "-1"
  floating option with interactive input.
         
  At the end, the program will report how many pixels have been truncated at
  the low or high limits of the output range.  If this happens after shifting
  with a specified output range, try again with a slightly smaller range.

  Complex data (Fourier transforms) can be stacked but not otherwise  
  manipulated.  Don't try to change the size or center of the FFT's.

  Newstack will not work with color data (MRC data mode 16).  If your images
  came from color Tiff files and you do not need the color information, use
  the "-g" option when converting them with Tif2mrc.  If you do need to 
  preserve the color information, then you can split the color channels into
  three byte-mode files with "clip splitrgb", use Newstack to perform
  identical operations on each of the three files, and recombine the data into
  a color file with "clip joinrgb".
         
  The program attempts to allocate enough memory to hold an entire input
  image and output image in 4 bytes per pixel, but it can work on large images
  with less memory than this by reading, operating on, and writing strips of
  the image if necessary.  On a 32-bit system, if the memory allocation fails,
  it will try to work with just under 2 GB of memory.  Memory allocation will
  probably not fail on a 64-bit system.  In either case, system performance
  will suffer if the program allocates more than the amount of memory
  available, and it is up to the user to limit the memory as appropriate with
  the "-memory" option.  The ability to work on the image in strips is limited
  when images are rotated by large angles (30-90 degrees); in such cases the
  program will need at least enough memory to hold the whole input images.

  Each linear transformation in a transform file is specified by a line with 
  six numbers:
    A11 A12 A21 A22 DX DY
  where the coordinate (X, Y) is transformed to (X', Y') by:
    X' = A11 * X + A12 * Y + DX
    Y' = A21 * X + A22 * Y + DY
