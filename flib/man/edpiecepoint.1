  This program allows one to "edit" a list of piece coordinates, or a
  list of point coordinates, in two ways:
  1) The set of Z values may be mapped, one-to-one, to any arbitrary
  new set of Z values; and
  2) The X, Y or Z coordinates of all pieces or points may be shifted
  by a constant.
  
  The program allows one to digitize a set of serial sections in
  inverse order, if that is more convenient that doing it in the proper
  order.  Simply enter "-1" at the entry of the new list of Z values,
  then enter "0,0,ZMAX" as the values to add to the X, Y and Z
  coordinates, where ZMAX is the desired maximum Z value.  (This
  assumes that the Z values in the original list start at 0; otherwise
  a different ZMAX would be needed.)
  
  ENTRIES:
  
  Name of input piece or point list file, or Return if none
  
  IF you enter "Return", then the program will create a dummy piece
     list.  Enter the number (N) of piece coordinates to set up.  The
     piece coordinates will all be (0,0), with Z running from 0 to N-1.
  
  Name of output piece or point list file
  
  New list of Z values.  Using ranges (e.g. 0-3,5-7), specify a list 
     with the same number of Z values as in the input list.  The
     Z values in the input list will be mapped one-to-one onto the new
     list.  Enter "/" to take the input list without modification
     Enter numbers between -999 and -990 to delete points with a
     particular Z value; e.g. if the input list has Z values from 0
     to 9, entering 0-4,-999,5-8 will delete all points with Z between
     4.5 and 5.5, and shift the Z of points with Z greater then 5.5
     down by 1.  If the input list has Z from 0-19, entering
     0-9,-999--990 will remove all pooints with Z from 10 to 19.
     Enter -1 to replace each Z value with its negative.
  
  Amounts to add to all X, Y, and Z coordinates.  These values will be
     added after the remapping of Z values, if any.
