  This program allows one to "edit" a list of piece coordinates, or a
  list of integer point coordinates, in two ways:
  1) The set of Z values may be mapped, one-to-one, to any arbitrary
  new set of Z values; and
  2) The X, Y or Z coordinates of all pieces or points may be shifted
  by a constant.
  In addition, one can make up a new piece list for single frame images or
  montaged images.  The pieces can be ordered in rows or in columns.
  
  The program allows one to digitize a set of images in inverse order, if that
  is more convenient that doing it in the proper order.  Simply enter "-1" at
  the entry of the new list of Z values, then enter "0,0,ZMAX" as the values
  to add to the X, Y and Z coordinates, where ZMAX is the desired maximum Z
  value.  (This assumes that the Z values in the original list start at 0;
  otherwise a different ZMAX would be needed.)
  
  ENTRIES:
  
  Name of input piece or point list file, or Return if none
  
  IF you enter "Return", then the program will create a new piece
     list.  Then make the following 4 entries:
     
     Number of sections (N) for which to make piece coordinates.  The Z
       coordinates will initially run from 0 to N-1, and the lower left X and
       Y coordinates will be 0.

     Number of pieces in X and in Y (enter / for 1,1)

     Spacing between pieces in X and in Y.  This spacing is the frame size 
       minus the overlap; e.g., for a size of 2048 and an overlap of 10%, one
       would enter 2048 - 204 = 1844.  Spacing can be measured by taking the
       difference between the coordinates of corresponding points in adjacent
       pieces.  For example, if a feature is at an X coordinate of 1800 in one
       piece and at 100 in the piece to the right, then the spacing in X is
       1800 - 100 = 1700.  Enter a negative number for X spacing if pieces are
       ordered from right to left, or a negative number for Y spacing if
       pieces are ordered from top to bottom.  Enter / if you just have one
       piece.

     0 if pieces progress along rows in the image file, or 1 if they progress
     along columns.
  
  Name of output piece or point list file
  
  New list of Z values.  Using ranges (e.g. 0-3,5-7), specify a list 
     with the same number of Z values as in the input list.  The
     Z values in the input list will be mapped one-to-one onto the new
     list.  Enter "/" to take the input list without modification
     Enter numbers between -999 and -990 to delete points with a
     particular Z value; e.g. if the input list has Z values from 0
     to 9, entering 0-4,-999,5-8 will delete all points with Z between
     4.5 and 5.5, and shift the Z of points with Z greater then 5.5
     down by 1.  If the input list has Z from 0-19, entering
     0-9,-999--990 will remove all pooints with Z from 10 to 19.
     Enter -1 to replace each Z value with its negative.
  
  Amounts to add to all X, Y, and Z coordinates.  These values will be
     added after the remapping of Z values, if any.
