  This program replaces deviant pixels with interpolated values from
  surrounding pixels.  It is designed to correct defects in electron
  microscope images from CCD cameras.  The program can replace a group
  of adjacent pixels with interpolated values, or all of the pixels 
  along a line.  It can do this on only a specific image, or on all of
  the sections in the file.

  To use the program, first prepare an IMOD model file to specify the
  points to be replaced.  There should be up to four separate objects:
  one for patches of points to be replaced on each section; one for 
  patches to be replaced on only a single section, one for lines to be
  replaced on a single section, and one for lines to be replaced on a
  single section.

  To specify a patch of points, start a new contour and place a point 
  inside of EVERY pixel in the patch.  Each separate patch should be 
  in a separate contour.  If the correction is to be made on only a
  single section, all of the points must lie on that section; but the
  points for a patch to be corrected on all sections can be on more 
  than one section, because sometimes they are more discernable on
  particular sections.
  
  To specify a line of points, make a contour with two points, at the
  start and end of the line to be replaced.  Lines must be horizontal
  or vertical.  Each pixel will be replaced by the average of the two
  pixels on either side of the line.  Put each line in a different
  contour.

  The inputs are:

  Input image file

  Output image file, or <Return> to place modified sections back into
  the input file.  USE REPLACEMENT OPTION WITH CAUTION

  Model file

  A list of objects which specify points or lines to be replaced on
  all sections, or / if all objects do so, or Return if none do.
  Ranges may be entered.

  A list of objects which specify lines to be replaced, or / if
  all objects do so, or Return if none do.  Ranges may be entered.

  Size of the border around the points in a patch, which contains the
  points which will be fit to (/ for default of 3 pixels)
  
  Order of polynomial (/ for default of 2, which includes terms in
  x, y, x**2, y**2 and x*y)

  0 to exclude or 1 to include points adjacent to the specified points
  in the polynomial fit.
