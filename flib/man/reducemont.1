  REDUCEMONT will reduce images in size by an integral factor (1, 2, 3,
  etc.) using simple averaging of blocks of pixels.  It will also 
  "recut" an image into different sized pieces.  Specifically, it can
  take either a whole or a montaged image as input and produce a whole
  or a montaged image as output, with the montage pieces of a desired
  size, and with a different total size if desired.  Header origin
  and scaling information are generated so that the new images will
  have the same coordinate system as the original images.  Thus,
  models will display properly on reduced image stacks.

  When you specify the maximum frame size and minimum overlap of the
  output image, the program will pick the largest frame size less than
  that maximum, with the smallest overlap greater than that minimum,
  so that the resulting image will contain at least as many pixels as
  the desired output image.  It picks a frame size that is a multiple
  of 2 and has no prime factor greater than 19 (so that fourier
  transforms can be run on the resulting pieces).

  Entries are as follows:

  Input image file
  Name of input file with list of piece coordinates, if image is a
  .  montage
  Output image file
  Name of new file for list of coordinates of pieces in the output file

  Data mode for output file (the default is same as mode of input)

  1 to float each section to maximum range for the data mode, 0 not to

  List of sections to be included in output file, or / to include all
  .  sections from the input file in the output file.  Ranges may be
  .  entered (e.g. 0-5,8-14,17-23)

  Reduction factor by which to reduce the size of the images

  Minimum and maximum X, and minimum and maximum Y coordinates that
  .	should be included from the input image.  Enter "/" to obtain
  .	the entire input image.

  Maximum limit on the X and Y frame size for output pieces, and
  .	minimum limit on overlap between output pieces.  The program
  .	will then choose new frame sizes and overlaps based on these
  .	limits

  0 to accept the program's choices of frame size and overlap.  When
  .	running interactively, entering 1 will allow you to loop back
  .	and enter new minimum and maximum X and Y coordinates and a
  .	new maximum frame and minimum overlap.  Note that on the first
  .     two entries, the program will enforce a minimum overlap of 2;
  .     if for some reason you want an overlap of 0, you need to loop
  .     back so that you enter the frame size and overlap 3 times.
