  BOXSTARTEND will extract subvolumes centered on the starting or ending
  points of model contours, or on all points in a model contour.  It can place
  each volume into a separate file, or stack all the extracted volumes into a
  single output file.  In the latter case, the program can generate two lists
  of piece coordinates to allow the volumes to be examined in two different
  ways in 3dmod(1).  One list will assemble all of the volumes into a single
  square array, with the extracted starting or ending points all appearing on
  the same section.  The other list will display each piece in its true
  position in the original volume of images.

  When all subvolumes are stacked in to a single file, an average will also be
  accumulated and saved in the file after the last extracted subvolume.  This
  average will show up as the rightmost item in the top row when viewing the
  square array in 3dmod(1).  If there is insufficient memory, the average will
  not be computed.

  The coordinates in the model are scaled to fit the current volume.  This
  means that you can model points in a binned-down volume and use that model
  directly to extract boxes from the full-sized volume.

  Boxstartend uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for pip(1))
  and can also still take input interactively.  The following options can be
  specified either as command line arguments (with the -) or one per line in a
  command file or parameter file (without the -):

INSERT OPTION TEXT HERE

  -StandardInput
     Read parameter entries from standard input.

  For compatibility with older command files, the program will also
  accept input interactively if started with no command line arguments.
  The interactive entries to the program are:
  
  Image file name
  Piece list file name, if image file is a montage
  Model file name
  
  0 to take the coordinates in the model as they are, or 1 to transform
      the coordinates by a set of transformations, or -1 to
      back-transform the coordinates.  The latter would be used to
      take coordinates from an aligned model and extract images from
      unaligned images.
  
  IF you entered -1 or 1 for transformed coordinates, next enter the
     name of the file with the transforms.  The first transform in the
     file should correspond to the first section in the file.

  Minimum and maximum X, and minimum and maximum Y index coordinates
     within which starting or ending points must be contained in order
     for them to be extracted, or / for no limits on coordinates
  
  Minimum and maximum section numbers within which the extracted
     volumes must be contained, or / for no limits on section number
  
  List of numbers of objects containing contours whose endpoints
     should be selected, or Return for all objects.  Ranges may be
     entered, e.g. 1-3,6.

  0 to extract starting points, or 1 to extract ending points, or -1
     to extract all points.
  
  Size of box, in pixels
  
  Number of sections before endpoint to extract, and number of
     sections after endpoint to extract
  
  0 to output all images into a single file, or 1 to output each
     box into a separate, numbered file
  
  IF you entered 1 for separate files, next enter the root name for the
     numbered files.  This is then the last entry.  IF you entered 0
     for a single file, then make the following additional entries:

  Name of output file for images

  Name of output file in which to place a list of piece coordinates in
     order to view the pieces in a square array, or Return for no
     file of such coordinates
  
  IF you specify a file name, next enter the amount of blank space to
     leave between adjacent pieces, in pixels
  
  Name of output file in which to place a list of the true, original
     coordinates of each piece, or Return for no such file
