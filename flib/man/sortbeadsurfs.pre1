  Subimage will subtract one image from another, or a series of images from one
  file from a series in another file.  It will report the minimum, maximum,
  mean, and standard deviation of each difference image.

  Subimage uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for pip(1))
  and can still take sequential input interactively.  The following options
  can be specified either as command line arguments (with the -) or one per
  line in a command file or parameter file (without the -):

  Sortbeadsurfs can be used to process two different kinds of models of the 3D
  positions of gold beads to make them suitable to use in Flattenwarp(1) for
  describing a surface to be flattened.  One kind of model would be of gold
  positions measured directly in the tomogram, such as by Findbeads3d(1).
  Here it is essential that if the beads are on two surfaces, each surface be
  represented by a separate object.  Sortbeadsurfs uses the same routine that
  Tiltalign(1) does to sort the beads into two objects.  The second kind of
  model is the one produced by Tiltalign(1) of the fiducial positions in 3D.
  Here it is essential that the model be tilted around the X axis by the X
  axis tilt used to generate the tomogram, that its coordinates be shifted if
  the aligned stack was made larger or smaller than the original stack, and
  that the points are in only one object for each surface.

  If you have a model from Findbead3d(1), you should first edit it to remove
  points that are obviously not on the surfaces.  Then run this program on the
  model.  Examine the output model to make sure points have been sorted
  correctly between the two surfaces.  If not, and if the failure is because
  the surface is too warped to analyze all at once, then try the -subarea
  option to analyze the beads in subareas.  If subareas are not suitable, you
  may have to edit the model to fix errors.  Each point in the output model is
  a separate contour, so it is possible to click on points with the third
  mouse button in the model view window to select them, and use the
  Edit_contour-Move dialog to move the points to the right object.

  If you have a model from Tiltalign(1), you should run this program on it to
  apply the X axis tilt that was used when generating the tomogram.  The
  program will attempt to sort the points into two surfaces, but if this
  creates a problem, use the -already option to skip the sorting.  If
  fiducials were tracked with multiple objects, the program automatically
  reduces them to one or two objects as appropriate.  If you changed the size
  of the aligned stack, use the -change option to adjust for this change.

  Sortbeadsurfs uses the PIP package for input exclusively (see the manual
  page for pip(1)).  The following options can be specified either as command
  line arguments (with the -) or one per line in a command file or parameter
  file (without the -):
