  Sortbeadsurfs can be used to process two different kinds of models of the 3D
  positions of gold beads to make them suitable to use in Flattenwarp(1) for
  describing a surface to be flattened.  One kind of model would be of gold
  positions measured directly in the tomogram, such as by Findbeads3d(1).
  Here it is essential that if the beads are on two surfaces, each surface be
  represented by a separate object.  Sortbeadsurfs uses the same routine that
  Tiltalign(1) does to sort the beads into two objects.  The second kind of
  model is the one produced by Tiltalign(1) of the fiducial positions in 3D.
  Here it is essential that the model be tilted around the X axis by the X
  axis tilt used to generate the tomogram, that its X and Y coordinates be
  shifted and/or scaled as appropriate to match the final tomogram, and that
  the points are in only one object for each surface.

  If you have a model from Findbead3d(1), you should first edit it to remove
  points that are obviously not on the surfaces.  (Flattenwarp has an option
  for removing more subtle outlying points, but it is best to get rid of the
  obvious points beforehand.)  Then run this program on the model.  Examine
  the output model to make sure points have been sorted correctly between the
  two surfaces.  If not, and if the failure is because the surface is too
  warped to analyze all at once, then try the -subarea option to analyze the
  beads in subareas.  If subareas are not suitable, you may have to edit the
  model to fix errors.  Each point in the output model is a separate contour,
  so it is possible to click on points with the third mouse button in the
  model view window to select them, and use the Edit_contour-Move dialog to
  move the points to the right object.

  If you have a model from Tiltalign(1), you should run this program on it to
  apply the X axis tilt that was used when generating the tomogram.  The
  program will attempt to sort the points into two surfaces, but if this
  creates a problem, use the -already option to skip the sorting.  If
  fiducials were tracked with multiple objects, the program automatically
  reduces them to one or two objects as appropriate.  The program has a host
  of options for adjusting for: a full aligned stack bigger or smaller than the
  original stack; binning of the prealigned stack or of the final aligned
  stack or tomogram; trimming of the tomogram in X or Y (or alternatively,
  generation of a tomogram that is a subarea in X and Y); or flipping by Y and
  Z rather than rotation around X in the trimming step.

  You should be able to load the resulting model on the tomogram to verify
  that it has the right coordinates.  To do so, be sure to use the -rescale
  option to account for any change in binning and to start 3dmod(1) with the
  -m option so that it ignores previous scale information in the model.  The
  points will not be on the right Z planes, so you will have to use the
  Edit-Model-Offsets dialog to shift the model in Z until it fits.

  Sortbeadsurfs uses the PIP package for input exclusively (see the manual
  page for pip(1)).  The following options can be specified either as command
  line arguments (with the -) or one per line in a command file or parameter
  file (without the -):
