  Subimage will subtract one image from another, or a series of images from one
  file from a series in another file.  It will report the minimum, maximum,
  mean, and standard deviation of each difference image.

  Subimage uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for pip(1))
  and can still take sequential input interactively.  The following options
  can be specified either as command line arguments (with the -) or one per
  line in a command file or parameter file (without the -):

INSERT OPTION TEXT HERE

  -StandardInput
     Read parameter entries from standard input.


  If there are no command-line arguments, Subimage takes sequential input
  the old way, with the following entries:

  Image file A

  List of section numbers for the images from file A; ranges may be entered,
       or / for all sections in the file

  Image file B, or a blank line to use the backup of file A (A~).

  List of corresponding section numbers for the images from file B; again,
        ranges may be entered, and / will sections from the beginning of the
        file

  Output file for difference A minus B, or a blank line for no output file,
        if only statistics are desired
