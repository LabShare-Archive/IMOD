  Idfprocess will do several simple operations on image distortion field
  files: it can compute the inverse of the fields in one file, or the 
  product or difference of fields in two files, and it can report 
  statistics on the vectors of each distortion field.

  If a product or difference is taken, two input files are required, but the
  output file is optional.  If an inverse is taken, only one input file is
  expected, and again the output file is optional.  In either case, if no
  output file is specified, the program will reports statistics on the output
  automatically.  If no operation is performed, statistics will be reported
  for the fields in the input file.

  For products and differences, if one file has one field and the other has
  more than one, the single field will be combined with each of the fields in
  the other file.  If both files have more than one field, there must be the
  same number of fields in both files, and corresponding pairs are combined to
  produce the same number of fields in the output.

  Idfprocess uses the PIP package for input exclusively (see the manual page
  for pip(1)).  The following options can be specified either as command line
  arguments (with the -) or one per line in a command file (without the -):
