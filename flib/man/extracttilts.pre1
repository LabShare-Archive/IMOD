  EXTRACTTILTS will extract one kind of information from the header of an
  image file, if it is present, and produce a file with a list of the values.
  The default behavior is to extract tilt angles; these can be extracted from
  headers in the Agard/FEI format or from headers produced by SerialEM.
  Enter an option to extract one of the other kinds of information written by
  SerialEM.

  In addition to extracting data stored in the image file header, the program
  can extract from a metadata file written by SerialEM in the autodoc format.
  A wider range of information can be stored in such a file than in the
  header.  The metadata file must have the same number of sections as the
  image file.

  Extracttilts uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for
  pip(1)). Thus, the following options can be specified either as command line
  arguments (with the -) or one per line in a command file (without the -):

INSERT OPTION TEXT HERE

  -StandardInput
     Read parameter entries from standard input.

  If the program is started with no command line arguments, it reverts to
  interactive input with the following entries:
  
  Image file with tilt information
  Output file for tilt angles, or Return to print to standard output
