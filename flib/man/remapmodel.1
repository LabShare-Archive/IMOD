  This program allows one to remap coordinates in a model,
  in two ways:
  1) The set of Z values may be mapped, one-to-one, to any arbitrary
  new set of Z values; and
  2) The X, Y or Z coordinates may be shifted by a constant.
  
  The mapping of Z values is done by first converting converting each Z
  value to the nearest integer, looking up the new integral Z value
  that you wish to map that integer to, then shifting the actual Z
  value by the difference betweenthe new and the original integral
  value.
  
  ENTRIES:
  
  Name of input model file
  
  Name of output model file
  
  New list of Z values.  Using ranges (e.g. 0-3,5-7), specify a list 
     of integers with the same number of Z values as in the input list.
     The Z values in the input list will be mapped one-to-one onto the
     new list.  Enter "/" to take the input list without modification.
     Enter numbers between -999 and -990 to delete points with a
     particular Z value; e.g. if the input model has Z values from 0
     to 9, entering 0-4,-999,5-8 will delete all points with Z between
     4.5 and 5.5, and shift the Z of points with Z greater then 5.5
     down by 1.  If the input model has Z from 0-19, entering
     0-9,-999--990 will remove all points with Z from 10 to 19.
     Enter -1 to replace each Z value by its negative.
  
  Amounts to add to all X, Y, and Z coordinates.  These values will be
     added after the remapping of Z values, if any.  Values should be
     in units of pixels (image index coordinates).
  
  IF your new list of Z values is not in monotonic order, enter 1 to
     have the program reorder the points within each object so that
     they occur with monotonically changing Z.  This option would be
     used if you wanted to switch two sections within a stack.
