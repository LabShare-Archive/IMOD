  Taperoutvol will cut a subset out of an image volume, pad it into a larger
  volume, and taper the intensity down to the mean value of the volume over
  the extent of the padding region, i.e., from the edge of the actual excised
  pixels to the edge of the new volume.  None of the original excised pixels
  are attenuated by this method.  The resulting volume will have dimensions
  suitable for taking the FFT unless the -nofft option is entered.

  Taperoutvol uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for pip(1))
  and can still take sequential input interactively, to maintain compatibility
  with old command files.  The following options can be specified either as
  command line arguments (with the -) or one per line in a command file or
  parameter file (without the -):

INSERT OPTION TEXT HERE

  -StandardInput
     Read parameter entries from standard input.


  If there are no command-line arguments, Taperoutvol takes sequential input
  the old way, with the following entries:
  
  Inputs to the program:
  
  Name of input file
  
  Name of output file
  
  The starting and ending X index coordinates (number from 0), the
  starting and ending Y index coordinates, and the starting and ending
  Z index coordinates to extract.  The default is the whole volume.
  
  The width of the borders, in X, Y, and Z, with which to pad the
  image block.  Borders will be made larger as necessary to make the
  output image size suitable for taking a 3D FFT, with the exception
  that if a single Z slice is requested with no padding, only a single
  slice is produced without padding.
  
  The program will stop with an error message if memory cannot be allocated
  for the output image, or if the subset is not entirely within the input 
  volume.
