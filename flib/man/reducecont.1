  This program will reduce the number of points in model contours to
  the minimum consistent with a defined maximum change in the model,
  the tolerance value.  Each of the original points in the model will
  be within the tolerance distance of the line segments connecting the
  final, reduced set of points.  Some smoothing is also done, and a
  point will be replaced by a smoothed point if the smoothed point is
  within the tolerance distance from the original point.
  
  Entries to the program:
  
  Name of input model file
  
  Name of output model file
  
  Number of points, and polynomial order, for the smoothing step.
  Values of 5 and 2 are recommended and are the defaults, accepted by
  entering /
  
  Tolerance value, or maximum change in the model, in pixels.
