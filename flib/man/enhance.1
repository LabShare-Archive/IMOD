 	  This is a two-dimensional gaussian bandpass filter
 	program for image enhancement purposes.
 	  For three-dimensional images, each image in the stack
 	is separately bandpass filtered.

 	  The filter is in the form of a gaussian highpass filter
 	given by:  (if Sigma1 is positive)
 	   (1. - exp(-r**2/(2*Sigma1**2)
 	multiplied by a gaussian-edged band-pass filter. This
 	filter is flat between Radius1 --> Radius2 and decays
 	symmetrically as a gaussian:
 	   exp(-(r-Radius)**2)/(2.*sigma2**2)

 	The units are in fractional reciprocal lattice units,
 	that is r goes from 0-->sqrt(2)   (0-->.5 on each axis)

 	If either Sigma = 0, then that part of the filter is removed!

 	If Sigma1 is negative, the first filter is second derivative
 	of a gaussian, Del-squared G, with formula
 	   r**2*exp(-r**2/(2.*Sigma1**2))
 	This filter alone is bandpass with a peak at 1.414*|Sigma1|, so
 	Sigma2 and the Radii can be set to zero

 	If Sigma2 is negative, the second filter is inverted (1 minus
 	the Gaussian band-pass filter).  This filter is then multiplied
 	by the filter specified by sigma1 (if any).

 	Several modes of operation are possible:

 	Gaussian low-pass filter (temperature factor)
 		:  Sigma1 & Radii = 0, use Sigma2

 	Gaussian bandpass centered at Radius
 		:  Sigma1=0, 		use Radius1=Radius2 & Sigma2

 	Gaussian-edged badpass between Radius1 & Radius2
 		:  Sigma1=0, 		use Radius1,Radius2 & Sigma2

 	Gaussian bandpass (low-pass + high-pass)
 		: Radii = 0,		use Sigma1 & Sigma2


 	Can now handle quite large images (8192 x 8192) using
 	the disk-based BIGFILT routine. The switch point is determined
 	by the current working set size.

        The program will accept file names either from the command line
        or as entries to the program after it is started.  If there are
        two names on the command line, they will be taken as the input
        and output file names; if there is one name, it will be taken
        as the input file name and the program will ask for the output
        file name; if there are no command line arguments, the program
        will ask for both input and output file names.

 	Input parameters are:

 	SIGMA1,SIGMA2,RADIUS1,RADIUS2
 				as described above

 	IORIG 			if IORIG = 1 then the F(0,0) is
 				unchanged by filter operation!!
