	  COMBINEFFT combines the FFTs from the two tomograms of a double-axis
	  tilt series, taking into account the tilt range of each tilt series
	  and the transformation used to match one tomogram to the other.  For
	  a location in Fourier space where there is data from one tilt series
	  but not the other, it takes the Fourier value from just the one
	  appropriate FFT; everywhere else it averages the Fourier values from
	  the two FFT files.
	  This program is a successor to Jim Kremer's ADDTOMFFT.
	  
	  Inputs to the program:
	  
	  File name of FFT of first tomogram (the one matched TO)
	  
	  File name of FFT of second tomogram (the one produced by MATCHVOL)
	  
          Name of output file for resulting FFT, or Return to write into the
              file of the second FFT, overwriting that FFT.
	  
	  Name of file with inverse of transformation used to match the two
	      tomograms (output by MATCHVOL)
	  
	  For the first tomogram file, either the starting and ending tilt
	     angles, or the name of a file with tilt angles in it.  In the
	     latter case, the first number on the first line will be taken as
	     the starting tilt angle; the first number on the last line will
	     be taken as the ending tilt angle.
	  
	  For the second tomogram file, either the starting and ending tilt
	     angles, or the name of a file with tilt angles in it.
