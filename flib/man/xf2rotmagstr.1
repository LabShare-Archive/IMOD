  xf2rotmagstr takes a file with a set of linear transformations expressed as
  2x2 matrices plus a shift in X and Ym and converts each 2x2 matrix to a
  rotation, magnification, and stretch along an axis.  The output appears as:

  1: rot=   11.80, mag= 1.0001, str= 0.9916 on   -4.9 axis, Mean mag= 0.9959

  where rot is rotation angle in degrees, mag is magnification factor, str is
  a stretch factor, the axis of the stretch is given in degrees of rotation
  from the X axis (counterclockwise positive).  Mean mag is the average size
  change with the stretch taken into account.  Rot, mag, and str match the
  values that would be shown if the transformations were read into midas(1).

  The format of each line of the transformation file is
     a11 a12 a21 a22 dx dy
  where the coordinate transformation is
     x' = a11 * x + a12 * y * dx
     y' = a21 * x + a22 * y * dx
