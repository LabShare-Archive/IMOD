  TOMOPIECES figures out how to chop up a tomogram into pieces so that
  the Fourier transforms of each piece can be done in memory.  It is
  meant to be called from the shell script SETUPCOMBINE.  It makes its
  decisions based on the maximum amount of memory that should be used
  for doing an FFT.
  
  Its one required input is the name of the tomogram file.  Optional
  inputs can follow this filename on the command line: the maximum
  memory to be used for FFTs (in bytes); the border size for padding
  (and tapering) for extracted pieces in X and Z; the border size for
  padding in Y; and the amount of overlap to generate between the
  extracted pieces.

  It outputs the number of pieces in X and Z, the index coordinates in
  X, Y, and Z required for extracting each piece with TAPEROUTVOL,
  and the index coordinates required for putting the pieces back
  together with ASSEMBLEVOL (first the X coordinates for each position
  in X, then the Y coordinates, then the Z coordinates for each
  position in Z).
