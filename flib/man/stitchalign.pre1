  Stitchalign computes an alignment between a montage of overlapping tomograms
  (referred to as a supermontage) so that they can be stitched into a single
  volume.  It does this using information about the local displacements in the
  overlap zones between each pair of adjacent volumes, i.e., the patch vectors
  produced by Corrsearch3d(1).  It also uses values for the overall
  displacements between the volumes computed by Edgepatches(1) and stored in
  the supermontage info file.

  The first step is to compute a single rotation in the X/Y plane, and overall
  shifts of the volumes, that would bring their centers onto a regular
  rectangular grid.  This rotation can compensate for the effects of the tilt
  axis not being perpendicular in the original images.  Specifically, if the
  data were acquired on a regular grid of positions in the camera coordinate
  system, the reconstructions end up being staggered from one another by the
  rotation of the tilt axis to the vertical, and this rotation will correct
  for the staggering.  If the value found is not appropriate, there is an
  option to supply a specific value instead.  In addition, if the angle
  between the pieces is not related to this tilt axis effect, you might want
  to prevent rotation entirely.

  The next step is to compute a set of single transformations, one per volume,
  that best aligns the volumes.  The parameters available for alignment are
  rotation about the three axes (referred to as alpha, beta, and gamma), an
  overall size change (referred to as magnification), stretch along one axis
  in the X/Y plane (expressed as stretch of the Y axis relative to the X axis
  and rotation of the Y axis relative to the X axis), and a thinning factor in
  the Z dimension.  Any subset of the parameters can be selected; the
  rotations are included by default and there is one option to exclude one or
  more of them; there are three separate options for including the
  magnification, stretch, and thinning.  The parameters are found using the
  same variable metric minimization routine used by Tiltalign(1).  The program
  can do a single search that includes the parameters for all volumes at once,
  but this turns out not to work, apparently because of multiple minima
  produced by competing alignments between different pairs of valumes.  Thus,
  the program will do a separate search for each pair of overlapping volumes,
  then resolve the relative alignment parameters between pairs of volumes into
  a set of parameters for the individual volumes.

  These single transformations may leave substantial misalignments in the
  overlap zones.  The final step uses the remaining local displacements in the
  overlap zones to compute the amount that each volume needs to be displaced
  locally to bring it into alignment with an adjacent volume (which is also
  being displaced locally).  The result is a set of patch vectors for each
  volume, which Findwarp(1) can use to find a series of transformations for
  warping each volume into the final alignment.  By default, these vectors are
  produced on a finer grid than the original patch vectors for the overlap
  zones.  This oversampling may not be necessary if the original vectors are
  relatively finely spaced; it can be controlled by the -spacing option.
  Tomostitch(1) takes this spacing factor into account when running
  Findwarp(1) so that the local fits will require about the same amount of
  original data as if the spacing were unchanged.

  Within this program, there is no local fitting to patch vectors in order to
  determine the quality of fit and to identify aberrant displacements.  Bad
  vectors in the input files will generally produce bad warping vectors that
  are hard to eliminate.  It is thus critical to get as reliable a set of
  patch vectors from Edgepatches(1) as possible, to use Fitpatches(1) to
  assess the quality of fit and provide local fitting information for
  Stitchalign, and to manually remove aberrant vectors from patch models where
  necessary.  Stitchalign will use the output from Fitpatches(1) in several
  ways.  It will read all available patch vector files for an overlap zone:
  the original patch vectors, the "reduced" patch vectors with correlation
  coefficients produced by removing the large linear component from the patch
  vectors, and the patch vectors that have been passed through Findwarp(1) to
  obtain residual and outlier information.  A vector will be eliminated from
  the analysis if it is not still present in all available patch files; thus,
  you can edit whichever patch model you prefer.  A vector will be eliminated
  if the fraction of times it has been removed from Findwarp(1) fits as an
  outlier exceeds a criterion.  Vectors with high residuals can also be
  eliminated based on a criterion, but this does not happen by default because
  it is hard to set a default criterion.

  You can run the alignment on subsets of the data either for experimentation
  or if that subset is going to be stitched.  Ultimately, all of the volumes
  to be stitched must be included in one run of the program - it is not
  possible to run one subset with one set of parameters and another subset
  with other parameters then combine those results into a single alignment.

  The size of the volumes to be stitched together by Tomostitch(1) is set when
  Stitchalign is run.  The default is the largest size of the input volumes,
  but it can be controlled with the -size parameter.  If oversized tomograms
  were generated to retain data that would otherwise be lost because of the
  tilt axis rotation, then this is the point at which a size close to that of
  the original data can be specified.

  Stitchalign uses the PIP package for input exclusively (see the manual
  page for pip(1)).  The following options can be specified either as command
  line arguments (with the -) or one per line in a command file or parameter
  file (without the -).  Options can be abbreviated to unique letters; the
  currently valid abbreviations for short names are shown in parentheses.
