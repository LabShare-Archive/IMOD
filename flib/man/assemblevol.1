  Assemblevol will assemble a single MRC file from separate files that form an
  array of subvolumes in X, Y, and Z.  In effect, it can take montaged images
  and compose them into single images, just as Reducemont(1) can, but its
  advantage is that it can take the images from multiple files.  Its primary
  use is for reassembling a tomogram after it has been chopped into pieces,
  using the coordinates output by Tomopieces(1).  A second use to concatenate
  reprojections computed in parallel by Tilt(1).
  
  Inputs to the program:
  
  Name of output file for the assembled volume
  
  Number of input files in the X, Y and Z dimensions
  
  For each position in X, enter a line with the starting and ending X index
  coordinates (numbered from 0) to be extracted from the files at that
  position.  These coordinates should be chosen to eliminate any overlap
  between the files at successive positions.  For example, if there are
  two files in X, each 1000 pixels wide, and they overlap by 20 pixels, you
  would enter 0,989 and 10,999.  If there is no overlap between any of the
  files in X, you can enter 0,0 for each position, but you can not enter 0,0
  for some positions and actual coordinates for others.

  Similarly, for each position in Y, enter a line with starting and ending Y
  index coordinates to be extracted from files at that position.  Again, if
  there is no overlap between any of the files in Y, you can enter 0,0 for
  each position.

  For each position in Z, enter a line with starting and ending Z index
  coordinates to be extracted from files at that position.  If there is no
  overlap between any of the files in Y, you can enter 0,0 for each position.

  The input file names, one per line, in order by increasing X, then
  increasing Y, then increasing Z.  For example, if there are files only in X
  and Z, enter all of the files in the first row in Z in order by increasing
  X, then the files in the second row, etc.
