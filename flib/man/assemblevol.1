  Assemblevol will assemble a single MRC file from separate files
  that form an array of subvolumes in X, Y, and Z.  In effect, it can
  take montaged images and compose them into single images, just as
  Reducemont can, but its advantage is that it can take the images
  from multiple files.  Its primary use is for reassembling a tomogram
  after it has been chopped into pieces, using the coordinates output
  by Tomopieces.
  
  Inputs to the program:
  
  Name of output file for the assembled volume
  
  Number of input files in the X, Y and Z dimensions
  
  For each position in X, enter a line with the starting and ending X
  index coordinates (numbered from 0) to be extracted from the files
  at that position.  There should be no overlap between the pixels
  extracted from files at successive positions.
  
  Similarly, for each position in Y, enter a line with starting and
  ending Y index coordinates to be extracted from files at that
  position.

  For each position in Z, enter a line with starting and ending Z
  index coordinates to be extracted from files at that position.

  The input file names, one per line, in order by increasing X,
  then increasing Y, then increasing Z.  For example, if there are
  files only in X and Z, enter all of the files in the first row in
  Z in order by increasing X, then the files in the second row, etc.
