  This program will reduce the number of points in model contours to
  the minimum consistent with a defined maximum change in the model,
  the tolerance value.  Each of the original points in the model, including
  the ones that are removed, will be within the tolerance distance of the line
  segments connecting the final, reduced set of points.  Some smoothing is
  also done, and a point will be replaced by a smoothed point if the smoothed
  point is within the tolerance distance from the original point.
  
  Reducecont uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for pip(1)).
  The following options can be specified either as command line arguments
  (with the -) or one per line in a command file or parameter file (without
  the -):
