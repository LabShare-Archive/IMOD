  IMAVGSTAT generates statistics on the mean and standard deviation
  of image density in selected areas of images that are obtained by
  averaging multiple samples.  It can also produce a new set of
  averaged images that are all normalized to have the same average
  density in specified reference areas.  A set of images showing the
  standard deviation at each pixel may also be produced and used for
  statistical analysis by other programs such as SUBIMSTAT.
  Typically, the program would be used to compare averages of
  different sample sets.
  
  Before running the program, one uses IMOD to construct a model in
  which each contour specifies a "summing region".  A summing region
  may be defined by either 2 points or 4 or more points.  Four points
  define a quadrilateral summing region (a 5th point to make the model
  contour look like a quadrilateral is optional and is ignored by the
  program). Two points define a line; the actual extent of the summing
  region perpendicular to this line is specified when one runs the
  program. This model should be built on an image stack in which all
  of the images being compared are aligned.  More than 4 points can be
  used to specify a region of complex shape.
  
  The summing regions are used in the program in two different ways: to
  specify the low and high density normalizing areas, and to specify
  the summing areas, areas that are being compared between images.
  
  The normalizing areas are used to scale the averages from all of the
  different sample sets so that the mean density in the low area is 0
  and the mean density in the high area is 100.  Each of these two
  areas may be a combination of more than one summing region.  However,
  all of the regions used to specify a low or high normalizing area
  must be described by contours of at least 4 points.  If you do not
  want the densities normalized, enter one contour for the low
  normalizing area and the same contour for the high normalizing area.
  In this case, average densities will have the same scaling as the
  original data.
  
  Summing areas may be whole summing regions or subdivisions of summing
  regions.  When running the program, one specifies the number of
  summing areas that each region should be divided into.  If a region
  is a quadrilateral, it will be divided into areas by lines parallel
  to the short axis of the quadrilateral.  A region specified by 2
  points will be divided into areas at points equally spaced along the
  line connecting the two points.  The shape of those areas is
  specified by a single parameter: 0 for circular areas; 1 for square
  areas with edges parallel and perpendicular to the connecting line;
  or, for rectangular areas, the ratio of width to height (height being
  the dimension parallel to the connecting line).  If you want to
  divide up a region with more than 5 points, then you must trace the
  region in a special way.  Start at one end of the region and trace
  one side along the long axis, with as many points as needed to define
  the region adequately.  At the other end, add a single line segment
  to describe that end, then trace back along the other long side,
  with the same number of points as on the first long side, and with
  each point opposite the corresponding point on the other side.  Both
  short ends must thus be decsribed by a single line segment.
  
  You can divide a region into areas by specifying either the number
  of areas to divide it into, or the desired width (in pixels) of each
  of the subdivisions.  In the latter case, you enter the negative of
  the width in pixels.

  The program has an option to produce an image file with different
  colored pixels for each summing area; one can use this while
  learning how to produce summing regions at desired locations.
  
  The program can compute statistics and averages from unaligned
  samples within each data set, applying any needed transformations in
  a single step rather than in the 2 or 3 steps that would ordinarily
  be used to get a series of aligned averages.  The averages produced
  by this program might thus be superior in quality or appearance.  For
  each data set, one can specify 1 or 2 sets of transforms that are
  needed to align all of the samples within the data set.  If multiple
  data sets are being used (or if the summing region model is built on
  an average that was transformed to align with other averages), then
  one must specify in addition the G transform applied to the average
  to align each data set with other averages or with the model.
  
  The program requests numerous entries of "lists", in which "ranges
  are OK".  In such a list, a range is specified by 2 numbers separated
  by a dash, and ranges or individual values are separated by commas.
  For example, 2-4,7,9,11-14 specifies the list 2,3,4,7,9,11,12,13,14
  When you put entries into a command file, you may put text after a
  list. 
  
  The program allows you to append its output to a set of existing
  files from a previous run of the program.  If you elect to append,
  then the files (statistics output, average image, and standard
  deviation image) will first be copied to new versions, then output
  will be appended to those new files.  If the program crashes, the
  previous versions will be intact, but you must be careful to delete
  any new, incorrect versions of the files before trying to run the
  program again.  Be sure NOT TO PURGE before doing this.

  Entries to the program:
  
  0 to place output in new files, or 1 to append to existing files.

  Name of model file defining summing regions, or Return if no
     summing or normalizing is desired
  
  Name of file of G transforms used to align averages from different
     data sets to each other.  Enter Return if no G transforms.
  
  Name of file to output the statistics into, or Return for no output.
     This file is readable, but is meant to be run into AVGSTATPLOT
  
  Name of file to place new average images into, or Return for none
  
  Name of file to place standard deviation images into, or Return
     for none
  	  
  IF you did not enter a model file with summing areas, skip the next
     6 entries and go right to entering NX and NY:

  Name of file for a map of the pixels in the summing areas, or Return
     for none.
  
  List of contours that comprise the LOW density normalizing area.
     Here and in the next two entries, enter a series of pairs of
     numbers, all on one line.  The pair is either an IMOD object
     number and contour number, or a WIMP object number and 0.
  
  List of contours that comprise the HIGH density normalizing area.
     To avoid normalization, enter the same contour as low and high
     normalizing area.
  
  List of contours specifying the summing regions.
  
  Number of summing areas in each of the regions just specified, or the
     negative of the width (in pixels) of the areas that you want the
     region divided into.  (You must enter one value per region.)
  
  0 for circles, 1 for squares, or ratio of width to length for
     rectangles.  You must enter one value per region; just enter 0 for
     regions specified by 4 or more points.
  
  Horizontal and vertical pixel dimensions of the image file (NX and
     NY).
  
  Number of data sets to analyse and compare
  
  Number of subsets of positions to average for each data set.  Enter /
     if you do not want to do subsets of positions; otherwise enter a
     number for each data set (use zero for no subsets for a particular
     set.)
  
  --- The rest of the entries are required for each data set in turn:
  
  Name of image file containing stack of samples to be averaged
  
  List of section numbers to "try" to include in the averaging,
     or / for all sections.  Ranges may be entered.
  
  Number of sets of F transforms to apply to the samples before
     averaging.  Enter 0, 1 or 2; do not count the G transforms
     specified above.
  
  IF you specified 1 or 2 sets of F's, next enter the name of the only
     or first file of F transforms
  
  IF you specified 2 sets of F's, next enter the name of the second
     file of F transforms
  
  IF you specified any F's, next enter the offset to add to the section
     number to obtain the line number of the corresponding transform in
     the file of F's.  Both line and section numbers start at 0.
     If alignment routines have been used properly, an entry of 0 will
     suffice.
  
  IF you specified a file of G transforms to align different sets to
     each other, next enter the line number of the G transform for this
     data set.  The first line is number 0.
  
  IF you specified that you wanted to average subsets of positions for
  this data set, next make the following entries:
  
      Name of file with list of position numbers for each section, as
         produced by EXTPOSITION
  
      For each subset, enter a list of position numbers to include in
         the average.  Enter each list on a separate line.
  
  Enter 1 to set cutoffs for elimination of outliers, -1 for automatic
     selection of cutoffs, or 0 to skip this option.  If you do select
     this option, the program enters a loop (with entries described
     below) in which it repeatedly comes back to this point until you
     enter a 0.
  
  --- An entry of 0 at the last step completes the entries for a data
  --- set; you then enter all parameters for the next data set, etc.
  
  The last option allows you to interactively eliminate "outliers",
  sections that deviate the most from the average in the low and/or
  high normalizing areas or in the difference between high and low
  areas.  This option should be used only if one has a specific basis
  for thinking that some subset of sections are significantly poorer
  than the rest.  Otherwise, it is strongly recommended that you skip
  through this option by entering 0.
  
  Outliers can be eliminated based one whether their low normalizing
  area is more than a criterion number of standard deviations away from
  the mean for all samples, or on whether the high normalizing area
  deviates from the mean by more than a separate criterion, or on
  whether the difference between high and low areas deviates by more
  than yet another criterion.  If one enters a criterion of zero for
  one of these 3 deviations, that deviation will not be considered.
  One may elect to eliminate outliers only if all deviations being
  considered are above their respective criteria, or if any of those
  deviations are above criterion.
  
  If you do select manual elimination of outliers (with an entry of 1),
  then there two entries:
  
  Criterion number of S.D.'s for deviation from mean of low area, of
     high area, and of difference between low and high areas.  The
     default is 2,2,2.
  
  0 to eliminate a section if any of deviations being considered are
     over criterion, or 1 to eliminate only if all deviations are over.
  
  If you select automatic elimination of outliers with an entry of -1,
  then there are no further entries.  The program will then attempt to
  find the outlier elimination that minimizes the sum of the standard
  errors of the mean of all of SUMMING (not normalizing) areas.  It
  does this by repeatedly scaling the last-entered values of the three
  criteria (or the default values, if none were entered) by a common
  factor until it finds the scaling that minimizes the sum of SEM's.
