  EXTRACTPIECES will extract piece coordinates from the header of
  an image file, if they are present, and produce a file with those
  coordinates (a piece list file).

  The Unix version will take the file names either on the command line
  or as entries to the program.  If there are no file names on the
  command line, the program asks for both the input and output file
  names.  If there is one file name on the command line, the program
  takes that as the input file and asks for the output file name.

  Entries to program:
  
  Image file
  Output file for piece coordinates
