  Corrsearch3d will determine the 3D displacement between two image
  volumes at a regular array of positions.  At each position, it extracts
  a patch of a specified size from each volume, then searches for a local
  maximum in the cross-correlation between the two patches, computing
  correlations in real space at each displacement between the patches.  
  The starting point of the search is based upon the displacements of
  adjacent patches that have already been determined.  If there are no
  such adjacent patches, or if no maximum is found for displacements
  within a specified range, the program uses FFT-based cross-correlation
  instead of real-space correlation.  The program works from the center
  of the volume outward, analyzing patches in the X direction, then in
  the shorter of Y and Z dimensions, then in the longer of those
  dimensions.  An optional model file can be entered with contours
  enclosing the area where patches should be analyzed; patches outside
  this area are excluded.  Information about the source volume for the
  file being transformed can be entered so that the program can analyze
  patches only from regions that are good in the second image file.  In
  addition, a model can be provided enclosing good areas in the source
  for the second file.

  The data being correlated can be filtered by convolving with a 3x3x3 or
  5x5x5 Gaussian kernel in real space.  This smoothing is applied to one
  of the two patches before correlating them.  The degree of filtering is
  controlled by the sigma (standard deviation) of the Gaussian, which
  should be a small number on the order of 1.  Computation time will
  increase by ~30% when smoothing with a 3x3x3 kernel and it will double
  with a 5x5x5 kernel.  By default, the program will select a 3x3x3
  kernel for sigma less than 1.5 and a 5x5x5 kernel for larger sigmas,
  unless the size is explicitly selected.  The useful range of sigma is
  probably 0.5 to 3.

  Low and high frequency filtering can also be applied in Fourier space,
  but this is useful only for testing because it is used only with the
  rare FFT-based correlations.

  The program works with files whose thin dimension is in either Y or Z.
  If the volumes are offset from each other (such as adjacent tomograms),
  this offset can be specified with the -InitialShiftXYZ option.  The
  displacements computed by the program are in addition to this global
  shift.

  The program outputs an initial line with the total number of
  patches, then one line for each patch, containing the X, Y, and Z
  coordinates of the patch, the displacement between the two files
  in X, Y, and Z, and the correlation coefficient.

  Corrsearch3d uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for pip(1))
  and can take input interactively for options that existed when it was
  converted, to maintain compatibility with patchcrawl3d(1).  The
  following options can be specified either as command line arguments (with
  the -) or one per line in a command file or parameter file (without 
  the -).  Options can be abbreviated to unique letters; the currently valid
  abbreviations for short names are shown in parentheses.

  -StandardInput
     Read parameter entries from standard input.


  If the program is started with no command line arguments, it reverts to
  interactive input with the following entries:
  
  Name of reference image file being aligned to
  
  Name of image file that will be transformed to match
  
  Name of output file for patch positions and displacements
  
  Name of a temporary file for output from onepatchcorr
  
  Name of a model file with contours that enclose the areas where
  patches should be analyzed, or Return to analyze patches at all
  locations
  
  Size of patches in X, Y and Z
  
  Number of patches in the X, Y and Z directions
  
  Size of borders to be excluded on the lower and upper sides in X,
  the lower and upper sides in Y, and the lower and upper sides in Z
  
  Number of pixels over which to taper the patches in X, Y and Z
  
  Maximum displacement to determine by searching
  
  Either the X, Y, and Z size or the name of the original source
  volume for the second image file.  Return to omit analysis of
  positions in this file.
  
  Name of the 3-D transformation file used to generate the second
  image file from its source volume, or Return to omit analysis of
  positions in the second file.
  
  Size of borders to be excluded on the lower and upper sides in X
  and the lower and upper sides in Z in the original source volume
  for the second image file.

  Written by David Mastronarde  7/16/01
  7/20/02: Added analysis of areas to exclude based on positions in the
	source for the second volume
  8/16/06: Converted to PIP, incorporated FFT correlations internally,
        added filtering, made it extract the B patches based on the local
        shift instead of using the same coordinates in both volumes,
        added model file for B and initial displacement, handled volumes
        in both orientations.
