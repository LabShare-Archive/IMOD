  ADDTOSTACK will append sections from one or more files to an
  existing image file.  The X and Y dimensions of all files must match.
  All sections will be appended from the files that are being added.
  No image transformation or scaling is performed.  The header of the
  resulting image file will be set to give "pixel spacing" of 1 (grid
  and cell sizes equal to image size).
  
  There is one option: whether or not to make a copy of the existing
  file before adding sections to it.  If you elect to make a copy,
  this will take some extra time and will require the disk space to
  hold 2 copies of the file.  You will then be able to examine the new
  file to see if it meets your expectations before deleting the old
  file with a purge command.  If you do not make a copy, the program
  will run quicker and less disk space will be required, but it is
  conceivable that the file will become unusable if certain types of
  errors occur.  (If you specify a non-existent file or one of the
  wrong size, or if there is an error reading one of the files, the
  file being appended to will NOT become unusable.)
  
  Entries to the program:
  
  Name of file to append to
  
  0 to append to existing file, or 1 to make new copy and append to it
  
  Number of files to append to the file
  
  Names of these files, one per line
