  Densnorm can normalize images by dividing by the incident illumination, an
  operation usually referred to as mass normalization.  It can take the log of
  normalized data, or simply take the log of the input data.  It can also
  output weighting factors that can be supplied to Tilt(1) to provide a
  relative normalization of the data, thus avoiding the need to write a
  normalized file.

  Mass normalization is done in order to bring different images to a common
  scale so that they all represent projections of the same structure.  That
  way, images at different angles will be appropriately weighted in a
  backprojection.  A relative normalization, where images are just adjusted for
  different exposures, is sufficient for this purpose.  An absolute
  normalization is useful if one wants images that are proportional to the sum
  of the mass densities in the specimen, with no additive constants.  Absolute
  normalization requires information about the image intensity that would be
  produced by the unattenuated beam.  With this information, the program can
  compute a transmittance value, I/I0, where I is the image intensity at each
  pixel and I0 is the intensity produced by the unattenuated beam.

  The treatment of transmittance values depends on whether the log is going to
  be taken of the data.  This choice would depend on the source of contrast.
  For stained samples where amplitude contrast dominates, the projected mass
  density should be proportion to the negative of the log of the
  transmittance.  In this case, taking the log of the transmittance is
  appropriate and will result in negative values, where 0 corresponds to 0
  projected mass.  When phase contrast dominates, it seems that the amount of
  attenuation of the beam should be proportional to the linear sum of mass
  densities.  Here, it should be appropriate not to take the log.  Thus, when
  the log is not being taken, the program will express the densities as
  attenuations by taking one minus the transmittance (1 - I/I0).  These
  attenuations will also be negative numbers, with 0 corresponding to 0 mass.
  In either case, you can convert the negative values to positive ones, but
  this will reverse the contrast of the data and make density appear white.

  Standard R-weighted backprojection as implemented in Tilt(1) is insensitive
  to the mean value of images, and there is no value in having an absolute
  normalization.  On the other hand, having density values where 0 means 0
  mass is potentially important for algebraic reconstruction techniques, where
  it is possible to constrain values to be all positive or all negative.
  These considerations motivate the following recommendations for various
  cases:

  1) R-weighted back projection when taking the log: Do not bother to normalize
  the data; it should have no effect.

  2) R-weighted back projection when not taking the log: A relative
  normalization is sufficient; use this program either to normalize the data
  or to compute weighting factors to pass to Tilt(1).

  3) Algebraic technique without zero constraints, and taking the log:
  Normalization is unnecessary but use this program to take the log before
  starting the reconstruction procedure.

  4) Algebraic technique without zero constraints, and without taking the
  log: A relative normalization is sufficient; as in 2), either normalize the
  data or pass weighting factors to Tilt(1) (assuming Tilt(1) will be involved
  in the algebraic technique).

  5) Algebraic technique with zero constraints, and taking the log: An
  absolute normalization is needed, using reference image data; take the log
  after normalizing.

  6) Algebraic technique with zero constraints, and without taking the log: An
  absolute normalization is needed.

  Densnorm uses the PIP package for input exclusively (see the manual page for
  pip(1)).  The following options can be specified either as command line
  arguments (with the -) or one per line in a command file or parameter file
  (without the -).  Options can be abbreviated to unique letters; the
  currently valid abbreviations for short names are shown in parentheses.
