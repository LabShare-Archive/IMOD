  Fiberpitch measures the angle of fibers relative to a central axis
  and their distance from the axis.  The pitch is resolved into radial
  and tangential components.  Several fiber bundles in a model may be
  analyzed separately by drawing contours around them.  The central
  axis may be specified by a model contour; otherwise it will be
  assumed to be located at the centroid of the fibers and oriented
  either vertically or along the average trajectory of the fibers.
  Measurements can be made from fibers in a subset of the model
  in Z.  The program can analyze several models and output the results
  to a single file. 

  To use the program, the fibers should be modeled as open contours in
  an Imod model.  These contours can be in more than one object. The
  pitch for a fiber will be measured from the vector connecting the
  starting and ending points of the contour.  The position of the fiber
  is characterized by a single point for the purposes of measuring the
  distance from the central axis, resolving the pitch into radial
  and tangential components, and determining whether a fiber is a
  member of a bundle.  This point can be either the starting point,
  ending point, or middle of the contour; the same kind of point is
  used for every contour in an object.  If the middle is chosen, the
  program finds the point in the contour that is halfway along the
  length of the contour between the starting and ending points.  If a
  subset of Z is chosen for analysis, then the starting and ending
  points for all of these purposes are the first and last points inside
  the specified Z range, respectively.
  
  If separate bundles are to be analyzed, include an object with
  separate closed contours that surround the fibers in each bundle.
  These contours should be drawn in an X/Y plane and may be drawn at
  any desired Z-level.  The X and Y coordinates of the characteristic
  point for each contour are used to determine whether it is inside a
  given boundary contour.
  
  To define the central axes of bundles, include another object with
  open contours that describe the trajectories of the axes.  Only two
  points are needed for each axis.  The first point should be placed
  at about the same Z level as the characteristic points for the
  fibers.  The direction in Z will affect the angles and should be
  chosen appropriately (see below).  If no central axis object is
  used, or if there is no central axis contour inside the contour
  specifying a particular bundle, then the program will assume that
  the axis for that bundle is  located at the centroid of the
  characteristic points for all of the fibers in that bundle.  You can
  specify that such an axis will follow the mean trajectories of the
  fibers; otherwise it will be made perpendicular to the X/Y plane.
  
  The program includes in its output an identifying number for the 
  model (optional), the contour number of the boundary contour
  (optional), the object and contour number of the fiber, the X and Y
  coordinates of the characteristic point relative to the central axis
  (in a coordinate system achieved after rotating the axis to
  vertical), the distance from the axis to the characteristic point,
  the angle between the fiber and axis, and the radial and tangential
  components of the pitch.  The coordinates and distance will be in
  nanometers, or in pixels if there is no scale in the model header.
  The overall angle varies from 0 to 180  degrees and will depend on
  the direction of the central axis as well as that of the fiber.  It
  is greater than 90 degrees if the fiber forms an oblique angle with
  the axis, with these directions taken into account.  The radial
  pitch varies from -180 to 180 degrees; it is positive if the fiber
  is heading away from the axis and negative if the fiber is heading
  toward it; its magnitude is greater than 90 the the angle to the
  axis is oblique.  The tangential pitch varies from -90 to 90 degrees
  and is positive or negative depending on whether the fiber follows a
  right-handed or lefted-handed screw thread around the axis.  The
  program allows options to invert the polarity of all the fibers in
  an object, and to invert the polarity of the axis marker for a
  particular object, so that these angles can all be made to come out
  right even if fibers or the axis marker are not modeled in the right
  polarity for a particular object.  When an axis is derived from the
  mean trajectory of fibers that have mixed polarities, the polarity
  of the axis is determined by which polarity is predominant among the
  fibers.
  
  The first three entries to the program apply to the output for all
  of the following models:
  
  Name of output file, or Return to output to the terminal or log file.
  
  1 to output an identifying number for each model, or 0 not to.
  
  1 to output boundary contour numbers, or 0 not 0.
  
  The following entries are made for each model to be processed:
  
  Name of model file, or Return to exit the program.
  
  IF you entered 1 above to output identifying numbers, then enter
  the identifying number for this model; otherwise skip this entry.
  
  Lower and upper Z levels within which to measure pitches, or 0,0
  to have no constraints in Z.

  List of objects with fibers to analyze.  Ranges may be entered, e.g.,
  1-3,5,8.
  
  For each object to be analyzed, enter -1, 0, or 1 to take the
  characteristic point for measuring fiber position to be at the start,
  middle, or end of the contour, respectively.
  
  For each object to be analyzed, enter 1 to invert the polarity of
  fibers and compute their direction using the vector from the end to
  the start, or 0 to use the normal polarity from start to end.
  
  For each object to be analyzed, enter 1 to invert the polarity of 
  the central axis, or 0 not to.
  
  Object number of object containing boundary contours around bundles
  of fibers, or 0 to treat all fibers as belonging to one bundle.
  
  Object number of object containing contours marking the central axes,
  or 0 to use a vertical axis through the centroid of the fiber
  positions in X and Y, or -1 to use an axis that follows the mean
  trajectory of the fibers.
