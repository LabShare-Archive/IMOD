  JOINMODEL will combine two models, joining objects in the
  SECOND model to the ends of objects in the FIRST model, if the
  corresponding points match up sufficiently well.  Branch points are
  allowed in either model, and should be preserved even during joining
  of objects.  Point "marks" (numbers controlling point symbol
  display), which are properties of individual points in the model,
  will be preserved, but text labels in the second model will not.

  Objects will be joined together only if there is physical
  overlap between the end of the object in the FIRST model and the
  start of the object in the SECOND model.  If an object in the FIRST
  model ends on one section and an object in the SECOND model starts
  in the same location on the next section, they will not be joined.
  
  When two objects are joined together, the points in the object in the
  SECOND model that overlap will be thrown away, and the rest of the
  points in that object will be added to the end of the object in the
  FIRST model.  The resulting object will have the same color and
  other attributes as the original object in the FIRST model.  All
  other objects will be carried over into the joined model without
  modification.
  
  Entries to the program:
  
  Name of SECOND model file (YES, it needs the SECOND one first).
  Name of FIRST model file
  Name of output model file
  
  Maximum distance in the X-Y plane, and maximum separation in Z,
     allowed in order for points from the two different models to be
     considered matching points.  Enter / to accept the default values
     in brackets.
  
  Maximum overlap to look for between objects in the two models.
     Enter / to accept the default value in brackets.  This parameter
     controls how long it takes the program to look for matches.
  
  
  The program considers the end point of each object in the FIRST
  model in turn.  It looks for a match between that end point and the
  first, second, etc. point of each object in the SECOND model
  (up to the number specified by the maximum overlap parameter).  When
  it finds a match, it then tests whether each of the points from the
  beginning of the object in the SECOND model up to that matching point
  also match the corresponding points in the object in the FIRST model.
  Only if there is a complete match along the entire stretch of overlap
  will the objects be joined.
