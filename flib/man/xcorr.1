	xcorr - to cross-correlate a single image with a whole image stack

 	  XCORR cross-correlates each of the sections in one image stack with
 	  a single section in a second image file.  A subset of sections may
 	  be done.  Either or both of the input sections may be filtered before
 	  the correlation, and the resulting correlation may also be filtered.
 	  (Note that if you are applying only a single filter, the result will
 	  be the same regardless of where the filter is applied.)
 	  The single image may be smaller than the images in the stack.  In
 	  this case, the single image will be placed in an array of the larger
 	  size, with the MIDDLE of the smaller image moved to the LOWER-LEFT
 	  corner of the larger array.  As a consequence of this shift,
 	  the coordinates of the peaks in the correlation will
 	  correspond to the coordinates of the centers of features in the image
 	  stack that best match the single image.  If the single image and
 	  stack have the same dimensions, then you have a choice as to whether
 	  to keep the single image as it is or to move its middle into the
 	  lower left corner.  Displacements between images would then be
 	  reflected by the positions of peaks in the correlogram relative to
 	  the (0,0) pixel (if the image is not shifted) or relative to the
 	  middle (NX/2,NY/2) pixel (if the image is shifted.)
 	  
 	  Entries in order are:
 	  
 	  Stack input file
 	  Single image input file
 	  Correlation output file
 	  
 	  Starting and ending section #'s (first is 0), or / for all sections
 	  
 	  Filter parameters to prefilter images in stack, or / for no filter
 	  Filter parameters to prefilter the single image, or / for no filter
 	  Filter parameters to postfilter the correlation, or / for no filter
 	  .    (Enter values of Sigma1, Sigma2, Radius1, Radius2 just as for
 	  .       ENHANCE or VIEWFILT)
 	  
	  IF the single image is smaller than the images in the stack, then
	  enter 1 to shift the center of the single image to the lower left
	  corner, or 0 not to.
