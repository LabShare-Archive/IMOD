	BSPLT - an interactive 2-D plotting routine called by GENHSTPLT
		and other programs

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
  Subroutine BSPLT allows one to plot one variable against another,
  with graphical display in a graphics window or on the terminal (ANSI
  standard/VT100 class), and output to a Postscript printing file.
  
  The first entry controls where the graph is displayed:
     0 for plot in the graphics window (which must have been enabled by
         selecting the appropriate option in the calling program)
     1 for plot on the terminal
  
  The next entry allows you to type or file the data or allows you to
  specify some aspects of a Postscript plot:
     0 for none of these options
     1 to type the data on the terminal
     -1 to store the data in the file
     n+1 to draw n lines in Postscript plot; e.g. 4 to draw 3 lines
     -n-1 to connect points with lines of thickness n in the Postscript
         plot; e.g. -2 to connect with lines of thickness 1.  For
         standard usage of the routine, subtract 100 to connect only
         points within the same (e.g. -102).  When the routine is
         called specifically to generate error bars, it will connect
         only within groups with -n-1, and subtracting 100 will make
         it connect all points.  Sorry about this.
  
  IF you elect to write the data to a file, next enter a file name.
     If the file already exists, the data will be appended to the file.

  The next entry can select a Postscript plot:
     0 for no plot - return to calling program
     6, 7, 8, 9 for Postscript plots in the upper left, lower left,
         upper right, or lower right quadrants of a page, or 10 to
         specify the size and location of the graph on the page.  The
         range of X and Y units plotted will be the same as in the
         plot on the screen.
     -6 to -10 for plots in the fixed or specified location, if you
         wish to change the range of X and Y units that will be plotted
         or control the number of ticks, and the grid and symbol size
         and thickness
  
  IF you selected a negative plot number, next make these entries:
  
     Lower and upper limits of the range of X units to be plotted,
         lower and upper limits for Y, and the number of ticks for the
         X and for the Y axis.  If one or both of these units are
         logarithmic, you will be informed of the range of the actual
         values (not of their logarithms), and you can then enter the
         lower and upper limits of the actual values, not of the
         logarithms.  For a linear axis, the "number of ticks" is
         actually the number of divisions along the axis; but for a
         logarithmic axis, it is the number of tick marks, which is
         the number of divisions plus 1.  Sorry again.  Enter negative
         the number of ticks to get unidirectional ticks.
  
     Tick and symbol size (in inches), grid and symbol thickness (small
         integers), 1 for a complete box, i.e. axes on all 4 sides.
         If you selected unidirectional ticks, positive and negative
         tick lengths give ticks toward the inside and outside of the
         box, respectively.
  
     If you are plotting error bars, next enter the total length of
         ticks at the ends of the bars, in inches.
  
  IF you selected graph 10 (or -10), make these entries:
         X and Y size of graph, and lower left X and Y coordinates, in
         inches.  Enter the negative of the left X coordinate to offset
         the vertical grid lines from the edge of the graphing area,
         and/or the negative of the lower Y coordinate to offset the
         horizontal grid lines.  (Sorry again)
  
     IF you entered a negative left X coordinate, enter the amount to
         offset the vertical grid lines in the X direction
  
     IF you entered a negative lower Y coordinate, enter the amount to
         offset the horizontal grid lines in the Y direction
  
     IF you are plotting fraction boxes, enter the box width, height
         and tick size
  
  IF you selected a graph and are plotting Tukey box plots, enter:
         Width of box, size of tick at 10/90% points, gap between
         ticks and outlying points (points closer than this amount to
         a tick will be omitted), and line thickness.  The first three
         values are all in inches.

  IF you selected a graph, enter 1 for a new page, or 0 to plot on the
     same page as any previous graphs
  
  IF you selected a negative graph number and the X-axis is
  logarithmic, enter the values at which X ticks should be drawn
  
  IF you selected a negative graph number and the Y-axis is
  logarithmic, enter the values at which Y ticks should be drawn
  
  IF you said that you wanted to draw some lines, next enter the
     specification for each line.  The format is:
     Slope (Y/X), Y-intercept, starting and ending X coordinate (all in
     your units, not inches), line thickness (small integer), and
     0,0 for a solid line or length of dash and length between dashes
     for a dashed line.  If you enter the negative of line thickness,
     then X and Y are inverted, so the entries are the X/Y slope, the
     X-intercept, and the starting and ending Y coordinates.

  IF you selected a negative graph number, then you can next make many
     entries to label the axes and add other symbols and lines to the
     graph.

  First, for the X axis, enter:

     # of ticks to label with numeric labels, and number of lines of
         text labels.
  
     IF you specified a nonzero number of ticks to label, next enter:

       If the ticks are to be labeled at regular intervals, enter the
           number of the first tick to label (first tick is #1) and
           the interval between labeled ticks (e.g. 2 for every other
           tick or enter 0,0 to specify a list of ticks to label.

           IF you entered 0,0, next enter the #'s of the ticks to label
  
       Labels for the ticks, in one line, separated by commas or spaces
  
       Numeric label size and separation from axis, in inches
  
     IF you specified a nonzero number of text labels, next enter for
         each label in turn:

        Text label size, separation from axis, and offset along axis
             between center of axis and center of text.
  
        Text label
  
  Next enter these parameters in the same order for the Y axis
  
  Finally, the program calls the IMMISC subroutine.  Here, coordinates
     may be specified in one of three ways independently for each of
     the entries to the program.  The coordinates may be in "user"
     units (the units of the numbers being graphed), in absolute units
     of inches on the plotter page, or in units relative to the frame
     of the graph (e.g. 0.1,0.9 for a position in the upper left
     corner, or 0.5,1.1 for a position centered above the graph frame).

     Enter the number of text labels, # of letters in circles,
         # of symbols in boxes, and # of dashed or solid lines to draw
  
     IF you entered a non-zero # of text labels, then for each, enter:
  
         X and Y position, and 0 for user or 1 for absolute or -1 for
             relative units 
  
         0 to center, -1 to left justify, or 1 to right justify the
             character string on this position
  
         Size of characters in inches, and orientation angle in
             degrees (usually 0 or 90)
  
         Text, on one line
  
     IF you entered a non-zero # of circled letters, then for each:
  
         X and Y position, and 0 for user or 1 for absolute or -1 for
             relative units 
  
         Diameter of circle in inches, line thickness

         Size of character in inches

         Letter (upper case)
  
     IF you entered a non-zero # of boxed symbols, then for each:
  
         X and Y position, and 0 for user or 1 for absolute or -1 for
             relative units 
  
         Symbol type (or 0 for no symbol), symbol size in inches, 
             symbol thickness (a small integer), box size in inches
             (or 0 for no box), box line thickness
  
     IF you entered a non-zero # of lines, then for each, enter:
  
         0 for user, 1 for absolute, or -1 for relative units
  
         A line specification as described above, in the units just
             indicated

  NOTE FOR SIMPLEST USE: If you just want some standard graphs, with
  the same scaling as appears on the screen, then there are only 4
  entries:
     0 for graphics, 1 for terminal plot
     0, or -2 if you need connected points
     6, 7, 8, or 9 (in that sequence)
     1 for new page
  Be sure to note down the range of X and Y values plotted.
