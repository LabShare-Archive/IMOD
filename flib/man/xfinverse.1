  Xfinverse will take the inverse of each transformation in a file.
  The only option is whether to set the translations to zero or retain
  them in the output.  The latter would give the true inverse, but the
  former has been useful in arcane realignment procedures.

  The transform file can consist of warping transformations instead of simple
  linear transforms.  The warping transforms can consist either of
  displacements at sets of control points or displacements on a regular grid.
  The output file has the same form as the input file.

  Xfinverse uses the PIP package for input (see the
  manual page for pip(1)). Thus, the following options can be specified
  either as command line arguments (with the -) or one per line in a
  command file (without the -):

 -input OR -InputFile   File name
    File with transforms to be inverted.  If this option is not entered, the
    first non-option argument will be used for this input file.

 -output OR -OutputFile   File name
    Output file for inverse transforms.  If this option is not entered, the
    second non-option argument will be used for the output file.

 -zero OR -ZeroShifts
    Set shifts to zero when taking inverse of linear transforms.

 -help OR -usage
    Print help output

  
  If no command line arguments are entered, the program takes the following
  inputs sequentially:
  
  Input file with list of transformations
  
  Output file for inverse transformations
  
  0 to set the translations (shifts) to zero, or one to retain them
  and output the true inverse transformation
