  MTPAIRING calculates the length over which MTs are paired with each
  other in 3-D, and allows one to recolor MTs absed on these pairing
  lengths.  It can also assign polarities to MTs based on the
  positions of their endpoints in Z, and allows one to recolor MTs
  based on these polarities.  The program combines features of
  MTOVERLAP and GENHSTPLT.  It also has several exploratory features
  that are not documented because they were not particularly useful.
  
  MTs are considered "paired" when they are within a certain distance
  of each other in the X/Y plane.  Typically, you would set this
  distance to be the upper limit of the peak from a neighbor density
  analysis.  The absolute pairing length for a pair of MTs is the
  total length in Z over which they are within that distance of each
  other.  A fractional pairing length is also computed; this is the
  pairing length divided by the length over which the two MTs appear
  in the same sections.

  Before running the program, you must figure out how to specify which
  MT's are in a bundle.  If all of the MT's in a model belong to
  one bundle, then this task is easy.  If you have several bundles in
  one model, then you have several alternatives.  One is to determine
  the lower and upper X, Y and Z coordinates of a box, such that the
  bundle consists of all MT's that contain at least one point within
  the box.  Another way is to make a model object within the plane
  of one section to serve as a boundary contour.  This contour,
  together with a lower and upper Z coordinate, specifies a "cylinder",
  and this program will include in the bundle any MT with at least one
  point inside this cylinder.  The most elaborate way is to make a
  series of model objects for boundary contours in different sections.
  The program will then include in the bundle any MT that is included
  within any one of the contours.
  
  When you enter X, Y or Z coordinates for this purpose, they must be
  index coordinates of the image file.  That is, X and Y values must
  be in terms of pixel coordinates, and Z values must be in units of
  the original section numbers, before adjustment for tilt or scaling
  by section thickness.

  If the sections were significantly tilted during microscopy, the
  program can adjust for these tilts given the proper information.
  Prepare a file in which the first line shows the Z value and the
  tilt of the first tilted section (or of the first section, if that
  one was tilted), and each successive line shows the Z value and tilt
  for each section on which tilt was changed.  Z values should occur in
  ascending order.

  When you start the program, you will have to make a standard series
  of entries until you get the first display.  From there, you can
  select a number of options to loop back and change those entries.
  Initial entries in order are:
  
  0 for plots in the graphics window, or 1 for plots only on the terminal.
     Note that if you need to use terminal plots, you will need to specify
     that option each time that you do a plot.
  
  Name of command file to take entries from, or Return to continue
  making entries from the keyboard. The program can read entries from
  a file instead of from the keyboard, then switch back to keyboard
  input if the file ends with the appropriate entry. 
  
  Number of bundles to read from model files, or 0 if the entries
  specifying all of the bundles are in yet another file.

  IF you enter a positive number, then enter for each bundle:
  
     Name of model file with bundle in it, or Return to use same file
     as previous bundle
  
     IF you enter the name of file, then make the following 3 entries:

        Name of file with information on tilt angles, or Return if
        there is no such file (pictures taken at 0 tilt)
  
        Section thickness in nm, to scale Z coordinates to microns;
        or / to leave Z values unscaled
  
        Magnification of negatives, and scale of digitization (the
        value of microns/pixel from VIDS), to scale the X/Y coordinates
        correctly; or / to leave X/Y coordinates unscaled.  This
        entry makes no difference unless you choose to calculate one
        of the special three-dimensional overlap factors.
  
     Number of limiting regions (boundary contours or rectangles
     defined by X/Y coordinates) needed to specify the bundle, or
     0 to take all of the objects in the model.
   
     For each limiting region, then enter:

        The number of an object specifying a boundary contour, or 0 to
        enter limiting X and Y coordinates of a box.
  
           IF you entered 0, next enter the lower and upper X index
           coordinates and the lower and upper Y coordinates of the
           box, or enter / to have no limit on the X and Y coordinates
           THEN enter the lower and upper Z coordinates of the box (in
           units of sections), or / to have no limits on Z coordinates
  
           IF you entered the number of a boundary object, next enter
           lower and upper Z coordinates of the "cylinder", or /
           to set those limiting coordinates to the Z coordinate of the
           boundary contour.  The latter is typical if one uses several
           contours in different sections to specify the bundle.
  
  IF you entered 0 for the number of bundles, next enter instead the 
  name of a file.  The first line of this file should have the number
  of bundles specified there.  The rest of the file should be all of
  the entries just described for each bundle.
  
  Enter a list of numbers of the bundles to work with.  Ranges may be
  entered, e.g. 1-3,7-9.

  The lower and upper limits of Z within which to compute pairing.
  
  A minimum number of sections to assume as shared sections when the
  fractional pairing is computed.  This entry was intended to avoid
  unreasonably large fractional pairing lengths when two MTs only
  appear together in a few sections.  A value of 4 may be useful.
  
  Enter a list of the types (colors) of MTs for which to compute
  pairing.  These will be the "reference MTs" in the pairing
  calculations.  Type Return to include all MTs.
  
  Enter a list of the types (colors) of MTs to consider as neighbors
  to those reference MTs.  Type Return to include all MTs.
  
  Enter 1 for a simple pairing factor which is 1 for MTs within a
  certain distance of each other and 0 beyond, or 2 or 3 for a pairing
  factor that decays with distance in the X/Y plane, either as an
  inverse power or exponentially.
  
  Enter the distance in the X/Y plane at and below which overlap will
  equal 1.  The distance should be in microns if you have scaled X/Y
  values, or in pixels if you have not.
  
     IF you entered 2, next enter the power for the decay (e.g., with
        a power of 2, overlap will decay as the inverse square of
        distance)
  
     IF you entered 3, enter instead the space constant for exponential
     decay.  Overlap will be 1/e less for MT's separated by 2 space
     constants than for MT's separated by 1 space constant.  Distance
     should be in microns if you have scaled X/Y values, or in pixels
     if you have not.
  
  Minimum pairing length that a pair of MTs should have before its
  data will be stored for examination.  If there are not hundreds of
  MTs, a minimum of 0 will retain all data about MTs with any pairing.
  
  At this point, the program computes the pairings and gives
  information about the lengths of the many pairs of MTs with no
  pairing.  You are then at the option point.  Options are:
  
  1: to plot the pairing data about each MT.  Columns available are:
     1 = MT length
     2 = absolute pairing length summed over all neighbors to the MT
     3 = maximum pairing length achieved with one other MT
     4 = fractional pairing length summed over all neighbors to the MT
     5 = maximum fractional pairing length achieved with one other MT
     6 = Z value of midpoint of MT.
  
  2: to plot the data about paired MTs.  Columns available are:
     1 = arithmetic mean of the lengths of the two MTs
     2 = geometric mean of the lengths of the two MTs
     3 = absolute pairing length of that pair
     4 = fractional pairing length
     9 = mean separation between MTs while they were paired
    10 = SD of separation
    11 = coefficient of variation = SD/mean of separation

  With either option 1 or 2, you must enter the numbers of the columns
  to be plotted on the X or Y axes.  Next, enter a number for the
  symbol type as commonly referred to in Genhstplt(1) and other places.
  After this, you will enter the BSPLT subroutine, whose entries are
  described in the manpage for Bsplt(1).
  
  3: to loop back to the point where you specify which bundles to work
  with and then enter other parameters of the pairing calculations.
  
  4: to loop back and read in new bundles, replacing existing ones.

  5: to loop back and read in new bundles, retaining existing ones.
  
  6/7: to plot the current metacode file on the screen/printer
  
  8: to exit the program
  
  9: to recolor the model.  After selecting this option, you make an
  indefinite series of entries of the following form.  In one line,
  you enter the following information to select a set of MTs:
  
     New color of MTs.  Enter -1 here to terminate the series of
     recolorings.
  
     Column to use to select MTs.  The data about each MT are referred
     to by positive column numbers (1 to 6 as described above); the
     data about pairs are referred to by negative column numbers (-1
     to -4 as described above).  An entry of 0 will use the "polarity"
     values determined after using options 11 and 12.
  
     The lower and upper criterion limits to apply to values in that
     column.
  
     0 to select MTs that are within the limits, or 1 to select ones
     outside the limits.
  
     On the next line, enter a list of the original colors that MTs
     should have in order for them to be recolored according to these
     criteria, or Return to apply the criteria to MTs of all colors.
  
  In this way, you can recolor each color of MT that meets a particular
  criterion to a particular new color.
  
  After you have entered all of the selections, enter the name of the
  output file in which to place the recolored model.
  
  10: to take commands from a file (next enter filename, or Return to
     take input from the keyboard)
  
  11 will find clusters of mutually paired MTs (which can be all of
  the MTs in a bundle), 12 will find polarities based on positions of
  the MTs in the bundle or cluster, and 13 will graph the clusters.
  These features are not documented here - consult command files for
  examples (these files may call this program "COMSYMP").
