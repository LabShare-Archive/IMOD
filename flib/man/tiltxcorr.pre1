  TILTXCORR uses cross-correlation to find an initial translational alignment
  between successive images of a tilt series.  For a given pair of images, it
  stretches the image with the larger tilt angle perpendicular to the tilt
  axis, by an amount equal to the ratio of the cosines of the two tilt angles
  (cosine stretch).  The stretched image is correlated with the other image,
  and the position of the peak of the correlation indicates the relative shift
  between the images.  There are options to use only a subset of the image, to
  pad the image with a border before correlating, and to taper the image
  intensities down to the average level over some boundary region.  The latter
  feature is particularly important for getting reliable correlation peaks.
  The program also has an option to correlate each image with the sum of
  already-aligned images at lower tilts, a method developed by Christian
  Renken.  In addition, the program can be used to track the centers of
  multiple subareas through the tilt series and produce an IMOD model that can
  be used for fiducial alignment.  The program will reduce the size of images
  larger than 1180 pixels in one dimension by binning them down, i.e. by
  averaging the values in square sets of adjacent pixels (2x3, or 3x3, etc).
  Images are binned by the smallest factor needed to make them 1180 or smaller
  up to a binning of 4, but there is option to set the binning directly.

  Some notes about some of the options:
  
  Filtering: Some high pass filtering, using a small value of Sigma1 such as
  0.03, may be needed to keep the program from being misled by very large
  scale features in the images.  If the images are noisy, some low pass
  filtering with Sigma2 and Radius2 is appropriate (e.g. 0.05 for Sigma2, 0.25
  for Radius2).  If the images are binned, these values specify frequencies in
  the binned image, so a higher cutoff (less filtering) might be appropriate.
  The filter functions produced by these options can be visualized with the
  program Filterplot(1); see that man page for a full description of their
  effects.
  
  Central peak exclusion: The exclusion of a central peak may be helpful when
  there is fixed noise in the images due to inadequate gain normalization of
  CCD camera images.  Because one image is stretched, this spurious peak can
  actually occur anywhere in an elongated region perpendicular to the tilt
  axis. If the real alignment happens to fall in that streak, then it will be
  ignored as well, and an incorrect alignment will be found.  For this reason,
  this option should be used only when necessary, as it will misalign images
  that are already nearly aligned.
  
  Subareas: Trimming some area off the edges of the images may be helpful if
  those areas are particularly out of focus or contain material with no useful
  features in it.  The area to be used for correlation can be offset from the
  center of the image by specifying starting and ending coordinates of the
  region to correlate instead of the amount to trim off.  The coordinates
  should be chosen from the zero-tilt image; the program will shift the
  specified box closer to the center of the image at higher tilts so that it
  will contain approximately the same features.  By default, the
  transformations will be adjusted to move the tilt axis back to the center of
  the whole image, but there is an option to leave the axis at the center of
  the correlated area instead.  Note that global rather than image-to-image
  transforms are output in this case; see below for details.
  
  Padding: Padding is customarily done to reduce the contribution to the
  correlation from wrapped around features, which occurs when correlation is
  done with Fourier transforms.  Extensive padding does not help with typical
  biological specimens but may be needed for specimens with periodic
  structures, in which case one should pad each edge by half the image size.
  
  Tapering: In contrast, tapering the images down to a mean intensity at their
  edges is very important.  Tapering over as few as 20 pixels may be adequate,
  but fewer artifacts will appear in the correlation with longer tapers (say,
  50 to 100 pixels).
  
  Cumulative correlation: Tiltxcorr has an option to use a cumulative
  correlation method developed by Christian Renken at the National Center for
  the Visualization of Biological Complexity in Albany, N.Y.  With this
  option, the program will take the image at zero tilt as the first reference,
  and correlate it with the image at the next most negative tilt.  It will
  then add the aligned image to the first reference to make the reference for
  the next tilt.  At each tilt, the reference will be the sum of images that
  have already been aligned.  When the most negative tilt angle is reached,
  the procedure is repeated from the zero-tilt view to more positove tilt
  angles.  (If you specify a range of views to correlate that does not pass
  through zero tilt, then this procedure will start at the lowest tilt in the
  specified range.)  There are two options that can be used with this
  procedure.  By default, aligned images are not cosine-stretched before being
  added into the cumulative reference; but the "absstretch" option will add
  images that have been stretched by the inverse of the cosine of the tilt
  angle into the reference.  The "nostretch" option will disable the cosine
  stretching that is used before correlating an image with the reference.

  180-degree tilt series: If the object being viewed is compact rather than
  slab-like and it is tilted close to 90 degrees, then the cosine stretching
  between views is not appropriate.  Use the "nostretch" option in this case.
  With this option, the program will also not attempt to adjust the shifts
  between images to keep the tilt axis in the center, a procedure which fails
  close to 90 degrees.

  Tracking patches: In a completely different mode of operation, the program
  can track the center positions of multiple subareas (patches) through the
  tilt series and produce an IMOD model.  There is no feature detection
  involved here, so the alignment of patches from two successive views is
  averaged over all the image features in the patch.  Patch tracking is
  invoked by entering the -size option to specify the size of the patches.
  The positions of the patches are specified by entering the number of patches
  in X and Y, or by providing a model with scattered points indicating the
  positions of the patch centers.  In the latter case, the points may be on
  any view, but their positions will be transferred by cosine stretching to
  the view nearest to zero tilt, and the tracking will start at that view.
  Note that patches smaller than 1180 pixels will be correlated without
  binning by default, whereas the whole image will typically be binned for
  correlation.  As a result, the patch correlations may be noisier and may
  require either more high-frequency filtering or explicit binning.

  Boundary contours: Boundary contours may be used to constrain the region
  being correlated for alignment or the locations tracked by correlation.
  Contours may be drawn on any view but they will be stretched by 1/cosine of
  the tilt angle to determine their position on the zero-tilt view.  When
  correlating whole images to obtain transforms, the boundary contours are
  used in two ways.  First, the minimum rectangular area containing the
  contours at zero tilt is determined; this area is limited by the -border,
  -xminmax and -yminmax options to define the area that will be used for
  correlation.  Second, on each view, the contours are contracted from their
  positions at zero tilt by the cosine of the tilt angle, and the area outside
  the contours is masked out by setting it to the image mean.  The masked
  image is correlated with an unmasked image at the previous tilt.  Multiple
  contours may be drawn, and they may intersect.  If there is only one
  contour, the image intensity inside the unmasked region is tapered down to
  the mean at the edge over the course of 16 pixels, equivalent to running
  Mrctaper(1) on the image.  This tapering may help prevent artifacts due to
  sharp edges, but it is not done if there is more than one image.  If
  tapering and the inclusion of separated areas are both important, use a
  single contour with a narrow connector between them, but take care that the
  contour does not cross itself.

  Boundary contours are used differently when correlating to track the centers
  of patches.  The program determines the fraction of each patch that is
  within the contours at zero tilt, and then eliminates patches whose
  fractions are less than 0.75.  There is no masking of the image regions that
  fall outside the boundaries in this case.

  Tiltxcorr uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for pip(1))
  and can still take sequential input interactively, to maintain compatibility
  with old command files.  The following options can be specified either as
  command line arguments (with the -) or one per line in a command file or
  parameter file (without the -):

INSERT OPTION TEXT HERE

  -StandardInput
     Read parameter entries from standard input.


  If there are no command-line arguments, Tiltxcorr takes sequential input
  the old way, with the following entries:
  
  Image input file

  Piece list file for reordering the Z values in the stack, or Return
  if none

  Output file for F transforms
  
  -1 to enter individual tilt angle for each view, 1 to specify a
  starting and increment tilt, or 0 to read tilt angles from a file
  
  IF you entered 1, next enter the starting and incremental tilt angles
  IF you entered -1, enter the tilt angle of each view.
  IF you entered 0, enter name of file with tilt angles
  
  Angle of rotation of the tilt axis in the images; specifically, the
  angle from the vertical to the tilt axis (counterclockwise
  positive).

  Filter parameters to filter the correlation, or / for no filter
  (Enter values of Sigma1, Sigma2, Radius1, Radius2 just as for
  ENHANCE.)

  1 to exclude a central correlation peak due to fixed pattern noise
  in the images, or 0 not to
  
  Nymber of pixels to trim off each side in the X and Y dimensions, or /
  to use the whole image area
  
  Borders (in pixels) with which to pad images in the X and Y dimensions,
  or / for the default, which is 5% of the image dimensions up to 20
  pixels
  
  Distances in pixels over which to taper image intensities down to the
  mean at the edges, in the X and Y dimensions.  Enter / for the default,
  which is 10% of the image dimensions up to 100 pixels

  Starting and ending view #'s (first is 1), or / for all views
