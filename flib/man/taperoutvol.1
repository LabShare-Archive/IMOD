  TAPEROUTVOL will cut a subset out of an image volume, pad it into a
  larger volume, and taper the intensity down to the mean value of the
  volume over the extent of the padding region, i.e., from the edge of
  the actual excised pixels to the edge of the new volume.  None of
  the original excised pixels are attenuated by this method.  The
  resulting volume will have dimensions suitable for taking the FFT.
  
  Inputs to the program:
  
  Name of input file
  
  Name of output file
  
  The starting and ending X index coordinates (number from 0), the
  starting and ending Y index coordinates, and the starting and ending
  Z index coordinates to extract.  The default is the whole volume
  
  The width of the borders, in X, Y, and Z, with which to pad the
  image block.  Borders will be made larger as necessary to make the
  output image size suitable for taking an FFT.
  
  The program will stop with an error message if the subset or the
  output image is too large, or if the subset is not entirely within
  the input volume.
