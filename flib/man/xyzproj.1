 	  This program will compute projections of a 3-dimensional block of an
 	  image file at a series of tilts around either the X, the Y or the Z
 	  axis.  The block may be any arbitrary subset of the image file.
 	  
 	  A projection along a ray line is simply the average of the pixels in
 	  the block along that line.  However, rather than taking the values of
 	  the pixels that lie near the ray, interpolation is used to sample
 	  density at points evenly spaced at one pixel intervals along the ray.
 	  
 	  Inputs to the program are:
 
 	  Input image file
 	  
 	  Output image file
 	  
 	  Index coordinates (with numbering starting from 0 in X, Y and Y) of
 	  the starting and ending X, Y then Z coordinates of the block.  The
 	  default is the whole image file.  The Z coordinates may be entered
 	  in inverted order (e.g. 56,34) and should be so entered if the input
 	  stack is a tomogram that was built in inverted order.
 
 	  Axis to tilt around for projections.  Enter X, Y or Z.  The Z axis
 	  passes perpendicular to the sections in the file.
 	  
 	  Starting tilt angle, ending tilt angle, and increment to apply
 	  between these limits.  All angles are allowed.
 	  
 	  Width (x dimension) of the output images.  An appropriate default may
 	  be selected with /
 	  
 	  Data mode for output file.
 	  
 	  Scaling factors to apply to the average pixel values: a factor to be
 	  added to the values, then a factor to multiply by after the addition.
 	  The default is 0,1, for no scaling.
 	  
 	  Value to fill parts of the output image that have no points in the
 	  block projecting to them  The scaling factors are applied to this
 	  value.  The default is the mean of the input file.
 	  
 	  
 	  The user must determine the proper scaling in order to output data
 	  most efficiently (mode 0).  The user must also set the header
 	  information properly to make get the coordinate system to correspond
 	  to that of the input image file.  This program does not set up the
 	  header to indicate that the output file is a tilt series.
