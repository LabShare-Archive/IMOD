  Warpvol will transform a volume using a series of general linear
  transformations. Its main use is to "warp" one tomogram from
  a two-axis tilt series so that it matches the other tomogram.
  For each position in the volume, it interpolates between adjacent
  transformations to find the transformation appropriate for that
  position.  Any initial alignment transformation (from Solvematch) must
  be already contained in the transformations entered into this program;
  this combining of transformations is accomplished by Findwarp.  It can
  work with either a 2-D matrix of transformations (varying in X and Z) or
  with a general 3-D matrix, as output by Findwarp.  The program uses the
  same algorithm as Rotatevol for rotating large volumes.

  Warpvol uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for pip(1))
  and can take input interactively for options that existed when it was
  converted, to maintain compatibility with old command files.  The
  following options can be specified either as command line arguments (with
  the -) or one per line in a command file or parameter file (without 
  the -):

INSERT OPTION TEXT HERE

  -StandardInput
     Read parameter entries from standard input.


  If the program is started with no command line arguments, it reverts to
  interactive input with the following entries:
  
  Name of the input file to be transformed

  Name of the output file for the transformed volume

  Path name of directory (for example, /usr/tmp) where temporary files
     can be placed, or Return to have files placed in the current
     directory

  X, Y, and Z dimensions of the output file, or / to accept the default
     values, which are NZ, NY, and NX of the input volume (a 90-degree
     rotation about the Y axis)
  
  Name of the file with the matrix of inverse transformations
     (produced by Findwarp)
