  This is a companion program for the shell script Transferfid.
  It is used to give the user a list of how points correspond between
  the original fiducial model and the new seed model, and to repack
  the seed model to eliminate empty contours.  If it is given a file
  listing object and contour numbers for fiducials whose positions
  have been solved for in the first set, the 

  Its inputs are:

  File name of original fiducial model for the first axis
  
  Name of file with X/Y/Z coordinates, as produced by Tiltalign, or
  Return if none available

  Name of new seed model for the second axis, produced by Beadtrack and
  stripped of points from the first axis
  
  Output file for final repacked seed model
