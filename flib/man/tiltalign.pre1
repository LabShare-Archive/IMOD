  This program will solve for the displacements, rotations, tilts, and
  magnification differences relating a set of tilted views of an object.  It
  uses a set of fiducial points that have been identified in a series of
  views. These input data are read from a model in which each fiducial point
  is a separate contour.

  This program has five notable features:

  1) Any given fiducial point need not be present in every view. Thus, one
  can track each fiducial point only through the set of views in which it can
  be reliably identified, and one can even skip views in the middle of that
  set.

  2) The program can solve for distortion (stretching) in the plane of the
  section.  It does so with two additional variables: "dmag", an increment to
  the magnification along the X axis; and "skew", the difference in rotation
  between the X and Y axis.  If there is stretch in the plane of the
  sections, then in general the aligned images will backproject correctly
  only at one plane in Z.  This solution thus includes a set of adjustment
  factors that can be passed to the Tilt program to correct for this effect.

  3) It is possible to constrain several views to have the same unknown value
  of rotation, tilt angle, magnification, compression, or distortion.  This
  can reduce the number of unknowns and can give more accurate overall
  solutions.
  
  4) If the fiducial points are supposed to lie in one or two planes, then
  after the minimization procedure is complete, the program can analyze the
  solved point positions and determine the slope of this plane.  It uses this
  slope to estimate how to adjust tilt angles so as to make the planes be
  horizontal in a reconstruction.

  5) The program can solve for a series of local alignments using subsets of
  the fiducial points.  This can be useful when aligning a large area which
  does not behave uniformly during the tilt series.  The local alignments can
  then be used to obtain a single large reconstruction whose resolution is as
  good as would be attained in a smaller volume.

  The constraining of different views to have related values of some unknown
  variable is called "mapping"; it works differently for tilt than for other
  variables.  For variables other than tilt, if two or more views are mapped
  to the same variable, then all of those views will have the same value.
  For tilt angle, if two views are mapped to the same tilt variable, then the
  DIFFERENCE between their tilt angles is constrained to be a constant equal
  to the difference between their initial tilt angles.  So, if they have the
  same initial tilt angle, they will always have the same tilt; and if their
  initial tilt angles differ by 10, their tilt angles will always differ by
  10.
  
  Mapping can be set up relatively easily with "automapping".  When you
  select automapping, the program will map views in a group of adjacent views
  to the same variable, and it will determine a set of groups of a specified
  size.  You control the mapping by specifying the default size of the
  groups.  In addition, if some views need to be grouped differently, you can
  specify one or more ranges of views to have different sized groups.

  With automapping, the program can also set up variables that change
  linearly from one group to the next, rather than being constrained to the
  same value for all views in a group.  In other words, the values for all of
  the views in a group will be a linear combination of the same two actual
  variables (typically the first one in the group and the first one in the
  next group).  This feature usually gives a solution with less error.  The
  distinction between actual variables and combinations can be seen in the
  "Variable mappings" table.  Actual variables would appear as, e.g., "tilt
  15" and "tilt 25", while combinations of the two appear as "t 15+ 20".
  There are also linear combinations between a variable and a fixed value,
  which appear in the table as "t 70+fix".  Currently, the linear mapping is
  available only with automapping, not with manually specified mappings.
  
  With automapping, the size of the groups will be adjusted dynamically for
  two variables, tilt angle and x-axis stretch, so that groups become smaller
  at higher tilt angles.  This is done because it is easier to solve
  accurately for tilt angle at higher tilt, and because the solution for
  x-axis stretch tends to change rapidly at high tilts.  The group size that
  you specify for these variables will be the average size of the whole range
  of tilts.  If this dynamic automapping gives problems with tilt angle, use
  mapping in blocks rather than linear mapping to have stricter control over
  the mapping process.  The dynamic automapping is used for both kinds of
  mapping of x-axis stretch because the mapping in blocks is the preferred
  method for grouping this variable.  (Linear mapping does not always work
  properly.)
  
  The size of groups when automapping will also be adjusted to provide more
  grouping when some views have only one or two points.  Specifically, views
  with fewer than 3 points will not be counted toward the total number of
  views to be included in a group.  This feature is most important with the
  local alignments described next, where there may be relatively few points in
  a local area.

  The program can embark on local alignments after obtaining the standard
  global solution with all of the fiducials.  The program divides the image
  area, or the area occupied by fiducials, into a regular array of overlapping
  subareas.  Fiducials whose X and Y coordinates fall within a subarea are
  included in the computations for that subarea.  A subarea is expanded about
  its center, if necessary, to include a certain minimum number of fiducials.
  The program then seeks a solution for the subset of fiducials that is, for
  all variables, "incremental" to the global solution; that is, it solves for
  variables that are added to the parameters from the global solution.  This
  method allows a dramatic reduction in the number of variables to be solved
  for, mostly because rotation and magnification can be mapped to a much
  smaller number of variables than in the global solution.  The usual need for
  each view to have its own rotation and magnification variable is already
  accommodated in the global solution.
  
  One option in the local alignment is whether to solve for the X-Y-Z
  coordinates of the subset of fiducials, or to fix them at their values from
  the global solution.  Solving for the coordinates may give a more accurate
  solution but it does require more fiducials to get a reliable result.
  Fixing the coordinates reduces the number of variables to be solved for and
  allows a reliable solution with only a relatively few fiducials; it also
  avoids distortions in the resulting reconstruction that could be difficult
  to account for when trying to combine reconstructions from tilts around two
  axes.

  The program implements the following model for the imaging of the specimen
  in each individual view:
  1) The specimen itself changes by 
    a) an isotropic size change (magnification variable); 
    b) additional thinning in the Z dimension (compression variable); and 
    c) linear stretch along one axis in the specimen plane, implemented by
       variables representing stretch along the X axis and skew between the X
       and Y axes;
  2) The specimen is tilted slightly around the X axis (X tilt variable)
  3) The specimen is tilted around the X axis by the negative of the beam tilt,
     if any (one variable for all views)
  4) The specimen is tilted around the Y axis (tilt variable)
  5) The specimen is tilted back around the X axis by the beam tilt, if any 
  6) The projected image rotates in the plane of the camera (rotation
     variable)
  7) The projected image may stretch along an axis midway between the original
     X and Y axes (one variable for all views)
  8) The image shifts on the camera

  Only a subset of this complete model can be solved for in any given case.
  In particular, thinning cannot be solved for together with tilt angle and
  stretch along the X axis; it is very difficult to solve for X axis tilt
  together with rotation angle; and it is almost impossible to solve for beam
  tilt together with rotation and skew.

INPUTS TO THE PROGRAM
  
  In all entries of view numbers, the views are numbered from 1.

  Tiltalign uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for pip(1))
  and can still take sequential input interactively, to maintain compatibility
  with old command files.  The following options can be specified either as
  command line arguments (with the -) or one per line in a command file or
  parameter file (without the -):

INSERT OPTION TEXT HERE

  -StandardInput
     Read parameter entries from standard input.

SEQUENTIAL INPUTS
  
  If there are no command-line arguments, Tiltalign takes sequential input
  the old way, with the following entries:
  
  Parameters are entered in the following order.  Lines starting with
  IF are entered only for particular choices on the preceding line.

  Model file name

  Name of image file on which model was built, or a blank line

  IF a blank line was entered, next enter the image dimensions NX & NY,
      the X and Y origin (default is 0,0), and the X and Y delta
      values (default is 1,1).

  Either a filename with an extension containing "mod" to output a
        3-D model of the fiducials based on their solved positions,
      or a filename with extension containing "res" for a list of all 
        residuals, which can be converted to a model with Patch2imod,
      or a filename with neither text in the extension to get both outputs, 
        one with extension .3dmod and one with extension .resid,
      or a blank line for neither output

  Name of file to which to write (in ASCII text) the solved X-Y-Z
      coordinates, or a blank line for no text output

  Name of file to which to write a list of the solved tilt angles,
      or a blank line for no tilt angle output

  Name of output file for solutions and/or transformations

  -1 to put only the solved values of the parameters in the output file
      or 1 to put only transformations for aligning the images
        into the output file,
      or 0 to put both in the file.

  0 to include all views that have points in the model file
      or 1 to specify the starting, ending, and increment views to
        include
      or 2 to enter a list of the individual views to include
      or 3 to enter a list of views to exclude

  IF 1 was selected, next enter the starting and ending view number
       and the increment to use between those values

  OR IF 2 was selected, enter a list of views to be included.  Ranges 
      may be entered; e.g. 0-3,6-8
  
  OR IF 3 was selected, enter a list of views to be excluded

  Initial angle of rotation in the plane of projection.  This is the
      rotation (CCW positive) from the Y-axis (the tilt axis after the
      views are aligned) to the suspected tilt axis in the unaligned
      views.

  0 to solve for all rotation angles (and thus to solve for tilt axis),
      or the number of the view to fix at the initial rotation angle
        (and thus fix the tilt axis at that angle for that view)
      or -1 to solve for a single global rotation of the tilt axis
      or -2 to fix all rotation angles at the initial angle

  Number of sets of views to treat separately from the main set of
      views in any automapping of variables.  Enter 0 if you will not
      be using automapping or if all views can be treated together
      when automapping.  These sets would typically be lists of views
      that were reshot so they will be referred to as reshoot sets.
  
  IF a number other than 0 was entered, next enter one line for each
      separate set, giving a list of the views included in that set.
      Ranges are allowed here.

  -1 to enter initial tilt angles individually, 1 to enter starting
      and increment tilt angles, or 0 to read tilt angles from a file

  Either the individual tilt angles (ranges NOT allowed), the
      starting and increment tilt angles, or the name of a file with
      tilt angles, depending on whether you just entered -1, 1, or 0.

  Tilt angle offset, i.e. amount to ADD to all entered tilt angles

  0 to fix all tilt angles at their initial values
      or 1 to solve for all tilt angles except for a specified view
      or 2 to solve for all tilt angles except for the view at minimum
        tilt 
      or 3 to solve for all tilt angles except for a specified view
        and the view at minimum tilt
      or 4 to specify some other combination of fixed, variable, and
        mapped tilt angles
      or 5 or 6 to automap groups of tilt angles; 5 for linearly 
         changing values or 6 for values all the same within a group 
      or 7 or 8 to automap and fix two tilt angles; 7 for linearly 
         changing values or 8 for values all the same within a group 
  
  IF 1, 3, 7 or 8 was selected, next enter the number of the view 
        whose tilt angle will be fixed.

  IF 7 or 8 was selected, next enter the number of the second view
        whose tilt angle will be fixed.

  IF 4 was selected, next enter a variable number for each view, or 0
      to fix the view at its initial tilt.  For convenience, these
      variable numbers can be completely arbitrary; e.g. 0,1,1,1,2,2
      and 0,9,9,9,5,5 both do the same thing: fix the tilt for view 1,
      map the tilts for views 2, 3 and 4 to the first tilt variable,
      and map the tilts for views 5 and 6 to the second tilt variable.

  IF 5 to 8 was selected, next enter the default number of views to
      group together, and the number of ranges of views that should
      have some grouping other than the default.  If a negative number
      of views is entered, then reshoot sets will NOT be segregated
      from the rest of the views in this default mapping.
  
      IF you entered a non-zero number of ranges to be treated
         separately, then for each such range, enter the starting and
         ending view number and the number of views that should be
         grouped in that range.  If a negative number of views is
         entered, then reshoot sets will NOT be segregated from the
         rest of the views in this range.

  Number of "reference" view whose magnification will be fixed at 1.0.
      Enter "/" to accept the default, which is the view at minimum
      tilt.

  0 to fix all magnifications at 1.0,
      or 1 to vary all magnifications independently,
      or 2 to specify a mapping of magnification variables
      or 3 or 4 for automapping of variables; 3 for linearly changing 
      values or 4 for values all the same within a group 

  IF 2 was selected, enter a magnification variable number for each
      view.  As for tilts, these variable numbers can be completely
      arbitrary.  The reference view (typically the one at minimum
      tilt angle) will be constrained to a mag of 1.0; to constrain
      any other views to a mag of 1.0, simply map them to the same
      variable number as for the reference view.

  IF 3 or 4 was selected, enter default group size, number of special
      ranges, and group size for each such range just as for tilt
      variable automapping.

  0 to omit section compression,
      or the number of the view to fix at compression 1.0 (something
        other than a view whose tilt angle is fixed at zero.)

  IF compression is being solved for, next enter 1 to have all
      compressions be independent, or 2 to specify mappings of
      compression variables, or 3 or 4 for automapping; 3 for linearly 
      changing values or 4 for values all the same within a group
  
      IF 2 was selected, enter a compression variable number for each
         view.  As for tilts, these variable numbers can be completely
         arbitrary.  The reference view will be constrained to a comp
         of 1.0; to constrain any other views to a comp of 1.0, simply
         map them to the same variable number as for the reference
         view.  A View with tilt fixed at zero will automatically have
         its comp fixed at 1.0 UNLESS you map it to another view whose
         tilt is not fixed at zero.

      IF 3 or 4 was selected, enter default group size, number of 
         special ranges, and group size for each such range just as
         for tilt variable automapping.

  0 to omit section distortion, 1 to include distortion and use the
      same set of mappings for X-axis stretch and skew variables, or
      2 to specify separate mappings for these two variables.
  
  IF 1 or 2 was selected, answer the next two queries either once
      (for distortion variables in general) or twice (first for the
      X-axis stretch, then for the skew):
  
      1 for independent variables, 2 to specify a mapping, or 3 or 4
         for automapping.  For X-axis stretch, 3 will make values be 
         all the same within a group and 4 will make values change
         linearly (not recommended).  For skew, use 3 for linearly
         changing values or 4 for values all the same within a group.
  
      IF 2 was selected, enter a variable number for each view.  The
         reference view for magnification will be constrained to
         distortion values of 0; to constrain any other views to 0
         distortion, map them to the same variable number as for the
         reference view.

      IF 3 or 4 was selected, enter default group size, number of 
         special ranges, and group size for each such range just as
         for tilt variable automapping.

  Criterion number of standard deviations above mean residual error
      that should be reported.  This can be based on either the overall
      mean and S.d. of the residual errors, or on a mean and S.d.
      computed from points in nearby views.  Enter a positive value 
      for a report based on overall mean, or a negative value for a
      report based on the mean residual in the same and nearby views.

  0 to omit analysis of surfaces,
      or 1 or 2 to derive a tilt angle offset by assuming that
      points lie on 1 or 2 surfaces.

  "Factor", and limit on number of cycles, for the variable metric
      minimization (METRO).  "Factor" determines how large a step METRO
      tries to take.  The default for "factor" is 0.5, but smaller
      values of 0.35 or even 0.25 are needed for large data sets.  The
      default # of cycles is 500.  When METRO fails for various reasons,
      the program will retry with several other, mostly smaller values
      of the factor.

  IF transformations are being computed, next enter two more lines:

      Amount to shift the tilt axis in Z, relative to the centroid in 
      Z of the fiducial points, or 1000 to shift the tilt axis to the
      midpoint of the range of Z values 

      Amount to shift the tilt axis in X away from the center of the 
      image
  
  0 to exit, or 1 to do a series of local alignments.  If you enter 1
      to do local alignments, a series of entries is required to
      specify the special parameters for local alignment, then a
      series of entries to specify the mapping of variables.  Entries
      continue with:
  
  Name of output file in which to place transformations for local
      alignment.
  
  Number of local patches in X and in Y in which to obtain a solution
      from the fiducials located in that patch.  These patches will be 
      aranged so as to cover the whole image area.
  
  Either the minimum size of each patch in X and Y (enter values > 1)
      or the minimum fractional overlap between patches (values < 1)
  
  Minimum total number of fiducials, and minimum number present on each
      surface if two surfaces were assumed in the analysis of
      surfaces.  A patch will be expanded about its center until it
      contains enough points to meet both of these criteria.
  
  0 to solve for the X-Y-Z coordinates of the fiducials independently
      in each local area, or 1 to fix them at their values from the
      global solution
  
  Three entries to control the output of results for each local
      alignment: 1 to output the values of the parameters for each
      view or 0 not to; 1 to output the X-Y-Z coordinates of fiducials
      or 0 not to; 1 to output points with high residuals, or 0 not to
  
  Finally, there are a series of entries just as above, to control the
  mapping of rotation, tilt, magnification and distortion variables:
  
  0 to fix all rotations, 1 to have them all be independent, 2 to
      specify a mapping of rotation variables, 3 for automapping with
      linearly changing values, or 4 for automapping in blocks of
      values.  After this, enter mapping information as appropriate.
  
  0-8 to specify treatment of tilt variables, as described above.
      After this, enter mapping information for tilt variables as
      appropriate.

  Number of "reference" view whose magnification will be fixed at 1.0.
      Enter "/" to use the view at minimum tilt.

  0-3 to specify treatment of magnification variables, as described
      above.  Then enter mapping information as appropriate.
  
  0 to omit section distortion, 1 to include distortion and use the
      same set of mappings for X-axis stretch and skew variables, or
      2 to specify separate mappings for these two variables.  After
      this, enter specifications for treatment of each or both sets of
      parameters, just as above.


  Note: when compression is solved for, the program prints both the
  absolute and the incremental compression for each view.  When no
  compression is solved for, the program prints instead two additional
  columns: "deltilt" is the difference between the solved and original
  tilt angles, and "mean resid" is the mean residual error for each
  view.
