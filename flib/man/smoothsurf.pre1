  This program will smooth a surface defined by model contours, adjusting
  the positions of points in each contour as needed.  At each point on the
  surface, it fits a 3-D polynomial to all points within a defined range of
  Z-levels and within a specified distance of the central point.  That
  point's position is then replaced by the fitted position from the
  polynomial.  After this surface smoothing operation, each contour is
  independently smoothed by local fitting to 2-D (ordinary) polynomials.

  The default values for the number of Z levels (sections or slices) and
  for the maximum distance in 3D should give a good starting point for
  smoothing models drawn on tomographic reconstructions.  Increase or
  decrease these two numbers together to increase or decrease the
  smoothing.  Because the default values give a big disparity between the
  total extent in Z versus X and Y (7 versus 30), the Z range should be
  increased more than the distance.  For example, try "-nz 11 -dist 20" and
  "-nz 15 -dist 25" for progressively more smoothing.  If you want to
  experiment more broadly with the parameters, you can try changing the
  balance between these two numbers, as well as omitting the independent
  contour smoothing with "-cont 0".

  For serial section reconstructions, note that the Z scaling is NOT taken
  into account in computing 3D distances, so the maximum distance
  corresponds more closely to distance in the X/Y planes than to true 3D
  distance.  The default parameters may be a good starting point, but here
  it may be appropriate to increase the maximum distance more relative to
  the number of sections (e.g., start with "-dist 25").
  
  Smoothsurf moves only the contours, not the points in any existing
  meshes.  To see the resulting surface, you need to rerun imodmesh(1).

  Smoothsurf uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for pip(1)).
  The following options can be specified either as command line arguments
  (with the -) or one per line in a command file or parameter file (without
  the -):

  smoothing, made it work properly with pixel sizes in image file header
