  Genhstplt is a general-purpose interface to the BSHST and BSPLT histogram
  and 2-dimensional data plotting routines.  See the documentation of those
  routines (bshst(1) and bsplt(1)) for instructions on operating them.
  
  The data file may have 1 or more columns of data values for each individual.
  Before the first column of data, one may place a "type" value for each
  individual.  One can then form "groups" of values by combining individuals
  of one or more types.  If there are no type values, then there is only one
  group, consisting of all individuals in the file.  The actual type values
  are completely arbitrary and need not be 1, 2, 3, etc.  Once groups are
  formed, they are referred to in order as 1, 2, etc.
  
  The file may have lines at the beginning which can be skipped by the
  program.  The number of columns of data values can be detected by the
  program as long as all the columns for an individual are on the same line in
  the file.  Otherwise, the number of columns (exclusive of the optional type
  value) may be put in the file, in the line just before the data begin, or it
  may be entered into the program interactively.  Non-numeric text can be
  present after the last column of data.

  Sometimes it is desirable to have one graph show two or more columns in Y
  plotted versus the same column in X.  If the data does not already have type
  values, they may be rearranged so that each column becomes a separate type.
  One column is chosen as the X column and is copied into column 1 of the
  rearranged data, and all columns are copied sequentially into column 2 of
  the rearranged data and given type numbers equal to their original column
  numbers.  This rearrangement can be done when first reading in the data, or
  later by using option 15.  The same option can be used to restore the data
  to the original columnar organization.
  
  Symbol types are selected by numbers from 1 to 19 and can be open and filled
  square (1 & 2), open and filled diamond (3 & 4), open and filled triangle (5
  & 6), X and + (7 & 8), open and filled circle (9 & 10), open and filled
  inverted triangle (11 & 12), U (13), S (14), circle with vertical line (15),
  thick open circle (16), circle with central dot (17), small dot (18), and
  horizontal line (19).  As of IMOD 4.6.8, the same symbols appear on the
  screen as in the Postscript plots, except that 16 and 17 give open and
  filled circles.  0 will give no symbol; a negative value will produce the
  characters corresponding to the point number for each data value instead of
  a symbol; except that -2 will produce completely filled areas in
  histograms.

  This is an interactive program that allows entries of one option after
  another for plotting data in different ways.  In many cases, you may find it
  much more convenient to use Onegenplot(1), which displays a single X/Y plot 
  of one or more data types or columns specified with command line arguments,
  then exits when the window is closed. 

  Entries to the Genhstplt are:

  0 for plots in the graphics window, 1 for plots only on the terminal, or -1
     for plots always in the graphics window (default -1).  If you enter -1,
     this question will not be asked again and BSPLT will not ask about doing
     terminal plots either.  Note that if you need to use terminal plots, you
     will need to specify that option each time that you do a plot.
  
  0 if there are just data values, or 1 if there are also types, or -1 to have
     columns converted into types (default 0)
  
  Number of columns of data values (excluding the optional types).
     Enter -1 to have the number of columns detected automatically (the
     default), 0 if the number of columns is to be read just before the
     data, or enter the number of columns.
  
  Number of lines to skip at start of file.  Do not count the line telling the
     number of columns, if there is one and you just entered 0 to the last
     question.
  
  Data file name
  
  IF you entered -1 to have columns converted into types, and there is more
  than one column, next enter the column to be placed into the first column in
  the rearranged data.

  IF there are types, next enter:

     Number of groups.  Enter the negative of the number if there is
        only one type per group, as a shortcut.

     IF you entered a positive number, then enter for each group:

        Number of types in group, symbol number
        The type values for the types in the group
  
     BUT IF you entered a negative number, then enter for each group
        the type value and the symbol number
  
  IF there are no type values, just enter the symbol number to be used.
  
  Next enter the column number of the data to be examined next.
  
  Next specify how the data are scaled:
     To leave the data alone, enter 0,0
     To take the logarithm after adding some base amount to the data, enter 1
        and the base amount
     If the data are already logarithms, enter -1,0
  
  The program now enters BSHST, which you can skip through if desired.
  
  You are now at an option point, which you may return to repeatedly
  while running the program.  Your choices are:
  
     1 to examine a new data column, first saving the current column as
        the "previous" column
     2 or 17 to enter BSPLT and plot the column just examined as a set of Y
        values versus the previous column, as a set of X values.  With 17,
        successive points in a group will be connected by lines.
     3 to plot the column just examined versus the previous column,
        first grouping points within each group on the basis of their
        X values and forming means and standard deviations within
        groups (see below)
     4 to loop back and define new groups and/or symbols
     5 to loop back to the start of the program and open a new file
     6 to plot the current Postscript file on workstation screen
     7 or 209 to plot the current Postscript file on printer
     8 or -123 to exit the program
     9 to plot the column just examined versus the previous column as
        series of Tukey box plots, one Tukey box per group.
     10 to plot values with error bars based on S.D. values in another
        column of the data file.
     11 to group points based upon their X values in the previous
       column (as in option 3) and then divide the average of the
       current column by the average of some other column
     12 to select subsets of the data based on the values in some
        other column than the ones being plotted
     13 to divide the current data column by another column
     14 to examine a new data column while retaining the existing X values,
        i.e., without copying the current column into the "previous" column
     15 to reorganization data without types to have one type per column, or
        to restore data from this reorganization
     16 to create an ordinal column, with values from 1 to the number of
        points in a group for each group
  
  If you select option 3, you first choose whether to plot error bars
  as a multiple of standard deviation or standard error of the mean,
  or as confidence limits.  Enter a positive number to get bars equal
  to that number of S.D.'s, or a negative value to get bars equal to
  that number of S.E.M.'s, or a positive number greater than 30 to get
  confidence limits at that percentage level (e.g., 90 for 90%
  confidence limits).  Then, for each group of types, you will be told
  how many data points there are.  Enter the number of groupings that
  you want to combine these points into, then enter the number of
  points to include in each of the groupings, or just a / to divide
  the points equally among the groupings.  If you enter individual
  numbers for each grouping, they should add up to the total number of
  points in that group of types.

  If you select option 9, then when the data are plotted on the
  printer, they will appear as Tukey box plots for each group.
  Each such box shows the median and 25 and 50 percentile values of the
  set of Y values for the group; lines and ticks show the 10 and 90
  percentile points, and symbols are plotted for any data values
  outside the 10 and 90 percentile levels.  The box is plotted at the
  mean X coordinate of the points in the group.
  
  If you select option 10, you first choose whether to plot error bars
  as a multiple of standard deviation or standard error of the mean,
  or as confidence limits.  Enter a positive number to get bars equal
  to that number of S.D.'s, or a negative value to get bars equal to
  that number of S.E.M.'s, or a positive number greater than 30 to get
  confidence limits at that percentage level (e.g., 90 for 90%
  confidence limits).  If you select S.D.'s, next enter the column
  number in the data file that contains the S.D.'s.  Otherwise, enter
  two column numbers: the one with the S.D.'s and one with N's.  Both
  of these parameters are needed to plot S.E.M.'s or confidence limits.
  
  If you select option 11, you first enter a value for error bars as
  in option 3.  Then enter the column to divide the current column by.
  Then specify the groupings of points for each group of data.  The
  default groupings will have nearly equal SUMS for the denominators.
  The program will compute and print out for each set of points the
  following values: mean of previous column (X), mean of current
  column, SD of current column, mean of denominator column, mean of
  current divided by mean of denominator column (Y), SD of current
  divided by mean of denominator (SD associated with Y), and number
  of points in the set.  Error bars based on the resulting SD values
  may or may not be meaningful depending on the nature of the data.

  If you select option 12, first enter the number of the column that
  will be used to test whether to include data.  Then enter a lower
  and upper limit to a range of values, plus either 0 to include only
  values in that range, or 1 to exclude values in that range.  Use this
  option repeatedly to enter multiple selection criteria.  Data points
  will have to meet all of the criteria to be included in the plots.
  After entering one or more selection criteria, you must select data
  by specifying columns with option 1.  To cancel all of the criteria,
  specify option 12 and enter 0 for the column.

  If you select option 13, first enter the number of the column to divide by,
  then enter lower and upper limits for the quotient, or 0,0 not to limit the
  quotient.  The current data column is not replaced, so you can use this
  option repeatedly to divide the current data column by different other
  columns.

  Option 16 is useful for graphing a sequence of values when the data file
  does not contain a column suitable for the X axis.  This option will create
  numbers in the current column from 1 up to the number of items in each
  group .  You will then have to use option 1 to select a new column for the Y
  axis, and the ordinal values will be moved into the "previous" column to
  serve as the X axis.

  There are several additional options used by Onegenplot(1):

     -2 Enter X axis label and symbol key strings.  Follow with the X axis
         label or blank for none, then with the number of key strings (between
         0 and 8), then with the key strings on separate lines
     -3 Invert display contrast to be black lines on white background
     -8 Wait until graph window is closed then exit
