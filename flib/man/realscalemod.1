  REALSCALEMOD will take a model and rescale it into microns.
  It will adjust not only for pixel size and section thickness but
  also for any tilts during microscopy.
  
  If the sections were significantly tilted during microscopy, the
  program can adjust for these tilts given the proper information.
  Prepare a file in which the first line shows the Z value and the
  tilt of the first tilted section (or of the first section, if that
  one was tilted), and each successive line shows the Z value and tilt
  for each section on which tilt was changed.  Z values should occur in
  ascending order.

  Entries to the program are:
  
  Name of model file to be scaled
  
  Name of output file in which to place scaled model
  
  Name of file with tilt information, or Return if none
  
  IF the model has no scaling information in its header, also make the
  following three entries:

     Magnification of negatives (without any commas)
  
     Scale, in microns per pixel, at which negatives were digitized
  
     Section thickness in nanometers
