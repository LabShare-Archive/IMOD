  BOXSTARTEND will clip out volumes of image centered on the starting
  or ending points of model contours.  Each section in such a volume is
  saved as a separate piece of image.  The program can generate two
  lists of piece coordinates to allow the volumes to be examined in
  two different ways.  One list will assemble all of the
  volumes into a single square array, with the extracted starting or
  ending points all appearing on the same section.  The other list will
  display each piece in its true position in the original volume of
  images.
  
  Entries to program:
  
  Image file name
  Piece list file name, if image file is a montage
  Model file name
  
  0 to take the coordinates in the model as they are, or 1 to transform
      the coordinates by a set of transformations, or -1 to
      back-transform the coordinates.  The latter would be used to
      take coordinates from an aligned model and clip out images from
      unaligned images.
  
  IF you entered -1 or 1 for transformed coordinates, next enter the
     name of the file with the transforms.  The first transform in the
     file should correspond to the first section in the file.

  Minimum and maximum X, and minimum and maximum Y index coordinates
     within which starting or ending points must be contained in order
     for them to be clipped out, or / for no limits on coordinates
  
  Minimum and maximum section numbers within which the clipped out
     volumes must be contained, or / for no limits on section number
  
  List of numbers of objects containing contours whose endpoints
     should be selected, or Return for all objects.  Ranges may be
     entered, e.g. 1-3,6.

  0 to clip out starting points, or 1 to clip out ending points.
  
  Size of box, in pixels
  
  Number of sections before endpoint to clip out, and number of
     sections after endpoint to clip out
  
  Name of output file for images

  Name of output file in which to place a list of piece coordinates in
     order to view the pieces in a square array, or Return for no
     file of such coordinates
  
  IF you specify a file name, next enter the amount of blank space to
     leave between adjacent pieces, in pixels
  
  Name of output file in which to place a list of the true, original
     coordinates of each piece, or Return for no such file
