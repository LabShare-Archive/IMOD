  BOXSTARTEND will clip out volumes of image centered on the starting
  or ending points of model contours, or on all points in a model
  contour.  It can place each volume into a separate file, or stack all
  the extracted volumes into a single output file.  In the latter
  case, the program can generate two lists of piece coordinates to
  allow the volumes to be examined in two different ways.  One list
  will assemble all of the volumes into a single square array, with
  the extracted starting or ending points all appearing on the same
  section.  The other list will display each piece in its true
  position in the original volume of images.
  
  Entries to program:
  
  Image file name
  Piece list file name, if image file is a montage
  Model file name
  
  0 to take the coordinates in the model as they are, or 1 to transform
      the coordinates by a set of transformations, or -1 to
      back-transform the coordinates.  The latter would be used to
      take coordinates from an aligned model and clip out images from
      unaligned images.
  
  IF you entered -1 or 1 for transformed coordinates, next enter the
     name of the file with the transforms.  The first transform in the
     file should correspond to the first section in the file.

  Minimum and maximum X, and minimum and maximum Y index coordinates
     within which starting or ending points must be contained in order
     for them to be clipped out, or / for no limits on coordinates
  
  Minimum and maximum section numbers within which the clipped out
     volumes must be contained, or / for no limits on section number
  
  List of numbers of objects containing contours whose endpoints
     should be selected, or Return for all objects.  Ranges may be
     entered, e.g. 1-3,6.

  0 to clip out starting points, or 1 to clip out ending points, or -1
     to clip out all points.
  
  Size of box, in pixels
  
  Number of sections before endpoint to clip out, and number of
     sections after endpoint to clip out
  
  0 to output all images into a single file, or 1 to output each
     box into a separate, numbered file
  
  IF you entered 1 for separate files, next enter the root name for the
     numbered files.  This is then the last entry.  IF you entered 0
     for a single file, then make the following additional entries:

  Name of output file for images

  Name of output file in which to place a list of piece coordinates in
     order to view the pieces in a square array, or Return for no
     file of such coordinates
  
  IF you specify a file name, next enter the amount of blank space to
     leave between adjacent pieces, in pixels
  
  Name of output file in which to place a list of the true, original
     coordinates of each piece, or Return for no such file
