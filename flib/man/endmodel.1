  ENDMODEL will make a new model file containing only specified
  starting and ending points of contours in a model.  The colors of
  the new model objects may be completely different from the colors of
  the original objects.
  
  For data coming from a WIMP model file, the IMOD object number is
  the 256 minus the WIMP color (e.g., object 1 for color 255).  WIMP
  objects that are turned off may be referred to by the negative of
  this object number.
  
  Entries to the program:
  
  Name of input model file
  
  Name of output model file
  
  Number of different objects to create in the output
  model.  For each such object, next enter the following two lines:
  
     Color of the object in the output model, and number of kinds of
     ends to include in that object.  (For example, "250,4" to include
     four kinds of ends in an object colored 250)
  
     A list of pairs of values: each pair consists of an object number
     in the old model, and either a 0 to take the starting point or a 1
     to take the ending point for each contour in that object.  (For
     example, to take starting points of contours in objects 1 and 3,
     and ending points of contours in objects 2 and 4, enter the list
     "1,0,3,0,2,1,4,1" )
  
  Number of points to generate for each new model contour, and the
  increment in Z between them.  If you need this model just to look at,
  enter "1,0" to get just a single point.  If you intend to run an MTK
  analysis of 3-D distances between these ends, you need at least 2
  points; in this case enter "2,0.1"
