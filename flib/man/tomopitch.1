  TOMOPITCH  analyes simple models of the boundaries of the section
  in slices from a tomogram and recommends how much to change
  tilt angles to make the section flat, how much to shift the tilt
  axis in Z to produce centered slices, and how thick to make the
  slices.  It can also recommend how much X-axis tilt is needed to
  make the section flat in the orthogonal direction as well.
  
  For each sample of the tomogram, make a model file with two contours
  in it.  Each contour should have two points, with the line between
  them lying along the top or bottom surface of the section.  The
  points do not have to be entered in any particular order, and the
  lines do not need to be any particular length (the program will
  extend them in X, if necessary, to within 5% of each edge of the
  tomogram).

  As an alternative to making a separate model file for each sample,
  you can load all of the samples into 3dmod together and make a single
  model file, creating a pair of contours at each different time index.
  Make this model file be the sole entry to Tomopitch, and it will
  analyze each if the time indexes separately, the same as if they were
  in separate files.

  The program analyzes the model file for each tomogram sample
  separately.  It  determines what rotation is required to make the
  section be flat.  It reports the upward shift needed to center the
  section in Y, and the slice thickness needed to contain the section.
  These values are derived and reported  before and after the
  recommended rotation is applied.  Thickness values include an
  additional amount that you specify and are rounded up to integers
  suitable for taking 3D FFTs.  After all files are analyzed, the
  program makes the same analysis and report based on the data from
  all of the files.  It then computes an X-axis tilt and reports
  thickness and rotation if that tilt is taken into account as well.
  
  Entries to the program:
  
  Additional pixels of thickness to add to both the top and the bottom
  of the tomogram, beyond the region described by the model lines.

  Spacing between tomogram samples (the distance in Y in the tilt 
  images.)  If a non-zero number is entered, the program will
  compute the tilt around the X-axis that will make the tomogram be
  flat in its Z dimension.

  Number of model files to analyze
  
  For each file, then enter the name of the file.
