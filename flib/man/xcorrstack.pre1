  XCORR cross-correlates each of the sections in one image stack with a single
  image in a second image file.  A subset of sections may be done. The
  correlation may be filtered with the same set of parameters as in other IMOD
  programs (see man page for Enhance(1)).  The single image may be smaller
  than the images in the stack.  In this case, by default the single image
  will be placed in an array of the larger size, with the MIDDLE of the
  smaller image moved to the LOWER-LEFT corner of the larger array.  As a
  consequence of this shift, the coordinates of the peaks in the correlation
  will correspond to the coordinates of the centers of features in the image
  stack that best match the single image.  If the single image and stack have
  the same dimensions, then you have a choice as to whether to keep the single
  image as it is or to move its middle into the lower left corner.
  Displacements between images would then be reflected by the positions of
  peaks in the correlogram relative to the (0,0) pixel (if the image is not
  shifted) or relative to the middle (NX/2,NY/2) pixel (if the image is
  shifted.)

  Images will be padded if necessary for taking the FFT, so their size may be
  odd or contain large prime factors.

  Filtering is specified with the standard four parameters used in other IMOD
  programs.  The filter functions produced by these options can be visualized
  with the program Filterplot(1); see that man page a full description of
  their effects.

  Xcorrstack uses the PIP package for input exclusively (see the manual page
  for pip(1)).  The following options can be specified either as command line
  arguments (with the -) or one per line in a command file or parameter file
  (without the -):
