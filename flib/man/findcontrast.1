  FINDCONTRAST finds the black and white contrast settings that are
  used when converting an image file to bytes with newstack or mrcbyte.
  It computes a histogram of pixel values within a selected volume,
  which it uses to determine the contrast settings that would truncate
  the values of a specified, small number of pixels in the volume.
  
  The program is designed to be used with newly-created tomograms,
  so coordinates are entered as they would be observed in a flipped
  volume, with Y and Z transposed.
  
  The program reports the absolute minimum and maximum pixel values
  within the selected volume, the minimum and maximum values with
  truncation of the specified number of pixels, and the black and white
  contrast settings that would give this amount of truncation.

  
  Entries to the program:
  
  Name of image file
  
  First and last slice to include in the volume to be analyzed.  The
  first slice is numbered 1, so the numbers entered can be the 
  3dmod section #'s in a flipped volume.
  
  Lower and upper X coordinates, and lower and upper Y coordinates,
  of the volume to analyze, as viewed in a flipped volume.  Enter /
  for the default, which omits a 10% border on each side.
  
  Maximum number of pixels to truncate (saturate) at black and at
  white within the analyzed volume.  Enter / for the default, which
  is one pixel per slice or one pixel per million, whichever is 
  greater.
