  This program will smooth a surface defined by model contours,
  adjusting the positions of points in each contour as needed.  At each
  point on the surface, it fits a 3-D polynomial to all points within
  a defined range of Z-levels and within a specified distance of the
  central point.  That point's position is then replaced by the fitted
  position from the polynomial.  After this surface smoothing
  operation, each contour is independently smoothed by local fitting to
  2-D (ordinary) polynomials.
  
  Inputs to the program:
  
  Name of input model file
  
  Name of output model file
  
  List of IMOD objects to smooth, or Return to smooth all objects.
  Ranges may be entered, e.g. 1-3,7,9-11.

  Order of 3-D polynomials to fit to the surface.  Note that a second-
  order polynomial has 5 terms and a third-order has 9 terms.  The
  polynomial should not have too high an order for the number of points
  being fit.
  
  Number of levels in Z (i.e., number of different contours) to
  include in the fit.
  
  Limiting distance in 3-D for points to be included in the fit.
  
  Polynomial order for smoothing of individual contours, or zero to
  omit this smoothing.
  
  NOTE: The program has not been tested with a variety of models.  With
  the particular models tested so far, good results were obtained with 
  third-order 3-D polynomials fitted to 7 levels in Z and including
  points within a distance of 15 pixels.  Order 2 was good for
  smoothing of individual contours.
