 	  This program will do 2-dimensional FFT's in either
 	direction. The real-space origin is at (1,1) and
 	the origin of reciprocal space is at (1,NY/2+1).
 	The FT of an image NX,NY is NX/2+1,NY complex value.

 	  All transforms are done using Lynn ten Eyck's subroutines.
 	These allow arbitrary-sized images having a LARGEST PRIME
 	factor of 19!!.

 	Very large images (upto 8192 x 8192) are transformed using
 	the disk-based routine BIGFFT. The switch point is now
 	determined by the available working set size (small images
 	are done in core)

 	NOTE:  3-D images are treated as image stacks.
 	  Each section is transformed independently!!
 	  HOWEVER, only single sections of LARGE images may be used!

        The program will accept file names either from the command line
        or as entries to the program after it is started.  If there are
        two names on the command line, they will be taken as the input
        and output file names; if there is one name, it will be taken
        as the input file name and the program will ask for the output
        file name; if there are no command line arguments, the program
        will ask for both input and output file names.

 	No input parameters are required.

 	Should work with any input data mode but backward FFT will
 	be in real*4 mode (2) -DNM

 	DNM modified to do in "memory" rather than use giantfft as long as
 	the image will actually fit into the dimensioned array.  Also, changed
 	to properly package arrays in memory and use iwrsec to write sections;
 	this is much faster and saves lots of disk access.
