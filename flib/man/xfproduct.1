  XFPRODUCT  is used to concatenate two lists of transforms, or to
  multiply all of the transforms in one file by another transform.

  In the first case, for each line in the input files, it multiplies
  the transform in the first input file by the transform in the second
  file, and writes the product in the output file.  This can thus be
  used to implement two stage alignment: If the first set of
  transforms were obtained by a first stage of aligning raw images,
  and the second set are obtained by a second stage of alignment
  applied to images that have been aligned by the first set, then the
  products produced by this program can be applied to the raw images,
  in one step, to produce an alignment that incorporates both stages.
  
  To multiply all of the transforms in one file by a single transform,
  make the latter transform be the only one in a file.  The file with
  the single transform can be either the first or the second file.
