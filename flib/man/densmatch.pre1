  Densmatch scales the density values in one volume so that its mean
  and standard deviation match that of another volume.  To determine
  the mean and S.D. for each volume, it samples up to 100000 pixels in
  the central eighth of each volume (central half in X, Y, and Z).  It
  can write the scaled values either to a new file or back into the
  file of the volume being scaled.  THE LATTER WILL DESTROY THE
  ORIGINAL VALUES IN THAT FILE.
  
  Densmatch uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for pip(1))
  and can still take sequential input interactively, but with no options.
  The following options can be specified either as command line arguments
  (with the -) or one per line in a command file or parameter file (without
  the -):

INSERT OPTION TEXT HERE

  -StandardInput
     Read parameter entries from standard input.


  If there are no command-line arguments, Densmatch takes sequential input
  the old way, with the following entries:
  
  Name of the first volume, the one whose densities are being matched
  
  Name of the second volume, the one being scaled
  
  Name of an output file, or a blank line to have the scaled values
  written back into the second file.
