 This program will extract subsections from a symmetrical	
 object and create a stack of normalized subsections as the	
 output. It works best when used upon a symmetrical object	
 such as an axoneme cross-section.				
 The input requirements are:					
	1) An image file containing 1 or more sections		
	2) A point file ( corresponding to (1) ) containing	
	   a point at the center of every subsection to be	
	   extracted.						
	3) A point file ( corresponding to (1) ) containing	
	   all of the points used to determine the section	
	   center.						
 The program requires that the dimensions of the subsection	
 box be give as the edge lengths of the box.  An additional	
 subsection rotation may be specified.  The output will be	
 an image file containing all of the normalized subsections.
