  WARPVOL will transform a volume using a series of general linear
  transformations. Its main use is to "warp" one tomogram from
  a two-axis tilt series so that it matches the other tomogram.
  For each position in the volume, it interpolates between adjacent
  adjacent transformations to find the transformation appropriate for
  that position.  Any initial alignment transformation (from
  SOLVEMATCH) must be already contained in the transformations entered
  into this program; this combining of transformations is accomplished
  by FINDWARP.  It can work with either a 2-D matrix of
  transformations (varying in X and Z) or with a general 3-D matrix,
  as output by FINDWARP.  The program uses the same algorithm as
  ROTATEVOL for rotating large volumes.

  INPUTS to the program:
  
  Name of the input file to be transformed

  Name of the output file for the transformed volume

  Path name of directory (for example, /usr/tmp) where temporary files
     can be placed, or Return to have files placed in the current
     directory

  X, Y, and Z dimensions of the output file, or / to accept the default
     values, which are NZ, NY, and NX of the input volume (a 90-degree
     rotation about the Y axis)
  
  Name of the file with the matrix of inverse transformations
     (produced by FINDWARP)
