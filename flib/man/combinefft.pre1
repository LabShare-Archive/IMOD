  Combinefft combines the FFTs from the two tomograms of a double-axis
  tilt series, taking into account the tilt range of each tilt series
  and the transformation used to match one tomogram to the other.  For
  a location in Fourier space where there is data from one tilt series
  but not the other, it takes the Fourier value from just the one
  appropriate FFT; everywhere else it averages the Fourier values from
  the two FFT files.

  There is an option (-reduce) to reduce amplitudes in regions of the FFT
  derived from only one tomogram to match the reduction in amplitudes in
  regions where data were averaged.  Apparently, the averaged data have lower
  amplitudes when there is substantial noise in the reconstruction because
  some of the noise averages out, while the noise in regions derived from one
  tomogram is unattenuated.  This may result in directionally patterned noise.
  The reduction option will reduce the noise (and signal) in the regions
  derived from one tomogram in attempt to keep it from dominating over the
  rest of the data.

  There is an option (-weight) for more sophisticated weighting that gives
  worse results with test data.

  Combinefft uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for pip(1))
  and can take input interactively for options that existed when it was
  converted, to maintain compatibility with old command files.  The
  following options can be specified either as command line arguments (with
  the -) or one per line in a command file or parameter file (without 
  the -):

INSERT OPTION TEXT HERE

  -StandardInput
     Read parameter entries from standard input.


  If the program is started with no command line arguments, it reverts to
  interactive input with the following entries:
  
  File name of FFT of first tomogram (the one matched TO)
  
  File name of FFT of second tomogram (the one produced by MATCHVOL)
  
  Name of output file for resulting FFT, or Return to write into the
      file of the second FFT, overwriting that FFT.
  
  Name of file with inverse of transformation used to match the two
      tomograms (output by MATCHVOL)
  
  For the first tomogram file, either the starting and ending tilt
     angles, or the name of a file with tilt angles in it.  In the
     latter case, the first number on the first line will be taken as
     the starting tilt angle; the first number on the last line will
     be taken as the ending tilt angle.
  
  For the second tomogram file, either the starting and ending tilt
     angles, or the name of a file with tilt angles in it.
