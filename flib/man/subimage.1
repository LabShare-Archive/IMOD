SUBIMAGE will subtract one image from another, or a series of images from one
  file from a series in another file.  It will report the minimum, maximum,
  mean, and standard deviation of each difference image.
  Inputs to the program are:

  Image file A

  List of section numbers for the images from file A; ranges may be entered

  Image file B

  List of corresponding section numbers for the images from file B; again,
        ranges may be entered

  Output file for difference A minus B, or a blank line for no output file,
        if only statistics are desired
