c	  CHECKLIST examines a list of NPCLIST piece coordinates in IXPCLIST
c	  (x or y), applies a reduction factor IREDFAC, and given the frame
c	  size NXFRAME, it finds the minimum coordinate MINXPIECE, the total
c	  pixels NXTOTPIX, the # of pieces NXPIECES, and the overlap NXOVERLAP
c	  It also checks that ALL coordinates on the list are multiples of
c	  frame size minus overlap

     &	    ,nxpieces,nxoverlap)

	integer*4 ixpclist(*)
c
	minxdiff=100000
	minxpiece=100000
	maxxpiece=-100000
c
c	    get min and max of piece coordinates
c
	do i=1,npclist
	  ixpc=iredfac*ixpclist(i)
	  minxpiece=min(minxpiece,ixpc)
	  maxxpiece=max(maxxpiece,ixpc)

c
c	    get difference from minimum; keep track of minimum distance

c	  now check and make sure all differences are multiples of minimum
c	  but if there were no non-zero differences, return 1 piece, 0 overlap

c	      If difference is bigger than frame size, find out how many
c	      frame sizes to add back to difference to make it positive, then
c	      divide positive difference by this # of times to get overlap
c	      THIS WILL FAIL UNDER EXTREME CONDITIONS
