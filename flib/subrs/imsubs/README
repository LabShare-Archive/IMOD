This directory has individual files for all of the subroutines from the
file IMSUBS.FOR under VMS.  It also has the C version for i/o, blockio.c.

C   DNM (mast) August 1988 for HVEM
C   IMPOSN and the READ/WRITE Subroutines have been changed to allow 9 - 15 bit
C   storage mode.  No change in other routines is required.  However, all
C   documentation of MODE for the other routines should be changed to note that
c   a mode of 9 to 15 means 9 to 15 bit storage mode
C
c   A new common block was added (im$bit) with variables bytcur and ibleft.
c   In 9 to 15 bit storage mode, bytcur contains the last byte read from
c   a file, and ibleft is the number of bits (if any) left in that byte
c   that belong to the next pixel.  The rest of the pixel is in the byte
c   pointed to by the read/write pointer.  All positioning within the file,
c   as well as reads and writes, must maintain these values correctly.
c   
c   There are also new routines IREPAK to repack a 2D array into linear
c   storage (so that iwrsec can be called instead of iwrpas), and ISETDN to
c   scale densities appropriately for the storage mode.
c	  DNM 11/18/88 increased file limit to 9, changed definitions of
c	  different data types
c	  DNM 7/24/91 put in an if statement to avoid trying to print filename
c	  when the stream # is > 5, due to error in macro code QINQUIRE
c	  DNM 2/10/92 added ability to read (but not write) SPIDER files,
c	  increased file limit to 10
