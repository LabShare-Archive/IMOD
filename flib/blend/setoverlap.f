c       SETOVERLAP, given the minimum total # of pixels MINTOTPIX and the
c       minimum overlap MINOVERLAP, and the frame dimension NFRAME, and the
c       amount by which frame size can be reduced, IDFRAME, finds
c       the minimum # of pieces needed, NPIECES, the overlap NOVERLAP that
c       minimizes the number of extra pixels, and total # of pixels NTOTPIX
c       Note that if it can be done with a single piece it will return
c       NOVERLAP=MINOVERLAP.
c       
c       NOTE THIS insists on no prime factor
c       greater than 19 so that filtering and FFT's can be done.
