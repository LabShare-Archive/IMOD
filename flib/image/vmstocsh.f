c	  VMSTOCSH takes a VMS-style command file from standard input and
c	  converts it to text suitable for piping to a C shell, on standard
c	  output.  The command file may contain: lines to run programs, which
c	  must be preceded by either a $ or a %; comment lines, preceded by
c	  either $! or #; and entries to the programs that are run, which
c	  follow the line starting the program, just as in a VMS command file.
c	  If a command line to run a program is too long, it may be broken 
c	  into multiple lines by ending each line except the last one with a \.
c	  The continuation lines should not start with a $ or %.
c	  
c	  If there is a command-line argument, that argument will be set up
c	  as a log file: the text output of each command will be directed
c	  into this log file.
c	  
c	  The easiest way to use this program is to define the following
c	  alias in your .cshrc (the ^G should be a control G character there):
c
c	      alias subm 'vmstosh <\!^.com \!^.log |csh ; echo ^G& '
c
c	  With this alias, if your command file is stuff.com, you can give the
c	  command "subm stuff" and the file will be executed in background, a 
c	  log file stuff.log will be created, and the bell will ring when the
c	  job is completed.
