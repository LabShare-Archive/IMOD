<A NAME = "TOP"><H3>Contour Joining</H3></A>

Contour joining will 
make a single contour from two or more separate contours and
remove the old contours.  Basically, one first selects the contours to join and
then presses <B>Apply</B> or the hot key <B>Shift+J</B>.
<P>
There are two ways to select contours to join.  The easiest is to use
multiple contour selection.
First select a model point within the first contour, then select
a point in the second contour with Ctrl and the first mouse
button.  If two or more contours are selected in this way, they will be the
ones joined, regardless of any set points appearing in the dialog box.
The second way is to
select a point in the first contour and press the
<B>Set 1</B> button, then select a point in the second contour and
press <B>Set 2</B>.  The latter step is actually superfluous, because if
only one join point is set and another point is selected as the
current point, that point will be used as the second point.
<P>
How the contours are joined depends on the type of object and the options
selected by the radio buttons.  
<OL>
<LI> For closed contour type objects, the
contours can either be joined by a connecting line or concatenated end to end.
<UL>
<LI>If <B>Concatenate</B> is selected, all of the points from one contour will be
added after all of the points in the other contour, so that the contours will
appear joined at their nearest endpoints. 
<LI>If <B>Join near pts</B> is
selected, a connecting line will be generated between the contours at their
points of closest approach.
<LI>If <B>Auto-choose</B> is selected, the program
will automatically choose between these two approaches based upon whether a
pair of contours have openings at their ends larger than the distance between
their endpoints.
<LI>If <B>Join set pts</B> is selected, two contours will be
joined with a connecting line between the selected points in the contours.
</UL>
Thus, these options give you complete control over the process, but the
default <B>Auto-choose</B> will probably do what you want.

<LI> For open contour type objects, the contours can be concatenated end to
end or spliced at the selected points.
<UL>
<LI>If <B>Concatenate</B> is selected, a
pair of contours will be joined end to end just as described above for closed
contours.
<LI>If <B>Splice set pts</B> is selected, the new contour will contain
points from the first contour up to first set point then points from the
second contour starting at the second set point through the end of the
contour.  Other points are discarded.
</UL>

<LI>For scattered point type objects, all of the points from the selected
contours will be combined into one contour, regardless of
which points are selected.  No points will be discarded.
</OL>
<P>
When more than two contours are selected, the pairs with the least distance
between them are joined first.
<P>
The hot key <B>Shift+J</B> can be used in place of the <B>Apply</B> button.  It can
also be used when the join dialog is not open, when two or more contours are
selected.  The radio box selections will be remembered and applied after the
dialog is closed.
