<H3>Setting Fine Grain Properties</H3>

This window is used to set display properties at a finer level than is
ordinarily allowed.  Properties such as color and line width can be
set for individual points within a contour, for individual contours,
or for specific surfaces.  
<P>
The radio buttons at the top are used to select whether properties are
being shown
and controlled for the current <B>Point</B>, <B>Contour</B>, or
<B>Surface</B>.  For the current item, the various controls show the
existing display properties of that item.  For each property, there
appears the letter <B>D</B> if the property has a default value, or
<B>S</B> if the property has been set.
<P>
The fine grain changes operate somewhat differently for points than
for contours and surfaces.  For points, when a property is set for one
point, its value applies to all following points in the contour until
the change in property is ended, or until a different value is set for
a later point.  Thus, when a property has a non-default value for the
current point, an <B>End</B> button is enabled to allow you to end the
sequence of changes at that point.  In addition, a <B>Clear</B> button
is enabled, which will allow you to reset that property to the default
for the whole contiguous sequence of points that have the property set.
There are two exceptions to this pattern: <B>Gap to next point</B>
applies only to the single point at which it is set, so that one can
create an opening in a contour.  The <B>Mesh Connection #</B> also
applies only to a single point.
<P>
For contours and surfaces, all changes apply only to a single contour
or surface.  Thus, once a property has been set, the <B>Clear</B>
button is enabled to allow you to restore the default value, while the
<B>End</B> button has no function.
<P>
Once you have set a property, the <B>Last</B> button is enabled so
that you can conveniently apply the same change to other items, for
example points in a corresponding position on another contour.
<P>
Most property changes will show up immediately in the image or model
view windows.  However, some of the properties are designed to be
incorporated into the mesh, and you will not see any change in the
display of the mesh until the model is saved, remeshed with imodmesh,
and reloaded.  Indeed, even that won't do any good until imodmesh is
modified to incorporate these changes into the mesh!
<P>
A final general note before descriptions of individual properties: the
ability to make these fine grained changes in the model represents a
big change in the potential content of IMOD models.  Many programs
outside of 3dmod will ignore, discard, or garble this information
until they are modified to handle it properly.  Even some operations
within 3dmod will not deal with the fine grained data correctly,
notably sorting of contours and points, and use of the line tracker.

<LI><B>Line color</B> is the color of lines in image and model views,
and the default color for mesh displays in model view.  Pressing the
<B>Set</B> button opens a standard color selector window.  When the
color is changed in this window, the changes are applied to the
current point or contour, not necessarily to the same item that was
selected when the window was opened.
<LI><B>Fill color</B> is the color used for displaying filled meshes
when the <B>Use fill color</B> option is selected in the fill color
panel of the model view Object Edit window.  For spheres, changes here
will show up immediately when either this option or <B>Use for
spheres</B> is selected; but for other meshed items, the changes will
not show up until incorporated into a mesh.  The <B>Set</B> button
opens a separate color selector window which works like the <B>Line
color</B> window.
<LI><B>Transparency</B> is a property that appears in the model view.
Changes will appear immediately for line or sphere displays but will
have to be incorporated into a new mesh for filled mesh displays.
<LI><B>2D line width</B>, <B>Symbol type</B>, and <B>Symbol size</b>
are properties that appear only in 2d (image) displays and their
default values are set in the 3dmod Object Edit window.
<LI><B>3D line width</B> governs the width of lines displayed in the
model view.
<LI><B>Gap to next point</B> introduces an opening in the contour after
the current point, so that contours can have multiple openings.  When
contour or surface properties are being shown, this button mutates to
<B>Turn off drawing</B>, which lets you turn off an individual contour or
surface.
<LI><B>Mesh connection #</B> will be used to force particular points
in adjacent contours to be connected in a mesh, such as the points at
the start of a gap.  The points to be connected would be assigned the
same unique connection number.
