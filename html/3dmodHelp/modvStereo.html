<H2>3dmodv Stereo Dialog</H2>
<P>
This window provides control over two or three kinds of stereo displays,
depending on whether the graphics hardware supports stereo.  The combo box
allows one to turn a particular kind of stereo on or off, the <B>Angle</B>
slider allows one to adjust the angle of parallax between the two views, and the
<B>Vertical Offset</B> slider allows one to adjust the offset between views in
top/bottom stereo to bring the views into register when the monitor does two
vertical scans per frame.
<DL>
<DT>SIDE-BY-SIDE
<DD>This mode is the default when no internal or external hardware seems to
available.  Some people may find this useful if they can fuse the two images
somehow.
<DT>TOP/BOTTOM
<DD>This mode is designed to be used when the monitor can be set to display the top
and bottom of the display in two successive scans.  When you activate this mode,
the model view window will be stretched to the full height of the screen and the
model will be shown in the top and bottom of this window.  After you switch the
monitor to display two scans, adjust the vertical offset slider until the two
images coincide.  Once you have determined this offset, you can define an
environment variable IMOD_STEREO_TBOFFSET to have this value, and this offset
will be applied automatically in the future.
<DT>HARDWARE
<DD>This mode is available only if the display hardware supports left and right
stereo buffers in OpenGL.  When the mode is activated, the command defined in
the environment variable IMOD_STEREO_COMMAND is executed.  The two images are
then drawn into the left and right buffers.  When the mode is turned off, the
command defined in the environment variable IMOD_STEREO_RESTORE is executed.
This mode is known to work only on an SGI, where the proper specialized calls
are made to use the stereo buffers, and the proper commands are built in to call
setmon and change the monitor mode.
</DL>
<H3>Hot Keys</H3>
Stereo is toggled with the [s] hot key.  The first time this is used, the
program will go into Top/Bottom mode if IMOD_STEREO_TBOFFSET is defined,
otherwise into Hardware mode if stereo buffers are available, otherwise into
Side-by-side mode.
