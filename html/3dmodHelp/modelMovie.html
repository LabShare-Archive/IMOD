<H3>Model Movie & Montage Control</H3>
<H4>Movie Making</H4>
The upper controls make a movie by stepping through 
from the values in the left column of text boxes (starting values) to 
the values in the right column (ending values).
<P>
Press the <B>Set Start</B> button to set the starting values to the 
values of the current display, or the <B>Set End</B> button to set 
the ending values.  You can also edit the values.
<P>
If the model view window is opened from 3dmod, then text boxes will 
appear for starting and ending image slices in X, Y, and Z.  These 
values will be relevant if you use the <B>Edit-Image</B> dialog to turn on 
display of image slices in the model view window.  There are also boxes 
showing the transparency of the image display and the thickness, or 
number of slices displayed.
<P>
Pressing the <B>Make</B> button will cause 3dmodv to 
display the number of frames given.  The rotation between the 
starting and ending positions will be resolved into a rotation 
around a single axis, and the rotation will occur at even 
increments around that axis.
<P>
Press the <B>Stop</B> button to stop after the next display.
<P>
If <B>Write Files</B> is selected then a snapshot will 
be taken of each image.  The file will be a TIFF file or in the primary or
second non-TIFF format, depending on which radio button is selected.  The
default non-TIFF formats should be JPEG and PNG.  To change the format of the
primary non-TIFF option, use the menu entry <B>Edit-Options</B> and
go to the <B>Behavior</B> panel.  The second option will be PNG if the first
one is not PNG, or JPEG if the first one is PNG.
<P>
To make a movie through 360 degrees around the X or the Y axis, 
select the <B>Full 360 X</B> or <B>Full 360 Y</B> button.  Then select the 
<B>Make</B> button.  The number of frames can be set before or 
after selecting a <B>Full 360</B> button.  Pressing <B>Set Start</B> or 
<B>Set End</B> will cancel the <B>Full 360</B> selection.
<P>
If <B>Reverse</B> is selected, the movie will run in reverse, from 
the ending to the starting position, or rotate in the opposite 
direction for a <B>Full 360</B> movie.
<P>
If <B>Long way</B> is selected, the rotation will go the long way 
around, through an angle greater instead of less than 180 
degrees.
<P>
<H4>Montage Making</H4>
The lower controls allow one to save a montage of zoomed-up views 
of the model into a single TIFF or non-TIFF file, in order to get a 
high-resolution rendering of the model.  The model will be zoomed up by a 
factor equal to the number of montage frames, then translated to a 
regular array of positions.  When you press <B>Make</B>, images will be
montaged into an array that is saved into a file of the selected type at the
end (it is not necessary to select <B>Write Files</B>).  Perspective must be
set to zero in order for this to work correctly.
<P>
The Snapshot tab of the Preferences dialog has an option to set the resolution
(in dots per inch) of snapshots saved as TIFF or JPEG.  There is also an
option to have this resolution scaled up when taking a montage, so that a
montaged image will display at the same size as a single-frame snapshot in
programs that pay attention to the resolution.
