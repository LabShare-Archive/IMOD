<DT><B>Current model #</B> spin box
<DD>Multiple models can be loaded with 3dmodv, either on the command line or
through the <B>File</B> menu.  To page through the different models use the
<B>Current model #</B> spin box or the [9] and [0] hot keys.
<DT><B>Move</B> radio buttons
<DD>The <B>Move</B> radio buttons allow one to choose between having actions
move just the current model, <B>One</B>, or having actions move <B>All</B> of
the models.
<DT><B>Edit</B> radio buttons
<DD>The <B>Edit</B> radio buttons toggle between editing just the current model,
<B>One</B>, and editing <B>All</B> of the models for each model edit.  This can
include editing done in the <B>Edit Objects</B> and <B>Edit Controls</B> menus.
<P>
In the <B>Edit Objects</B> menu, numerous features can be changed in tandem
for the same object in all models, or even for all objects in all models.  These
include: material properties, transparency, point size, line width, the drawing
data type and style, object color, and whether objects are on or off.
<P>
In the <B>Edit Controls</B> menu, the clipping planes and perspective can be
changed together, and typing a value into the <B>Scale</B> box will set all
models to the same scale.  If the zoom is changed with arrow buttons or hot
keys, all models will change their zoom by the same amount.
<DT><B>View</B> selection box
<DD>The <B>View</B> selection box allows one to choose between viewing just the
current model, viewing the current model and the previous model, viewing the
current model and the next model, or viewing all of the models.  The [8] hot key
toggles between viewing one and viewing all models.
<DT><B>Internal name</B>
<DD>The <B>Internal name</B> text box allows you to enter a name that is stored
in the Imod model, separate from the filename.
<DT><B>Pixel size</B>
<DD>The <B>Pixel size</B> text box allows you to set the pixel size of the
model, which is needed for extracting quantitative information.  Enter a number
then the units of measurement.  Available units are km, m, cm, um, nm, A, and pm.
