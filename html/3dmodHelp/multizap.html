<title>Multi-Z Window</title>
</head>
<A NAME = "TOP"><H2>Multi-Z Window Controls</H2></A>
The Multi-Z window is a special form of Zap window that can display the same
area from successive
slices in an array of panels.  Z increases from left to right within a row and
then
from bottom to top in the window.  The current Z value is shown in the middle
panel of the array (for an even number of panels, the middle panel number is
the number of panels divided by two, so it is below or to the left of the
window center).
Panels outside the range of available slices are left blank.
The window first opens with a single row of
5 panels, but parameters such as the number of rows and columns and
the window size and location will be remembered between invocations of 3dmod.
The window retains as much of the Zap window functionality as makes
sense, but many features do not exist.  For example, there is no rubber band,
modeling is not allowed, and contrast floating cannot be based on subareas.

<H3>Mouse Button Assignments</H3>
Descriptions below refer to the first, second, and third mouse 
buttons.  By default, these correspond to left, middle, and right 
buttons of a 3-button mouse, but you can change these assignments in 
the 3dmod Preferences dialog, accessed via the <B>Edit-Options</B> menu entry.


<H3>The Regular Zap Tool Bars</H3>
<UL>
<LI>The <B>up</B> and <B>down arrows</B> step the zoom factor up or down.
<LI>The <B>zoom</B> edit box shows the current zoom factor and allows 
one to type in a custom zoom.
<LI>The <B>checkerboard</B> button toggles between fast rendering and 
slower but higher quality interpolated image rendering.
<LI>The <B>lock</B> button can lock the Multi-Z window at the current Z value.
When locked, the Z value of a Multi-Z window can be changed with 
controls or hot keys in the window, but that will not change the current
Z value of other windows in the program.
<LI>The <B>centering</B> button toggles between two modes of centering when
the window is redrawn in response to various actions such as changing the
current point.  The default is
to recenter the image only when the current model point comes near an edge.
In centering mode, the image will be kept centered
on either the current model point or the current image point.  
If you want to get the current point centered in the window without staying in
centering mode, you can just toggle this button on and off.
<LI>The <B>Z slider</B> allows one to riffle through images or select a 
particular section to display in the middle panel.
<LI>The <B>section</B> edit box shows the current section shown in the middle
panel and allows one 
to go directly to a section by typing in a number.
<LI>If multiple image files have been loaded into 3dmod, three 
additional controls and the image file number and name appear on a separate
tool bar.  The <B>time lock</B> button will prevent 
changes in other windows from changing the time (image file) 
displayed in this Multi-Z window, and vice versa. 
The <B>left</B> and <B>right arrows</B> will step backward and forward in time.
</UL>

<H3>The Multi-Z Tool Bar</H3>
<UL>
<LI>The <B># X</B> spin box allows you to set the number of columns of panels,
i.e., the number in the X direction.
<LI>The <B># Y</B> spin box allows you to set the number of rows of panels,
i.e., the number in the Y direction.
<LI>The <B>Z step</B> spin box allows you to set the interval in Z between
successive panels.
<LI>The <B>Middle</B> check box controls whether the model is drawn in the
middle panel.
<LI>The <B>Others</B> check box controls whether the model is drawn in
panels other than the middle.
</UL>

<H3>Hot Keys special to the Multi-Z window</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>Ctrl-S</B>, <B>Shift-S</B> or <B>Ctrl-Shift-S</B> saves the Multi-Z
window into a TIFF file, a file in the primary
non-TIFF format, or a file in the second non-TIFF format.  (Use the menu entry 
<B>Edit-Options</B> and go to the Behavior tab to select the primary non-TIFF
file format.  The second non-TIFF format will be PNG if the primary one is not
PNG, or JPEG if the primary one is PNG.)
<LI><B>ESC</B> will close the Multi-Z window.
</UL>
For other keys, see Help - Hot Keys in the 3dmod Info Window.


<H3>Mouse button function in movie mode</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>First Button Click</B>: Select the current viewing point, marked by 
a small cross.  In addition, clicking in a panel other than the middle one
changes the current Z value and moves that image to the middle window.
<LI><B>First Button Drag</B>: Pan the image if it is larger than the 
panel.
<LI><B>Second Button Click</B>: Start movie in forward direction, or stop movie.
<LI><B>Third Button Click</B>: Start movie in backward direction, or stop movie.
</UL>

<H3>Mouse button function in model mode</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>First Button Click</B>: Make the nearest visible model point be the 
current model point.  If there is no point nearby, this detaches from 
the current point and contour and selects a current viewing point 
instead.  Again, clicking in a panel other than the middle one changes the
current Z value.
<LI><B>First Button Drag</B>: Pan the image if it is larger than the 
panel.
<LI><B>Ctrl - First Button Click</B>: Selects the nearest visible point 
as the current point but also adds this contour to a list of selected 
contours.  Selected contours in this list will be 
displayed with a distinguishable line thickness.  If a contour is 
already selected, Ctrl-clicking on it will deselect it.  The 
selection list is cleared by doing an ordinary first button selection 
of any model point, or by a variety of other operations, mostly ones 
that select a different contour from the current one.  Contours from more
than one object can be selected with this button.
<LI><B>Ctrl - First Button Drag</B>: Adds any contours that the mouse crosses 
to the list of selected contours.  Contours from more
than one object can be selected this way.  As soon as a contour is selected in
a panel other than the middle one, that image is moved to the middle panel.
This could be either useful or surprising.
