<H3>Mouse Button Assignments</H3>
Descriptions below refer to the first, second, and third mouse 
buttons.  By default, these correspond to left, middle, and right 
buttons of a 3-button mouse, but you can change these assignments in 
the 3dmod Preferences dialog, accessed via the <B>Edit-Options</B> menu entry.

<LI>The <B>up</B> and <B>down arrows</B> step the zoom factor up or down.
<LI>The <B>zoom</B> edit box shows the current zoom factor and allows 
one to type in a custom zoom.
<LI>The <B>size</B> indicator shows the current window size, or the window
pixels enclosed by the rubber band if it is on.  This is the size of image that
will be produced when taking a snapshot.
<LI>The <B>checkerboard</B> button toggles between fast rendering and 
slower but higher quality interpolated image rendering.
<LI>The <B>lock</B> button can lock the Zap window at the current Z value.
When locked, the Z value of a Zap window can be changed with 
controls or hot keys in the window, but that will not change the current
Z value of other windows in the program.
<LI>The <B>centering</B> button toggles between having the image always 
centered 
on the current model point, and recentering the image only when 
the current point comes near an edge (the default).
<LI>The <B>modeling direction</B> button toggles between inserting new 
points after the current point (when pointing up) or before 
the current point (when pointing down).
<LI>The <B>rubber band</B> button turns the rubber band on or off (see
<B>B</B> hot key below).
<LI>The <B>Z slider</B> allows one to riffle through images or select a 
particular section to display.
<LI>The <B>section</B> edit box shows the current section and allows one 
to go directly to a section by typing in a number.
<LI>The <B>I</B> button brings the Information Window to the 
front and prints information about window and image size (see the 
<B>I</B> hot key below).
<LI>If multiple image files have been loaded into 3dmod, three 
additional controls and the image file number and name appear on a separate
tool bar.  The <B>time lock</B> button will prevent 
changes in other windows from changing the time (image file) 
displayed in this Zap window, and vice-versa.  
The <B>left</B> and <B>right arrows</B> will 
step backward and forward in time.

<LI><B>i</B> toggles the modeling direction.
<LI><B>Ctrl-S</B>, <B>Shift-S</B> or <B>Ctrl-Shift-S</B> saves the Zap window,
or the area inside the rubber band, into a TIFF file, a file in the primary
non-TIFF format, or a file in the second non-TIFF format.  (Use the menu entry 
<B>Edit-Options</B> and go to the Behavior tab to select the primary non-TIFF
file format.  The second non-TIFF format will be PNG if the primary one is not
PNG, or JPEG if the primary one is PNG.)
<LI><B>Z</B> toggles auto section advance on and off.  When this is on, 
the section will change automatically after inserting a point if 
there was a section change between that point and the previous 
point.
<LI><B>b</B> builds a contour when AutoContour window is open.
<LI><B>a</B> advances to and fills next section when auto contouring.
<LI><B>u</B> smooths a filled area when auto contouring.
<LI><B>B</B> toggles the rubber band on and off.  The rubber band can be 
used to select an area, then snapshot the area, resize the window 
to that area, or find its coordinates.  After pressing B to turn on the 
rubber band, position the mouse at the desired upper left corner, click 
the first mouse button and hold it down while you move to the lower 
right corner.  After initially defining the band, you can adjust its 
size by placing the pointer near an edge or corner and 
dragging with the first mouse button.  The band can be moved as a 
unit by placing the pointer near an edge and dragging with the 
second mouse button.
<LI><B>I</B> prints information about the window and image size and 
the coordinates of the image in the window.  If the rubber band 
is on, the sizes and coordinates are relative to the rubber band 
rather than the window.  The image 
coordinates of the lower left and upper right corners, and of 
the center, are printed in the 3dmod info window.  There is also 
a fragment of a command line for extracting the image from the 
stack with <A HREF = "../man/trimvol.html">trimvol</A>; this is the same
command used by the Extract File entry in the File menu. 
This key also brings the Information 
Window to the front of the display.
<LI><B>R</B> resizes the window.  With the rubber band off, the window 
changes, 
if possible, to match the size of the entire image at the 
current zoom.  With the rubber band on, it changes to the size 
of the rubber band and the image is shifted to display the area 
previously in the rubber band.
<LI><B>Ctrl-A</B> adds multiple contours on the current section to the 
contour selection list.  Selected contours will be shown with a 
distinguishable line thickness.  
With the rubber band off, all eligible contours on the current section will be
added; with the rubber band on, only contours wih points appearing completely
within the rubber band will be selected.
Contours from the current object that are 
confined to the current section will be added; in addition, if the object is
open contour type and the contours pass between sections, then contours with
points on the current section that are all within the selection area will be
added.  Selected contours from other objects will be retained in the selection
if they meet the same criteria; all contours on other sections will be removed
from the selection.
<LI><B>Ctrl-Shift-A</B> adds multiple contours on the current
section to the contour selection list, taking contours from all objects rather
than just from the current object.
<LI><B>P</B> Toggles a mode in which you can shift, rotate, stretch, or scale
the whole current contour by dragging with a mouse button held down.  
The first mouse button is used to shift; the second button is used to rotate;
the third is used to stretch the contour along an axis, or to scale it
uniformly if the Shift key is held down.  If mouse buttons have their default
mappings, 
these functions are the same as in the
<A HREF = "../man/midas.html">Midas</A> program.
If multiple contours are selected, the same operation will be done on all of
them, including contours from objects other than the current object.
This mode stays active until toggled off again. 
To shift contour(s), position the mouse anywhere, press the first mouse 
button, and shift the contour(s) to the desired position.  
To rotate, press the second button and move the mouse in an arc around the 
center of mass of the selected contour(s); to stretch or scale, press the 
third button and move the mouse toward or away from this center point.
During these actions, the center of rotation/stretching will be marked with 
a star.
You can set this center by clicking with Ctrl and the second mouse button.
These operations work for any contours in closed contour objects and for
coplanar contours in open contour objects.
<LI><B>Arrow keys</B> and the <B>keypad</B>: In movie mode, the arrow keys and 
the <B>PageUp</B> and <B>PageDown</B> keys move the current viewing point (the 
small cross), while the keypad keys pan the image horizontally,
vertically, and diagonally.  In model mode, the arrow keys pan 
the image, the numeric keypad arrows move the current model point 
laterally, and the numeric keypad <B>PageUp</B> and <B>PageDown</B> keys move 
the current model point in Z.
<LI><B>Ins</B> on the keypad: In model mode, this key works the same as 
the second mouse button.  A single keystrike adds one point; 
holding the key down allows points to be added continuously.
<LI><B>ESC</B> will close the Zap window.

<LI><B>First Button Click</B>: Make the nearest visible model point be the 
current model point.  If there is no point nearby, this detaches from 
the current point and contour and selects a current viewing point 
instead.  To attach to points in any object, including ones that are turned
off, there is an option in the <B>Behavior</B> panel of the 3dmod Preferences 
dialog.
<LI><B>First Button Drag</B>: Pan the image if it is larger than the 
window, or adjust the size of the rubber band.
<LI><B>Ctrl - First Button Click</B>: Selects the nearest visible point 
as the current point but also adds this contour to a list of selected 
contours.  Selected contours in this list will be 
displayed with a distinguishable line thickness.  If a contour is 
already selected, Ctrl-clicking on it will deselect it.  The 
selection list is cleared by doing an ordinary first button selection 
of any model point, or by a variety of other operations, mostly ones 
that select a different contour from the current one.  Contours from more
than one object can be selected with this button.
<LI><B>Ctrl - First Button Drag</B>: Adds any contours that the mouse crosses 
to the list of selected contours.  Contours from more
than one object can be selected this way.

<LI><B>Second Button Click</B>: Add one point to the current contour.
<LI><B>Second Button Drag</B>: Continually add points to the current 
contour as the mouse is moved, or move the rubber band.
<LI><B>Third Button Click</B>: Modify the current model point to be at the 
selected position.
<LI><B>Third Button Drag</B>: Continually modify points as the mouse is 
moved.  This only works when the current model point is in the 
interior of the contour, not at its end.
<LI><B>Ctrl - Third Button Click</B>: Delete any points under the 
cursor in the current contour.
<LI><B>Ctrl - Third Button Drag</B>: Continually delete points under the
cursor as the mouse is moved.  At the end, the current point is 
set before the last deletion (or after, if modeling direction is 
inverted.)
