<P>
Break a single contour into two contours.  The break will occur at one or two
set points.  To set a point, first select the current point then select the
<B>Set 1</B> or <B>Set 2</B> button.  
<P>
If only one set point is set, then the
original contour will contain all the points before the set point, and a new
contour will contain the set point and all the points after the set point.  
This is usually what you want for breaking open contours but is
much less useful for breaking closed contours.
<P>
If both points are set, the second contour will contain points between and
including the two set points and the first contour will contain the remaining
points.  This is usually the best way to obtain the desired break with a closed
contour. 
<P>
Use <B>Unset</B> to undefine the second point and use only a single point for
breaking.
<P>
If <B>Use current point for 1</B> is selected, then the current model point
will automatically be used for set point 1.
<P>
The hot key <B>Ctrl+B</B> can be used in any window to break the contour, as
long as this dialog is open.
