<P>
Break a single contour into two contours.  The break will occur at one or two
set points.  To set a point, first select the current point then select the
<B>Set 1</B> or <B>Set 2</B> button.  If only one set point is set then the
original contour will contain all the points before the set point and a new
contour will contain the set point and all the points after the set point.  If
both points are set the second contour will contain points between and including
the two set points and the first contour will contain the remaining points.
