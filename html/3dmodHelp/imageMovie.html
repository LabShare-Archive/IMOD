</head>
<A NAME = "TOP"><H3>Image Movie Control</H3></A>
This window allows you to control the starting and ending 
coordinates within which a movie will run, the increment between 
successive frames, and the frame rate.  There are also controls for
automatically taking snapshots through the range of a movie, and for
taking a high-resolution (montaged) snapshot of the Zap or Slicer window.  The
options set in this dialog have an effect only while the window is open, so
you need to keep the window open to take movie snapshots.
<P>
Use the axis radio buttons to select whether the sliders will adjust 
the start, end, and increment for X, Y, Z or Time.  The initial 
default setting is for the sliders to adjust movies in Z.
<P>
The start and end values for Time have another function not related to movies:
they provide the limits for changing time with the "!" and "@" hot keys.  This
allows you to use these keys to toggle between two selected times, not just
the first and last time.
<P>
The <B>Reset</B> button will reset the start, end, and increment to 
their initial settings (the minimum and maximum coordinates and 
an increment of 1) for all four axes.
<P>
The <B>Done</B> button will close the window and reset these values in 
the same way.
<P>
The <B>Rate</B> text box will display the current frame rate as it is 
changed by the down and up Arrows or by "," and "." and will 
also allow you to enter a custom value.  You must type Enter to 
have your value take effect.
<P>
The next line shows two actual frame rates, the first averaged 
over the time since the current movie was started, the second 
an instantaneous rate since the last frame was displayed.  The 
actual rate will be less than the selected rate if the display is 
too slow to keep up, and can also differ from the selected rate 
due to lack of precision of the system clock.
<P>
If <B>Round Trip</B> is selected, then movies will loop from one 
end to the other then from that end back to the start; 
if <B>One Way</B> is selected, then movies will always go in one 
direction and jump back to the start when the end is reached.
<P>
If one of the <B>Snapshot</B> buttons, <B>TIFF</B> or one of the two non-TIFF
buttons, is selected, 
and a movie is started in a Zap or Slicer window, then that window 
will automatically take a snapshot of each frame in the given format for 
one complete cycle of the movie.  The default non-TIFF formats should be JPEG
and PNG.  To change the format of the first non-TIFF option,
use the menu entry <B>Edit-Options</B> and
go to the <B>Behavior</B> panel.  The second option will be PNG if the first
one is not PNG, or JPEG if the first one is PNG.
<UL>
<LI>If <B>Start/end</B> is selected, the 
movie will start at the 
starting or the ending section depending on whether it is started 
with the middle or the right mouse button.  It will stop when it 
reaches the opposite end if <B>One Way</B> is selected; otherwise it 
will loop back to the end at which it started.
<LI>If <B>Current pt</B> is 
selected, the movie will start at the currently displayed section and 
top
come back to that point in a full round trip; in this case <B>One way</B> 
will not give useful results.
</UL>
<P>
If you stop the movie before it is done, 
then another mouse click in that or a different window will 
start a completely new movie.
<P>
<H4>Montage Snapshots</H4>
This capability can be used to get a snapshot of a display larger
than what will fit in the Zap or Slicer window.
<P>
If <B>Montage</B> is selected for one of the two window types and this dialog
is open, then a snapshot of the window (via any
of the Ctrl and/or Shift S hot keys) will be taken as a montage of frames at a
higher zoom.
High-resolution display is automatically used for these frames.
The montage is assembled in memory and
saved as a single TIFF or non-TIFF image, depending on which hot key was used
for the snapshot.  In addition, if you start a movie in the
Zap or Slicer window when one of the  <B>Snapshot</B> buttons is on, a montage
will be taken at each section in the movie range and saved as a TIFF or
non-TIFF image, depending on which snapshot type is selected. 
<P>
In the Snapshot tab of the 3dmod Preferences dialog, you can set a resolution
in dots per inch (DPI) to be stored in a TIFF or JPEG snapshot file.  That tab
also has an option to have your specified resolution scaled up by the
zoom factor of the montage.  With that option selected, montages based on
different numbers of frames will all appear at the same size as an ordinary
snapshot in viewers that pay attention to the DPI setting (e.g., Adobe
products).
<P>
Another useful option is available in the File menu: <B>Gray TIF Snaps</B>.
With this selected, all TIFF snapshots will be converted to 8-bit gray-scale.
This setting is not stored between instances of the program.
<P>
On some machines you may need to make sure that there are no other windows on
top of the Zap or Slicer window.  The settings in this section are
saved across sessions of 3dmod, including whether to take montage snapshots
when the dialog is open.
<P>
<H4>Zap Montage Snapshots</H4>
The <B>Montage</B> button in this section of the dialog controls whether a
montage snapshot is taken of a Zap window.
If <B>Whole image at 1:1 zoom</B> is <I>not</I> selected, then the
<B>by</B> spin box is used to select the amount that
the image is zoomed up from its current zoom for the snapshot.
Just the area of the image showing in the Zap
window will be captured; i.e., borders are eliminated.
<P>Select <B>Whole image at 1:1 zoom</B> to get a snapshot of the entire image
at a zoom of 1.  The program selects a montaging factor that will work for
capturing the whole image at zoom 1.  This feature is useful, for example, for
getting a full-resolution JPEG snapshot of an image that is too large to fit
on the screen.
<P>
If <B>Scale sizes by</B> is selected during a montage snapshot, 
then the thicknesses of all model
lines and the sizes of all symbols will be scaled up by the amount selected in
the spin box.  
These thicker, larger lines will then show up well if the image is scaled
back down to the original size, such as when it is embedded in a figure.
You can select either a specific scaling or <B>Auto</B> scaling
by selecting the value below 2 in the spin box.  With auto-scaling, the sizes
will be scaled by the product of the zoom before montaging and the montaging
factor for zooms below 1, otherwise by the montaging factor.  This will
produce no scaling when taking a whole image at 1:1 zoom, and scaling by the
montaging factor in most other cases.
<P>
To get a Zap montage snapshot,
the rubberband must be off, otherwise an
ordinary snapshot of the enclosed subarea will be taken.  
<P>
<H4>Slicer Montage Snapshots</H4>
The <B>Montage</B> button in the bottom section of the dialog controls whether
a montage snapshot is taken of a Slicer window.
The <B>by</B> spin box is used to select the amount that
the image is zoomed up from its current zoom for the snapshot.
The whole area of the slicer 
window will be captured, including any borders.
<P>
If <B>Scale thickness by</B> is selected during a montage snapshot, 
then the thicknesses of all model
lines will be scaled up by the amount selected in
the spin box.  (The methods used to draw the model in a Slicer automatically
scale Symbols and spheres by the absolute zoom factor.)
These thicker, larger lines will then show up well if the image is scaled
back down to the original size, such as when it is embedded in a figure.
You can select either a specific scaling or <B>Auto</B> scaling
by selecting the value below 2 in the spin box.  With auto-scaling, the sizes
will be scaled by the product of the zoom before montaging and the montaging
factor for zooms below 1, otherwise by the montaging factor.  This will
produce a scaling that is appropriate when the output image is scaled back to
the size that original image would have at 1:1 zoom.
