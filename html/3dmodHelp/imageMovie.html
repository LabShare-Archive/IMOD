<H3>Image Movie Control</H3>
This window allows you to control the starting and ending 
coordinates within which a movie will run, the increment between 
successive frames, and the frame rate.
<P>
Use the axis radio buttons to select whether the sliders will adjust 
the start, end, and increment for X, Y, Z or Time.  The initial 
default setting is for the sliders to adjust movies in Z.
<P>
The <B>Reset</B> button will reset the start, end, and increment to 
their initial settings (the minimum and maximum coordinates and 
an increment of 1) for all four axes.
<P>
The <B>Done</B> button will close the window and reset these values in 
the same way.
<P>
The <B>Rate</B> text box will display the current frame rate as it is 
changed by the down and up Arrows or by "," and "." and will 
also allow you to enter a custom value.  You must type Enter to 
have your value take effect.
<P>
The next line shows two actual frame rates, the first averaged 
over the time since the current movie was started, the second 
an instantaneous rate since the last frame was displayed.  The 
actual rate will be less than the selected rate if the display is 
too slow to keep up, and can also differ from the selected rate 
due to lack of precision of the system clock.
<P>
If <B>Round Trip</B> is selected, then movies will loop from one 
end to the other then from that end back to the start; 
if <B>One Way</B> is selected, then movies will always go in one 
direction and jump back to the start when the end is reached.
<P>
If one of the <B>Snapshot</B> buttons, <B>TIFF</B> or the non-Tiff button
(initially <B>RGB</B>), is selected, 
and a movie is started in a Zap or Slicer window, then that window 
will automatically take a snapshot of each frame in the given format for 
one complete cycle of the movie.  To change the format of the non-Tiff option,
use the menu entry <B>Edit-Options</B> and
go to the <B>Behavior</B> panel.
<UL>
<LI>If <B>Start/end</B> is selected, the 
movie will start at the 
starting or the ending section depending on whether it is started 
with the middle or the right mouse button.  It will stop when it 
reaches the opposite end if <B>One Way</B> is selected; otherwise it 
will loop back to the end at which it started.
<LI>If <B>Current pt</B> is 
selected, the movie will start at the currently displayed section and 
come back to that point in a full round trip; in this case <B>One way</B> 
will not give useful results.
</UL>
<P>
If you stop the movie before it is done, 
then another mouse click in that or a different window will 
start a completely new movie.
