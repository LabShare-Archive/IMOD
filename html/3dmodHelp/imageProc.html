<H3>Image Processing</H3>
Various kinds of simple filters can be applied with these 
controls.  The filter will always be applied to the current 
section.  Note that many of these filters can be applied to a whole image
stack through the
<A HREF = "../man/clip.html">Clip</A> program.
<P>
Single-click in the list of filters to select the current filter 
to be applied to the data; in some cases there will be further 
parameters to select.
<P>
Pressing the <B>Apply</B> button or the <B>a</B> hot key will apply the
current filter to the ORIGINAL image data.  Double-clicking in the filter list
is the same as pressing the <B>Apply</B> button.  
<P>
Pressing the <B>More</B> button or the <B>b</B> hot key will apply the filter
to the CURRENT image data, as modified by previous filter operations.
<P>
Pressing the <B>Reset</B> button, applying a filter to a different 
section, closing the window with <B>Done</B>, or flipping the data 
volume will all restore the original image data for a section, 
unless you press the <B>Save</B> button.  <B>Save</B> will permanently 
replace the image data in memory with the processed data.
<P>
<H4>Fourier Filtering</H4>
The Fourier filter is done by taking Fourier transforms and its 
parameters are the <B>radius</B> and <B>sigma</B> parameters used in 
several other IMOD programs.  Namely, the <B>Low frequency sigma</B> is 
the sigma of an inverted Gaussian starting at the origin, used to 
attenuate low frequencies.  Low pass filtering is done with a 
Gaussian starting at the <B>High-frequency cutoff</B> and  
with a sigma given by the <B>High-frequency falloff</B>.  The units are 
cycles per pixel, ranging from 0 to 0.5.  The same filtering can be done
at the command line with "mtffilter -high sigma -low cutoff,falloff", where
"sigma", "cutoff", and "falloff" are the values used in this panel.
<P>
<H4>Fourier Transforms</H4>
To take a Fourier transform (FFT), the program will pad the image 
into a square array slightly larger than the original image, taper 
the image at its edges to minimize edge artifacts, take the FFT, 
apply log scaling, and clip out the portion that fits into the 
original image size.  For a non-square image, the FFT will thus be 
isotropic (X and Y scales the same) but truncated in one dimension.  
The panel will show the range of frequencies that appear in the X 
and Y dimensions.  Binning can be used to see the whole transform for 
a non-square image, and also to reduce noise and execution time.  
With binning, the smaller FFT will be embedded into a black 
background.
<P>
To do an FFT of a subregion, turn on <B>Use Zap window subarea</B>.  If 
the rubber band is on in the active Zap window, the FFT will be taken 
of the area inside the rubber band.  Otherwise, the area used will be 
the portion of the image showing in the window.
<P>
The <B>Compute frequency</B> button can be used to 
determine the frequency at a particular location in the FFT.  First, click on
that location with the first mouse button, or deposit a model point there,
then press the button.  If you are in model mode and there is a current
model point, its position will be used; otherwise the current image
position is used.  The current image position is rounded to the nearest pixel
while a model point can provide subpixel accuracy if needed.
The program will compute the frequency in reciprocal
pixels then divide by the pixel size in the model header to get the frequency
that is show (e.g., reciprocal nanometers).  The inverse of this value is also
shown to provide a resolution value in real space units.
<P>
The panel also shows the scale that is used to convert from pixels 
in the FFT to frequency units.  
<H4>Median Filtering</H4>
Median filtering replaces each pixel by the median value of neighboring
pixels, where the <B>Size</B> parameter determines the size of the block of
pixels.  The default is to do the filtering in 3D, and take the median in a
cube of voxels.  Filtering in 2D, considering only the pixels on the current
section, can be done if you turn off <B>Compute median in 3D cube</B>.  With
2D filtering, you can iterate by pressing <B>More</B>.  However, with 3D
filtering, pressing <B>More</B> will not have much effect and will not be the
same as iterative filtering in 3D, because only the central slice has been
filtered.
<P>
<H4>Anisotropic Diffusion</H4>
This panel provides parameters for running a simple anisotropic diffusion
algorithm using the Perona and Malik filtering
method, based on a program by Alejandro Canterero.  The gradients in this
method are simply pixel-to-pixel differences.  The ratio between these
pixel-to-pixel differences and the threshold <B>K</B> determines how much
diffusion is allowed between pixels.
<P>
The <B>Edge Stopping Function</B> radio buttons allow you to choose
between the <B>Rational edge</B> stopping function and the <B>Tukey
biweight</B> stopping function, which correspond to options <B>-cc 2</B> and
<B>-cc 3</B>, respectively, in <A HREF = "../man/clip.html">Clip</A>.
The Tukey biweight will preserve more
local structure than the rational edge stopping function.
<P>
The <B>Iterations</B> value controls how many iterations are run when
<B>Apply</B> or <B>More</B> is pressed.  The total number of iterations done
is also reported.  The routine will give the identical result if a certain
number of iterations are done with multiple steps
using <B>More</B> rather than all at once.
<P>
The <B>K</B> entry sets a threshold for the edge stopping function; when the
number is too low virtually nothing will happen.  The rational edge function
may require smaller values than the Tukey biweight.  The <B>unscaled</B>
value is the number that should be specified with the <B>-k</B> option
in <A HREF = "../man/clip.html">Clip</A> to achieve the same filtering on the
raw data from the image file as is seen on the scaled byte data in 3dmod.
<P>
The <B>Lambda</B> value controls the so-called time-step; if images become
noisier this probably needs to be reduced.
