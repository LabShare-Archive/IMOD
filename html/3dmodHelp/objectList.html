<H2>Object List Dialog</H2>
The Object List dialog conatins a complete set of checkboxes for turning
objects on and off.  The object names and colors are also shown.  In addition,
there is a set of controls for defining groups of objects and turning objects
in a group on or off.  There can be multiple groups of objects, and an object
can belong to more than one group.
<P>
The top row of the <B>Object Group Selection</B> section contains a spin box
for selecting the current group, an indicator of the number of groups defined
(initially <B>/0</B> when there are no groups), and an edit box for entering a
name for the group.  The second row has buttons for operating on the groups
themselves, and the third row has buttons for operating on objects.
<P>
Initially, the spin box will show
<B>None</B> and all buttons will be disabled except <B>New</B>.  When you
create a new group with <B>New</B> or select an existing group, the rest of
the buttons will become available.  In addition, a second checkbox will appear
for each object, to the left of the On/Off checkbox, to indicate whether the
object is a member of the group.
<UL>
<LI>Use the <B>New</B> button to add a new object group.  If there is a
current group defined, the new group will initially be a copy of that group.
<LI>The <B>Delete</B> button will remove the current group from the list of
groups.
<LI>The <B>Clear</B> button will remove all objects from the current group.
<LI>The <B>Add All</B> button will add all objects to the current group.
<LI>The <B>Swap</B> button will exchange group members and non-members;
current members will be dropped from the group and the rest of the objects
will be added to it.
<LI>The <B>ON</B> button will turn on all members of the current group
without affecting any other objects.
<LI>The <B>OFF</B> button will turn off all members of the current group
without affecting any other objects.
<LI>The <B>Others Off</B> button will turn off all objects except members of
the current group.  Thus, to see just the objects in a group, push <B>ON</B>
and <B>Others Off</B>.
</UL>
In addition to these buttons for turning groups On and Off, a number of
properties can be changed in tandem for members of a group by selecting
<B>Group</B> in the <B>Edit</B> combo box of the
<A HREF="modvObjectEdit.html">Object Edit dialog</A>.
<P>
The object groups defined here will be saved as part of the model, but the
number of the current group is not saved between sessions of 3dmod.  When the
program is started as 3dmod rather than 3dmodv, changes in groups can be
undone just like other model changes.
