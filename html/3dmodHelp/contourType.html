<H2>Surface/Contour/Point Dialog</H2>
This dialog has a collection of controls for more advanced modeling features:
defining and manipulating surface numbers for contours; adjusting some
properties of contours; giving sizes to individual points; and assigning names
to surfaces, contours or points.  There are also controls for the display of
ghost contours from adjacent sections.
<P>
<H3>Surface controls</H3>
<P>
Each contour has its own surface number.  The surface number can be used for
subgrouping contours without having to create new objects.  The surface number
of the current contour is displayed in the <B>Surface</B> spin box.  To the
right of the spin box is the maximum surface number in the current object
("/ #").  You can go to the first contour in the next or previous surface by
clicking the up or down arrows of the spin box.  Non-existent surfaces are
skipped when you move between surfaces.  You can also go to the first contour of
any surface by entering a number in the box and pressing Enter; the program will
select the nearest available surface.
<P>
The <B>Contour in surf</B> Up and Down arrows can be used to step to the next
and previous contours within the current surface.
<P>
The <B>New</B> button will start a new surface with the next free number and
create an empty contour with that surface number.
<P>
The <B>Ghost</B> check box may be used during model editing to highlight the
current contour, along with all other contours with the same surface number.
<P>
It is possible to have a label for each surface.  The <B>Label</B> text box
shows the label of the current surface; simply enter or change text in this box.
<P>
<H3>Contour controls</H3>
<P>
The <B>Closed</B> and <B>Open</B> radio buttons select between closed and open
contours in an object defined as having closed contours.  The default is a
closed contour where the last point is connected to the first.  An open contour
will not be connected between the last and first points, thus allowing a
partially cut surface to be represented by an object containing both closed and
open contours.  This setting has no effect for an object defined as having open
or scattered point contours, so the buttons are disabled in that case.
<P>
The time index of contours in 4-dimensional datasets can be changed with the
<B>Time Index</B> spin box.  The box shows the time index of the current
contour, which can be incremented or decremented with the spin box arrows, or
changed by typing in a new number followed by <B>Enter</B>.  Contours with a
non-zero time index display at only the relevant time; contours with a zero
index display at all times.  This box is active only when the <B>Contours have
time values</B> check box is selected for the particular object in the
<B>Edit</B>-<B>Object</B>-<B>Type</B> dialog.
<P>
It is possible to have a label for each contour.  The <B>Label</B> text box
shows the label of the current contour; simply enter or change text in this box.
<P>
<H3>Point controls</H3>
<P>
It is possible to assign a size for each point.  Any point with an individual
size will be displayed as a 3D sphere of this radius, even if the object type
is not scattered points.  The units are pixels in the image file, i.e.,
unbinned
pixels if images are loaded in binned.  Points without a size will still be
displayed at the size specified for the object as a whole.  You can change a
size either by typing a number into the text box (followed by <B>Enter</B>) or
by using the slider.  If a point has no size, the text box displays the global
point size for the object and "-Default".
<P>
If <B>Set with mouse wheel</B> is checked, then you can adjust the size of the
current point with the scroll wheel when the mouse is in a Zap window. 
This feature will work for
points that already have some size.  If a point does not have an individual
size and the default size for the object is 0, then the wheel control is
disabled. (This is to prevent inadvertent size changes while drawing ordinary
planar contours.)  To use the wheel control in this case, click the slider
in this dialog to get some size, then go back to the Zap window and adjust
with the wheel.
The change in size for one click of the wheel varies with zoom for zooms
between 1 and 4; to get the smallest increment, zoom up to 4 or higher.
<P>
Each individual point can also have its own label.  The <B>Label</B> text box
shows the label of the current point; simply enter or change text in this box.
<P>
<H3>Section ghost controls</H3>
<P>
These items may be used to control the section-to-section ghost display mode.
Use the spin box to set the maximum number of sections that contours will be
displayed as ghosts on.  For example, with a value of 3, contours will be
displayed as ghosts from up to 3 sections away.  If the <B>Up</B> box is
checked, then contours will be displayed as ghosts on following sections; the
<B>Down</B> check box will display contours as ghosts on previous sections.  The
<B>g</B> hot key will toggle the combination selected by these boxes on and off.
<P>
If <B>Lighter</B> box is checked, the ghost contours will be displayed in a
lighter color, otherwise they will be drawn with a darker color.  If the
<B>All objects</B> box is checked, ghosts will be drawn for all objects instead
of just for the current object.
