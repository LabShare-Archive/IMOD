<H2>Bead Fixer Special Module</H2>
<P>
This module makes it easier to fix tilt series fiducial 
models in two ways.  It has a function for finding the next 
gap or untracked place in the model and making that be the 
current point.  It also will read the log file from running 
Tiltalign and move to points with high residuals.

<H3>Controls</H3>
Toggle the <B>pin</B> button on to keep the bead fixer window on top of 
other windows
<P>
Press the <B>Go to Next Gap</B> button or hit the space bar key to 
move to the next gap or incomplete place in the model.  If 
there is a gap, the point BEFORE the gap will be displayed.  
If a contour does not start on the first section, the first 
point in the contour (which is AFTER the gap) will be 
displayed and a message will be printed.  The program 
searches forward from the current point except the first time 
when the function is selected.  To begin the search at the 
beginning of the model again, detach from the current point 
by clicking the left mouse button far from any model point, 
then select the Next Gap function.
<P>
Press the <B>Open Tiltalign Log File</B> button to open a log 
file.
<P>
Press the <B>Go to Next Big Residual</B> button or hit the 
apostrophe key to move to the next point in the log file 
with a big residual.
<P>
The X and Y displacements implied by the residual are printed 
in the Info window.  Also, the Zap window will draw an arrow 
corresponding to these displacements.  If the arrow ends at the place 
where the point should be located (i.e., the center of the bead), 
then press the <B>Move Point by Residual</B> button or push the semicolon key 
to move the point by those amounts in X and Y.
<P>
After moving a point by its residual, press the <B>Undo Move</B> 
button or push the U key to undo the move.
<P>
Press the <B>Reread Log File</B> button to reread the file, or a 
new version of it after rerunning Tiltalign.
<P>
Press the <B>Save & Run Tiltalign</B> button to save the model, rerun 
Tiltalign, and read in the new log file.  Most buttons will be disabled 
while Tiltalign is running and reenabled when it is done, so you will 
be able to tell that something is happening.  If you change the 
alignment parameters in eTomo, be sure to compute the next alignment 
using the button in eTomo rather than this button.
<P>
Press the <B>Go to Next Local Set</B> button if you have a log file 
with a series of local alignments and want to skip to the 
residuals from the next local alignment.
<P>
When local alignments were used, the <B>Move All in Local Area</B> button can
be used to move all remaining points with big residuals in the current local 
area.  Points that would ordinarily be skipped over because they have been
examined already will not be moved.  This is a somewhat controversial approach
to alignment that should be
used with caution.  One suggested practice is to examine the first few points
in a local area by hand to see that the suggested movements are appropriate,
then press this button to move the rest.
<P>
Select the <B>Back Up to Last Point</B> button if you want to go back to 
the last residual that you examined.  This will not necessarily be the 
previous residual in the file, if you skipped over points by going to 
the next local set, or if the program skipped over points that you saw 
before.  However, you can then work forward through the 
points that you skipped over.
<P>
The program keeps a list of each point whose residual has 
been examined.  The list is retained when the log file is read again.  
If the <B>Examine Points Once</B> checkbox is 
selected, then any point already on the list is skipped over 
when you <B>Go to Next Big Residual</B>.  A point is added to the 
list regardless of whether <B>Examine Points Once</B> is selected.  
If you turn this checkbox off, you will see every point when going 
forward or backward.
<P>
Press the <B>Clear Examined List</B> button to empty the list of 
points that have been examined.  The list is not cleared when 
<B>Examine Points Once</B> is switched on or off.  To see some 
points for the second time, turn off <B>Examine Points Once</B>; to 
see all points again, push <B>Clear Examined List</B>.  When you <B>Back Up
 to Last Point</B>, the current point is removed from the list so that 
you will come back to it when you go forward again.
