<H3>3dmod Startup Window</H3>
When 3dmod is started with no arguments or with the -O argument, this dialog
is opened to provide the ability to select many of the options that can be
controlled with command-line arguments.  In addition, input files can
be selected with a file chooser.
<P>
The <B>Start program as</B> radio buttons select the mode in which the
program will be run; the two choices are equivalent to starting the
program
at the command line with "3dmod" or "3dmodv".
<P>
The three lines for specifying input files allow you either to type
file names into the text boxes or to open a file chooser to select the
files, using a <B>Select</B> button.  The first line is used to
specify either image files, when running the program as "3dmod", or
model
files, when running as "3dmodv".  There are several special features
for this line:
<UL>
<LI> Multiple files can be selected.
<LI> Multiple file names can always be separated by semicolons, and
they can usually separated by spaces.  When the names are returned
from the file chooser, they will be separated by spaces if they do not
contain any spaces themselves.  When you type names into the edit box,
you can separate them by spaces if they are just filenames with no
directory paths.  If you enter any directory paths with the names, you
must separate multiple names with semicolons.
<LI> The wild card characters * and ? can be used for file name
entries; * matches any set of characters and ? matches a single character.
</UL>
<P>
The rest of the items in the window correspond to options documented
in the <A HREF = "../man/3dmod.html">3dmod</A> or

and activates the <B>-Z</B>, <B>-xyz</B>, <B>-S</B>, and <B>-V</B>
