<H3>Slicer Angle Storage</H3>
This window allows you to store slicer angles and positions in a model and
return to those positions in a slicer window.  It has a table that shows all
of the stored angles and positions.  You can edit the values in the
table as well as enter a label for each one.  The angles can be
obtained from the slicer only when you press a button, or a continuous
update mode can be selected so that angles are recorded as they
change.  All stored angles are assigned a time value corresponding to
the image file being displayed.  When more than one image file is
loaded into 3dmod, the table shows angles only for the current time.
Each time has an independent value for the current row, so the
current row may switch when you change times.
<P>
If there is more than one slicer window, the angle window always exchanges
data with the last active slicer.  A slicer window becomes the active
window when you use a hot key, slider, or other control in that
window.
<P>
<B>Row operations</B>. These buttons operate on one row of values in
the table.  A row can be made the current row by clicking in one of
its cells, or by clicking the numbered button on the left.  When you
click one of those buttons, the slicer will be set to the angles in
that row.
<UL>
<LI><B>Get Angles</B> will fetch the angles and position from the
slicer into the current table row.
<LI><B>Set Angles</B> will set the slicer to the angles and position
in the current table row.
<LI><B>Delete</B> will delete the current row of values.
<LI><B>New Row</B> creates a new row in the table and stores the
current slicer angles there.
</UL>
<P>
<B>Operations on volume angles sets</B>.  These controls appear when
you have loaded more than one image file into 3dmod, or when the model
file already has angles stored for more than one time value from a
previous run with multiple image files.  They operate on the entire
set of angles shown in the table at once.
<UL>
<LI><B>Remove</B> deletes the angles shown in the table for the
current time, and shifts the times of all angles at higher times down
by one.
<LI><B>Insert</B> effectively inserts an empty angle list for the
current time by shifting the times of all angles at the current time and
higher times up by one.
<LI><B>Renumber To</B> moves the set of all angles at the current time
to a different time, as selected in the spin box.  Angles at times
between the current time and the target time are shifted up or down by
one, so the angle sets are just rearranged without losing any.
<LI><B>Copy From</B> replaces all the entries at the current time with
a copy of the angles from a different time, as selected in the spin box.
</UL>
<P>
<B>Continuous update</B>.  When this option is off, angles are fetched
from a slicer only when <B>Get Angles</B> is pressed.  The slicer is
set to an angle when either <B>Set Angles</B> or one of the numbered
buttons on the left are pressed.  When the option is on, angle or
position changes in a slicer automatically modify the stored
values that are shown in the current row.  When the time is changed,
the slicer is automatically set to the current values for the new
time ( which can be in a different row of the table).  In addition, if
you edit one of the cells, the values in that row are sent to the
slicer.
<P>
<B>Odds and Ends</B>.  
<UL>
<LI> Undo and redo are available for all changes in
stored angles.  
<LI> The buttons on the left may not work 100% of the time
as a substitute for <B>Set Angles</B>
especially right after changing times.
<LI> To edit a cell, just click once and start typing to replace the
current contents completely, or double click to edit the contents.
Press "Esc" to abandon editing after clicking a cell.
Press "Enter" when you are done editing a cell.
<LI> Labels can be up to 32 characters long.  Cell columns can be
resized with the mouse, which you might need to do to show a long label.
</UL>
