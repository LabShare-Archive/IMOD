<A NAME = "TOP"><H2>Slicer Angle Storage</H2></A>
This window allows you to store slicer angles and positions in a model and
return to those positions in a slicer window.  It has a table that shows all
of the stored angles and positions.  You can edit the values in the
table as well as enter a label for each one.  When you open this window,
a toolbar will appear in each slicer window with buttons that allow you to
save angles from that slicer into the table or set the angles from the table.
The angles can be
saved only when you press a button, or an automatic (continuous)
update mode can be selected so that angles are recorded as they
change.  All stored angles are assigned a time value corresponding to
the image file being displayed.  When more than one image file is
loaded into 3dmod, the table shows angles only for the current time.
Each time has an independent value for the current row, so the
current row may switch when you change times.
<P>
There is also a button in this window to set the angles in a slicer window.
If there is more than one slicer window, the angles are set in
the last active slicer.  A slicer window becomes the active
window when you use a hot key, slider, or other control in that
window, not when the slicer acquires the focus for keyboard input.  
<P>
Angles are usually saved to or set from the current row of the table.
A row can be made the current row by clicking in one of
its cells, or by clicking the numbered button on the left.
<P>
All of the information in the table is saved as part of the model file and
becomes available when a model is read in to a new instance of 3dmod.
Undo and redo are available for all changes in
stored values.
<P>
<B>Slicer toolbar buttons</B>. The labels on these buttons are brief, but they
have descriptive tooltips.
<UL>
<LI><B>Save</B> saves the angles and position in the current row of the table,
or into a new row if there are no rows in a table.  
<LI><B>New</B> saves the angles and position into a new row in the table.
<LI><B>Set</B> sets the angles and position from the current row of the table.
<LI><B>Auto</B> selects an automatic (continuous) update of the current row of
the table from changes in this slicer.  When this option is off, angles are
saved only when <B>Save</B> is pressed.  The slicer is set to an angle only
when either the <B>Set</B> toolbar button or the <B>Set Angles</B> button in
this window is pressed.  When the option is on, angle or position changes in a
slicer automatically modify the stored values that are shown in the current
row.  Changing the current row of the table will set the angles in the active
slicer.  When the time is changed, the slicer is automatically set to the 
current
values for the new time (which can be in a different row of the table).  In
addition, if you edit one of the cells, the values in that row are sent to the
slicer.
When this option is turned on, neither the slicer position nor the
angles in the table are changed because it is not known which action you
desire - it is up to you to sychronize the angles in the table with the slicer
window one way or the other.

<P>

<B>Buttons above the table</B>. These buttons operate on one row of values in
the table.
<UL>
<LI><B>Set Angles</B> will set the active slicer to the angles and position
in the current table row.
<LI><B>Delete</B> will delete the current row of values.
</UL>
<P>
<B>Working with the table</B>.  
<UL>
<LI> To edit a cell, just click once and start typing to replace the
current contents completely, or double click to edit the contents.
Press "Esc" to abandon editing after clicking a cell.
Press "Enter" when you are done editing a cell.
<LI> Once you have clicked in a cell, you can use up and down arrow keys to
move between rows.  If automatic update is on in the active slicer, then
this provides an easy way to toggle between two angles.
<LI> After clicking in a cell, the table has the focus for keyboard input and
hot keys will not be passed on to other windows.  Press "Tab" to take the
focus away from the table.
<LI> Labels can be up to 32 characters long.  Cell columns can be
resized with the mouse, which you might need to do to show a long label.  The
whole dialog box can also be resized to make the table bigger.
</UL>
<P>
<B>Operations on volume angle sets</B>.  These controls appear when
you have loaded more than one image file into 3dmod, or when the model
file already has angles stored for more than one time value from a
previous run with multiple image files.  They operate on the entire
set of angles shown in the table at once and they allow you to change the set
of angles associated with each volume.
<UL>
<LI><B>Remove</B> deletes the angles shown in the table for the
current time, and shifts the times of all angles at higher times down
by one.
<LI><B>Insert</B> effectively inserts an empty angle list for the
current time by shifting the times of all angles at the current time and
higher times up by one.
<LI><B>Renumber To</B> moves the set of all angles at the current time
to a different time, as selected in the spin box.  Angles at times
between the current time and the target time are shifted up or down by
one, so the angle sets are just rearranged without losing any.
<LI><B>Copy From</B> replaces all the entries at the current time with
a copy of the angles from a different time, as selected in the spin box.
