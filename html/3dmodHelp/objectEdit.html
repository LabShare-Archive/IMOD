<H3>Editing Object Properties</H3>
The Object Type dialog edits the current object. 
One can leave this dialog open and change the current 
object.
<P>
<B>Object Name:</B> Enter a name for the object.
<P>
<B>Draw:</B> Turns drawing on/off in image windows.
<P>
<B>Open/Closed/Scattered radio buttons:</B> 
Set how points in object are connected.  Open and closed 
contour objects are drawn with lines between the points; 
closed contours have a line connecting the last point back 
to the first one; scattered point objects have no 
connecting lines.
<P>
<B>Front Face:</B> Outside/Inside toggles select which side of the contours 
will be brightly lit after the object is meshed.  This 
feature can also be used to select an area of interest as 
inside or outside the contours, for some programs.
<P>
<B>Symbols:</B> Chooses how symbols are drawn.  Open or filled symbols of 
three shapes may be drawn at each model point.  Symbol size 
is governed by the Size slider.  Independent of whether 
symbols are drawn at each point, if Mark Ends is selected, 
green and red crosses are drawn over the first and last 
points of a contour.
<P>
<B>Sphere radius for points:</B> If this sphere size is nonzero, then spheres
will be drawn in 3-D at every point of the object.  These spheres appear in
the model view window and appear in cross-section on 
one or more slices of the image display.  The units are pixels in the 
image file, i.e., unbinned pixels if images are loaded in binned.
<P>
<B>Show spheres on-section only:</B> By default, spherical points are drawn 
in the Zap and XYZ windows on all sections that the spheres intersect.  Turn
this button on to inhibit this behavior and have them drawn only on the
central section where the point is located.  This could be useful if you want
to have a circle around the point that is a fixed size in image pixels
regardless of zoom, but do not want the point to show up off-section.
<P>
<B>Line Width:</B> Sets the width for lines drawn on images, but not for 
lines in 3D.
<P>
<B>Time data:</B> If multiple image files are loaded, this toggle button 
controls whether time information is encoded 
in contours as they are drawn.  If the button is on, then 
each new contour that is created will be assigned to the 
currently displayed time, and it will appear only over 
images at that time.  In addition, the Time Index text box 
in the Contour/Surface/Point window can be used to adjust the 
time value of a contour.  If the button is off, then new 
contours will not be assigned to the current time but 
rather will have a time value of 0 and will appear over 
images at all times.
