<A NAME = "TOP"><H3>Model Movie Sequence Dialog</H3></A>
<H4>Movie Segments and Sequences</H4>
This dialog allows you to save a series of movie parameters that have been set
up in the <A HREF="modelMovie.html">Model Movie</A> dialog, then run all of the
movies in sequence.  The series of images produced by pressing
the <B>Make</B> button in the Movie dialog is referred 
to as a movie segment, and a series of such movie segments is referred to as a
movie sequence.  Each time that a segment is saved in the Sequence dialog, the
parameters governing that segment are stored internally, and the segment is
represented by a new row in the table.
<P>
Several pieces of information are stored for each segment
in addition to all of the values shown in the Movie dialog. They are:
<UL>
<LI> <B>View number.</B> Different model views can be created with
  the <A HREF="modvViewEdit.html">View Editing</A> dialog.  The current view
  number is stored for each segment, and that view is switched to when playing
  that segment.  Having different views for different segments provides the
  most powerful control over the display, and is necessary if you want to
  change object color, transparency, clipping planes, or most other object
  properties.  However, it is not necessary if you just want to turn some
  objects on or off, or change global clipping planes.
<LI> <B>Object On/Off states.</B> The current On/Off state of each object is
  saved when a segment is saved.  When the segment is run, objects will be
  turned on or off as appropriate.  This occurs after the change in view (if
  any) and thus overrides the On/Off states stored in the view.
<IL> <B>Object transparencies.</B> Transparencies are saved for each object
  that changed transparency during the segment.  When the segment is run,
  these objects will change transparency linearly between the two limits.  The
  starting transparencies are set after the change in view (if
  any) and thus override the object properties in the view.
<LI> <B>Global clipping planes</B> The rotation angles and on/off states of all
  global clipping planes are recorded when a segment is saved, as well as the
  positions of the plane at the start and end of the segment.  Again, these
  parameters are imposed after the change in view, if any.
<LI> <B>Image display settings</B>  If image display is turned on, all of the
  parameters in the <A HREF="modvImage.html">Image View</A> dialog are
  recorded, including which image planes to display, the size in each
  dimension, the black and white levels, and whether to use false color.
</UL>
<H4>Controls in the Movie Sequence Dialog</H4>
The controls are organized in 3 sections.  The top row of buttons modify the
segments stored in the table by taking information from the Movie dialog or by
deleting a segment.  The second row of buttons operate in the reverse
direction, applying settings in the currenly selected segment either to the
Movie dialog or directly to the display.  The bottom row of buttons operates
on all segments, running them, saving them to file, or loading from a file.
<UL>
<LI> <B>Add After.</B> This button adds a segment based on the current
  parameters in the Movie dialog and other display settings.  It is added
  after the segment selected in the table, or simply added if the table is
  empty.
<LI> <B>Add Before.</B> This button adds a segment before instead of after
  the segment selected in the table.
<LI> <B>Replace.</B> This button modifies the segment selected in the table 
  based on the current parameters in the Movie dialog and other display
  settings.
<LI> <B>Delete.</B> This button removes the segment selected in the table.
<LI> <B>Use as Movie.</B> Press this button to restore the settings needed to
  play the selected segment as a movie again from the Movie dialog.  The Start
  and End fields in the Movie dialog will be filled in with these settings,
  but these settings will not be applied to the display.
  However, the view number, On/Off states, and image display settings will be changed,
  and clip planes will be set to their starting positions. 
  applied to the model display.  This feature is useful for revising a movie
  segment.
<LI> <B>Set to Start.</B> Press this button to change the display to match the
  start of the selected segment.  All settings in the segment will be applied,
  but the fields in the Movie dialog
  will <I>not</I> be modified.  The feature is useful for setting the endpoint
  of a segment to be added before the selected one.
<LI> <B>Set to End.</B> Press this button to change the display to match the
  end of the selected segment.  Again, fields in the Movie dialog
  will <I>not</I> be modified.  The feature is useful for setting the starting
  point of a segment to be added after the selected one.
<LI> <B>Table Fields.</B> Each row has 3 columns: the number of frames, the
  view number, and a text label.  Any cell can be edited by clicking in it and
  typing new text, or double clicking and editing the existing text.  A row is
  selected by clicking on a cell or by pressing one of the numbered buttons on
  the left.
<LI> <B>Run All.</B> This button plays the full sequence of movie segments.
  Files are written only if the <B>Write</B> checkbox is turned on in the
  Movie dialog.  The sequence can be stopped with the <B>Stop</B> button in the
  Movie dialog.  If a segment produces no change in the display, the frames
  will be saved without your having to confirm it, unlike when running Make
  for the segment itself from the Movie dialog.
<LI> <B>Save.</B> Press this button to save the table to a file.  The data are
  saved in a text file in the BL3DEMC autodoc format, which consists of
  key-value pairs.
<LI> <B>Load.</B> Press this button to read a sequence back from a file.  If
  the table contains unsaved information, you will be asked whether you want
  to save it first.
<LI> <B>Done.</B> Press this button to close the dialog.  If
  the table contains unsaved information, you will be asked whether you want
  to save it first.  The table will be empty when the dialog is reopened.
<LI> <B>Help.</B> This button brings up this help page.
