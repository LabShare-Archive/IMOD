<title>Image on Model View</title>
</head>
<A NAME = "TOP"><H3>Image View Dialog</H3></A>
This dialog allows you to display image planes on the model data.  
Any of the three native orthogonal planes can be displayed, alone or 
in combination.  Transparency can be set to allow the model to be seen
through the image; a projection through multiple slices can also be
displayed.
<P>
If data have been loaded into the program as 16-bit integers instead of bytes,
they are first converted to bytes using the scaling determined by the
the <B>Low</B> and <B>High</B> sliders in
the <A HREF="infowin.html#TOP">Information window</A>.  For best results,
be sure that the <B>Low</B> and <B>High</B> sliders are set so that images
have a good contrast with a
fairly wide range between the <B>Black</B> and <b>White</b> sliders.
Using the autocontrast function generally leaves the sliders in positions that
will allow good scaling for display.  Changing the <B>Low</B> and <B>High</B>
sliders will change the contrast of this image display.
<P>
The first three check boxes (<B>View X image</B>, etc.) turn on the 
display of the indicated image planes.  The hot key <B>Shift+Z</B> will turn on 
the Z 
image if no images are being displayed, or it will turn off all 
planes if any of them are on.
<P>
The <B>X</B>, <B>Y</B>, and <B>Z</B> sliders will track the current point 
coordinate in 
3dmod image display windows and can be used to adjust both the 
current point position and the displayed slice in the model view 
window.
<P>
The <B>X size</B>, <B>Y size</B>, and <B>Z size</B> sliders can be used to 
set the size of the image that is displayed in each dimension.  The 
displayed area will be centered on the coordinate unless that would 
result in the displayed size being smaller than the slider value.
<P>
The <B># of slices</B> slider can be used to display multiple slices.  
You will be able to see through to the last slice but not past the slices,
unless you turn on transparency.
<P>
Use the <B>Transparency</B> slider to see through the image.
<P>
The <B>Black Level</B> and <B>White Level</B> sliders can be used to 
adjust the contrast of the image.  You can reverse the contrast 
by making Black be higher than White.
<P>
Press <B>Use 3dmod Black/White</B> to set these level sliders from the
current values of the <B>Black</B> and <B>White</B> sliders in the 3dmod
Information window.
<P>
The <B>False color</B> checkbox allows images to be displayed in the 
standard false color scheme.
<P>
<I>Limitations of transparency</I>: Image transparency, model object 
transparency, and the display of multiple slices all use a similar 
method for generating transparency.  Displays will often not 
work well when you have more than one item that relies on 
this transparency method, because the items are not being drawn in 
order from back to front everywhere that they overlap.  In particular, if you
are displaying multiple slices, you will need to introduce significant image
transparency to see any transparent objects.  You may then need to adjust the
black and white level sliders in this dialog to compensate for the resulting
change in brightness or contrast of the image data.
