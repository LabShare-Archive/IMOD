The Locator Window provides an overview of the entire image area with a box
indicating the area being displayed in the most recently active Zap window.
If the rubber band is on in that Zap window, the box will show the area of the
rubber band rather than the area of the whole window.  The mouse can be used in
this window to reposition the area shown in the Zap window.
<P>
The active Zap window is the last Zap window in which a keyboard or mouse
action was taken.  Simply selecting a window or making it the focus for input
does not make it active; you need to take some action there.
<P>
The zoom of the image is set so that the whole image fits in the window.  The
window is originally sized with a zoom of 1/6.  You can change the zoom by
resizing the window.
<H3>Controls</H3>
The <B>Up</B> and <B>Down</B> arrows increase or decrease the window size, and
thus the image zoom, by a factor of 1.5.

<H3>Mouse Actions</H3>
<B>First button click:</B> Select center of the display in the Zap window.
If the rubber band is on, the rubber band is centered as close as possible to
the selected position, and the image is centered on the rubber band.
<BR><B>Second button drag:</B> Move center of the display in the Zap window.
The pointer can be anywhere in the window; it need not be within the
box.  When the button is pressed, the cursor will change to indicate the
position can be moved; then the Zap window position will be moved by the same
amount as the mouse is moved.
