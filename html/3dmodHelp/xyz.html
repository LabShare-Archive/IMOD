Descriptions below refer to the first, second, and third mouse 
buttons.  By default, these correspond to left, middle, and right 
buttons of a 3-button mouse, but you can change these assignments in 
the 3dmod Preferences dialog, accessed via the <B>Edit-Options</B> menu entry.

<A NAME = "Basics"><H3>Basic Features of the XYZ Window</H3></A>
The XYZ window displays three slices: through an XY plane in the lower
left, through a YZ plane in the lower right, and through an XZ plane in
the upper left.  The intersection of the model with these planes will
be drawn.  Marker lines and crosses indicate the position of the
current image or model point, whose coordinates determine which slices are
shown within the volume.
Clicking or dragging the mouse in the vicinity of a marker line will also
change one coordinate to the clicked location; each marker
line's color matches the color of the border around the plane whose coordinate
is changed.
When the XYZ window is resized, the window is
reapportioned between the three view boxes.
<P>
When an image plane is too large to fit in its view box, the image can be
panned with the first mouse button.  The windows do not all pan independently;
there are just three underlying pan offsets, for X, Y and Z, so that when you
pan, two windows will usually move together to keep corresponding regions of
the volume visible.
<P>
For volumes that are much larger in X and Y than in Z, the 
allocation of the window space among the three view boxes can be changed by
dragging the light blue square, at the intersection of the X and Y marker
lines.  This square will move along a diagonal so as to keep the Z sizes of
the XZ and YZ view boxes the same.
<P>
Modeling in the XYZ window is very similar to
the basic modeling that can be done in the Zap window, except that it can be
done in any of the three planes.  

<A NAME = "Toolbars"><H3>The Tool Bar</H3></A>
<UL>
<LI>The <B>up</B> and <B>down arrows</B> step the zoom factor up or down.
<LI>The <B>zoom</B> edit box shows the current zoom factor and allows 
one to type in a custom zoom.
<LI>The <B>checkerboard</B> button toggles between fast rendering and 
slower but higher quality interpolated image rendering.  When the zoom is
below 0.75, the higher quality display uses a filter to remove aliased
information, which often appears as extra noise.
<LI>The <B>lock</B> button will keep the display at the current location (and
time, if multiple image files are loaded), regardless of changes in the global
current point.  With this button on, changes in the display of this window
(using the sliders, PageUp, PageDown, the arrow hot keys, or 1 or 2 hot keys
to change time) will not affect the global current point and the display in
other windows.  Unlike in the Zap and Slicer windows, both image position and
time are locked by this single button.
<LI>The <B>Z-scale</B> button toggles between displaying voxels at the same
  scale in Z as in X and Y, and displaying them stretched by the model's
  Z-scale.  The state of this button is saved between sessions.  Once this
  setting is turned on, a new XYZ window will open with the boxes apportioned
  appropriately. The Z-scale can be set in the <A HREF =
  "modelHeader.html#TOP"> Model Header</A> dialog, opened with Edit-Model-Header.
<LI>The <B>centering</B> button will pan the images to bring the current point
as close as possible to the center of each view box.  The centered point is
either the current image point in movie mode or the current model point in
model mode.
<LI>The <B>X slider</B> allows one to change the X location.
<LI>The <B>Y slider</B> allows one to change the Y location.
<LI>The <B>Z slider</B> allows one to riffle through images or select a 
particular section to display.
</UL>

<A NAME = "HotKeys"><H3>Hot Keys Special to the XYZ Window</H3></A>
Some of these hot keys, and many others, are available in a menu that pops up
when you right-click over the XYZ window toolbar.
<UL>
<LI><B>K</B> will pan the images to bring the current point
as close as possible to the center of each view box, just as with the 
<B>centering</B> toolbar button.
<LI><B>R</B> toggles between fast rendering and 
slower but higher quality interpolated image rendering.
<LI><B>Shift-P</B> Toggles the projection of the current contour onto the side
  views. Scattered point objects are always displayed in all three views.
<LI><B>Q</B> Reports the distance between the mouse and the current image or
  model point, if the mouse is in one of the three view boxes.  The current
  model point is used in Model Mode, if one is defined.  Otherwise, distance
  is measured to the current image point in this XYZ window (which may be
  different from the global current image point).  A 3D distance is reported,
  althoughly typically it will be the same as the 2D distance in the plane.
<LI><B>Ins</B> on the keypad: In model mode, this key works the same as 
the second mouse button.  A single keystrike adds one point; 
holding the key down allows points to be added continuously.
<LI><B>Arrows</B> and <B>PageUp/PageDown</B>: These keys move the current
  viewing point relative to the plane in the box where the mouse is located,
  or relative to the XY plane if the mouse is not over a box.  For example,
  when the mouse is over the XZ box, the <B>Up arrow</B> advances in Z
  and <B>PageUp</B> advances in Y, which switches to the next XZ plane.  This
  is useful when modeling in the XZ or YZ planes.
<LI><B>Keypad Arrows</B> and <B>PageUp/PageDown</B>: In model mode, the
  numeric keypad arrow keys
  move the current model point laterally and <B>PageUp/PageDown</B> move it
  between slices, relative to the plane in the box where the mouse is
  located.  If the latter keys make a planar contour non-planar, a warning
  will be issued, because as long as this contour is the current one, new
  contours will not be made automatically when switching to a new plane or slice.
<LI><B>ESC</B> will close the XYZ window.
</UL>

<A NAME = "MovieMouse"><H3>Mouse Button Function in Movie Mode</H3></A>
<UL>
<LI><B>First Button Click</B>: Select the current image point, marked by 
a small cross in the three planes.  In one of the three view boxes, this
will change the
coordinates displayed in the other two planes.  Clicking in the horizontal
gutter region occupied by the green marker line will change the current X
coordinate and the YZ plane.  Clicking in the
vertical gutter region will select a new Y coordinate and XZ plane.  Clicking
in the upper right region will select a new Z coordinate and XY plane, as
indicated by the crossed marker lines.
<LI><B>First Button Drag</B>: In one of the three view boxes, this pans an 
image if it is larger than its view box.  In the horizontal or vertical gutter
or the upper right region, this riffles through YZ, XZ, or XY planes,
respectively.  On the small blue square at the intersection of the marker
lines, this adjusts the allocation of window space among the view boxes.
<LI><B>Second Button Click</B>: In one of the three view boxes,
start movie
through the planes in the
forward direction, or stop movie, 
<LI><B>Third Button Click</B>: In one of the three view boxes, start movie 
through the planes in the backward direction, or stop movie.
</UL>

<A NAME = "ModelMouse"><H3>Mouse Button Function in Model Mode</H3></A>
<UL>
<LI><B>First Button Click</B>: In any of the slice view boxes, this makes the nearest
visible model point be the current model point.  If there is no point nearby,
it detaches from 
the current point and contour and selects a current viewing point 
instead.  Elsewhere, this click behaves as in movie mode.  To attach to points
in any object, including ones that are turned off, there is an option in the
<B>Behavior</B> panel of the 3dmod Preferences dialog.
<LI><B>First Button Drag</B>: Pans images or riffles through planes, just as
in movie mode.
<LI><B>Second Button Click</B>: In any of the view boxes, adds one point to the
current contour or starts a new contour when modeling planar contours and the
  new point would make the current contour nonplanar.  The latter occurs when
  modeling a closed 
  contour object or an open contour object with <B>Start new contour at new
  Z</B> selected in the Edit-Object-Type dialog.  
<LI><B>Second Button Drag</B>: In any of the view boxes, continually adds points to
the current contour as the mouse is moved.
<LI><B>Third Button Click</B>: In any of the view boxes, modifies the current model
point to be at the selected position.
<LI><B>Third Button Drag</B>: In any of the view boxes, continually modifies points
as the mouse is moved.  This only works when the current model point is in the 
interior of the contour, not at its end.
</UL>

<A NAME = "MarkerLines"><H3>Marker Lines</H3></A>
The marker lines have little boxes indicating the position of the current
point, if it is visible in the image.  These can also be used as sliders, as
follows:
<UL>
<LI>Cross-hair (upper right corner):  moves the current point in Z on the
visible portion of the image.
<LI>Horizontal slider (between top and main window):  moves the current point
in X on the visible portion of the image.
<LI>Vertical slider (between top and main window):  moves the current point in
qY on the visible portion of the image.
</UL>

<A NAME = "Modeling"><H3>Modeling Meshable Contours in XZ and YZ Planes</H3></A>
It is possible to draw planar contours in
the XZ or YZ planes that can be meshed to show a surface, just like ones in
the XY planes.  There are features that facilitate this, but it requires some
attention to these details:
<UL>
<LI> The meshing code is able to connect contours that not in the XY plane
  when they are all assigned the same surface number, and when that surface
  contains only contours that lie in parallel planes.
<LI> When you start modeling a closed contour in one of the boxes, 3dmod will
  change the surface number of the contour, if necessary, to make sure that
  the surface consists only of contours in parallel planes.  This happens both
  when you create a new contour before starting to draw, and when the program
  automatically creates a new contour for you.  This behavior can be turned
  off with an option in the Behavior tab of the 3dmod Preferences dialog.
<LI> The same features can operate when you model open contours, but only if
  you select <B>Start new contour at new  Z</B> in the Edit-Object-Type dialog.
<LI> If you do not manipulate surface numbers or start a new surface yourself,
  typically contours modeled in the XY plane will be in surface 0, ones in the
  second plane that you model will be in surface 1, and ones in the other
  plane will be in surface 2.
<LI> You can still start new surfaces if you wish to use surfaces to keep track of
  different structures.
<LI> If you start modeling in a Zap window when the current contour was drawn
  in the XZ or YZ plane, 3dmod will recognize that the current surface is
  inappropriate and change to one appropriate for modeling in the XY plane. This
  is <I>not</I> the case when returning to drawing in a Zap window after
  drawing tilted contours in a Slicer window.
<LI> It is a good idea to open the Surf/Cont/Point dialog (e.g., with
  Edit-Surface-Go To) to monitor surface numbers. You can also visualize all
  of the contours in each surface by opening the Model View window and
  selecting <B>Current surface only</B> in the <B>Subsets</B> panel of the
  Edit-Objects dialog.
