<H2>XYZ Window</H2>
The XYZ window displays three slices: through an XY plane in the lower
left, through a YZ plane in the lower right, and through an XZ plane in
the upper left.  The intersection of the model with these planes will
be drawn.  Marker lines and crosses indicate the position of the
current image or model point, whose coordinates determine which slices are
shown within the volume.
Clicking or dragging the mouse in the vicinity of a marker line will also
change one coordinate to the clicked location; each marker
line's color matches the color of the border around the plane whose coordinate
is changed.
When the XYZ window is resized, the window is
reapportioned between the three view boxes.
<P>
When an image plane is too large to fit in its view box, the image can be
panned with the first mouse button.  The windows do not all pan independently;
there are just three underlying pan offsets, for X, Y and Z, so that when you
pan, two windows will usually move together to keep corresponding regions of
the volume visible.
<P>
For volumes that are much larger in X and Y than in Z, the 
The allocation of the window space among the three view boxes can be changed by
dragging the light blue square, at the intersection of the X and Y marker
lines.  This square will move along a diagonal so as to keep the Z sizes of
the XZ and YZ view boxes the same.

<H3>Mouse Button Assignments</H3>
Descriptions below refer to the first, second, and third mouse 
buttons.  By default, these correspond to left, middle, and right 
buttons of a 3-button mouse, but you can change these assignments in 
the 3dmod Preferences dialog, accessed via the <B>Edit-Options</B> menu entry.

<H3>The Tool Bar</H3>
<UL>
<LI>The <B>up</B> and <B>down arrows</B> step the zoom factor up or down.
<LI>The <B>zoom</B> edit box shows the current zoom factor and allows 
one to type in a custom zoom.
<LI>The <B>checkerboard</B> button toggles between fast rendering and 
slower but higher quality interpolated image rendering.  When the zoom is
below 0.75, the higher quality display uses a filter to remove aliased
information, which often appears as extra noise.
<LI>The <B>lock</B> button will keep the display at the current location (and
time, if multiple image files are loaded), regardless of changes in the global
current point.  With this button on, changes in the display of this window
(using the sliders, PageUp, PageDown, the arrow hot keys, or 1 or 2 hot keys
to change time) will not affect the global current point and the display in
other windows.  Unlike in the ZaP and Slicer windows, both image position and
time are locked by this single button.
<LI>The <B>centering</B> button will pan the images to bring the current point
as close as possible to the center of each view box.  The centered point is
either the current image point in movie mode or the current model point in
model mode.
<LI>The <B>X slider</B> allows one to change the X location.
<LI>The <B>Y slider</B> allows one to change the Y location.
<LI>The <B>Z slider</B> allows one to riffle through images or select a 
particular section to display.
</UL>

<H3>Hot Keys special to the XYZ window</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>k</B>will pan the images to bring the current point
as close as possible to the center of each view box, just as with the 
<B>centering</B> toolbar button.
<LI><B>r</B> toggles between fast rendering and 
slower but higher quality interpolated image rendering.
<LI><B>P</B> Toggles the projection of the current contour onto the side views.
<LI><B>Ins</B> on the keypad: In model mode, this key works the same as 
the second mouse button.  A single keystrike adds one point; 
holding the key down allows points to be added continuously.
<LI><B>ESC</B> will close the XYZ window.
</UL>
For other keys, see <A HREF = "keyboard.html">3dmod Hot Keys</A>.


<H3>Mouse button function in movie mode</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>First Button Click</B>: Select the current image point, marked by 
a small cross in the three planes.  In one of the three view boxes, this
will change the
coordinates displayed in the other two planes.  Clicking in the horizontal
gutter region occupied by the green marker line will change the current X
coordinate and the YZ plane.  Clicking in the
vertical gutter region will select a new Y coordinate and XZ plane.  Clicking
in the upper right region will select a new Z coordinate and XY plane, as
indicated by the crossed marker lines.
<LI><B>First Button Drag</B>: In one of the three view boxes, this pans an 
image if it is larger than its view box.  In the horizontal or vertical gutter
or the upper right region, this riffles through YZ, XZ, or XY planes,
respectively.  On the small blue square at the intersection of the marker
lines, this adjusts the allocation of window space among the view boxes.
<LI><B>Second Button Click</B>: In one of the three view boxes,
start movie
through the planes in the
forward direction, or stop movie, 
<LI><B>Third Button Click</B>: In one of the three view boxes, start movie 
through the planes in the backward direction, or stop movie.
</UL>

<H3>Mouse button function in model mode</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>First Button Click</B>: In the XY view box, this makes the nearest
visible model point be the current model point.  If there is no point nearby,
it detaches from 
the current point and contour and selects a current viewing point 
instead.  Elsewhere, this click behaves as in movie mode.  To attach to points
in any object, including ones that are turned off, there is an option in the
<B>Behavior</B> panel of the 3dmod Preferences dialog.
<LI><B>First Button Drag</B>: Pans images or riffles through planes, just as
in model mode.
<LI><B>Second Button Click</B>: In the XY view box, adds one point to the
current contour.
<LI><B>Second Button Drag</B>: In the XY view box, continually adds points to
the current contour as the mouse is moved.
<LI><B>Third Button Click</B>: In the XY view box, modifies the current model
point to be at the selected position.
<LI><B>Third Button Drag</B>: In the XY view box, continually modifies points
as the mouse is moved.  This only works when the current model point is in the 
interior of the contour, not at its end.
</UL>

<H3>Marker Lines</H3>
The marker lines have little boxes indicating the position of the current
point, if it is visible in the image.  These can also be used as sliders, as
follows:
<UL>
<LI>Cross-hair (upper right corner):  moves the current point in Z on the
visible portion of the image.
<LI>Horizontal slider (between top and main window):  moves the current point
in X on the visible portion of the image.
<LI>Vertical slider (between top and main window):  moves the current point in
Y on the visible portion of the image.
</UL>
