<H3>Mouse Button Assignments</H3>
Descriptions below refer to the first, second, and third mouse 
buttons.  By default, these correspond to left, middle, and right 
buttons of a 3-button mouse, but you can change these assignments in 
the 3dmod Preferences dialog, accessed via the <B>Edit-Options</B> menu entry.


<H3>The Tool Bar</H3>
<UL>
<LI>The <B>up</B> and <B>down arrows</B> step the zoom factor up or down.
<LI>The <B>zoom</B> edit box shows the current zoom factor and allows 
one to type in a custom zoom.
<LI>The <B>checkerboard</B> button toggles between fast rendering and 
slower but higher quality interpolated image rendering.
<LI>The <B>X slider</B> allow one to change the X location.
<LI>The <B>Y slider</B> allow one to change the Y location.
<LI>The <B>Z slider</B> allows one to riffle through images or select a 
particular section to display.
</UL>

<H3>Hot Keys special to the XYZ window</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>Ctrl-S</B>, <B>Shift-S</B> or <B>Ctrl-Shift-S</B> saves the Zap window,
or the area inside the rubber band, into a TIFF file, a file in the primary
non-TIFF format, or a file in the second non-TIFF format.  (Use the menu entry 
<B>Edit-Options</B> and go to the Behavior tab to select the primary non-TIFF
file format.  The second non-TIFF format will be PNG if the primary one is not
PNG, or JPEG if the primary one is PNG.)
<LI><B>r</B>, <B>Shift-R</B> toggles between fast rendering and 
slower but higher quality interpolated image rendering.
<LI><B>Shift-P</B> Projects the current contour onto the side views.
<LI><B>Ins</B> on the keypad: In model mode, this key works the same as 
the second mouse button.  A single keystrike adds one point; 
holding the key down allows points to be added continuously.
<LI><B>ESC</B> will close the XYZ window.
</UL>
For other keys, see Help - Hot Keys in the 3dmod Info Window.


<H3>Mouse button function in movie mode</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>First Button Click</B>: Select the current viewing point, marked by 
a small cross.
<LI><B>First Button Drag</B>: Pan an image if it is larger than its view box.
<LI><B>Second Button Click</B>: Start movie in forward direction, or stop movie.
<LI><B>Third Button Click</B>: Start movie in backward direction, or stop movie.
</UL>

<H3>Mouse button function in model mode</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>First Button Click</B>: Make the nearest visible model point be the 
current model point.  If there is no point nearby, this detaches from 
the current point and contour and selects a current viewing point 
instead.
<LI><B>First Button Drag</B>: Pan an image if it is larger than its view box.
<LI><B>Second Button Click</B>: Add one point to the current contour.
<LI><B>Second Button Drag</B>: Continually add points to the current 
contour as the mouse is moved.
<LI><B>Third Button Click</B>: Modify the current model point to be at the 
selected position.
<LI><B>Third Button Drag</B>: Continually modify points as the mouse is 
moved.  This only works when the current model point is in the 
interior of the contour, not at its end.
</UL>

<H3>Screen Gadgets</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Cross-hair (upper right corner):  moves the current point in Z on the visible
portion of the image.
