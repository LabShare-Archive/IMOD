<P>
Every model is initialized with one view that is continually updated as you
change the model display, and that is saved with the model.  This dialog lets
you save additional, independent views.  When you store a view, you save the
orientation, size, and lighting conditions of the whole model, and also the
color, display type, material, and other properties of all of the objects.
<P>
Click a view in the list to select and display it.
<UL>
<LI>The <B>Store</B> button stores the properties of the current display in the
currently selected view.
<LI>The <B>Revert</B> button returns the display to the stored values of the
currently selected view.
<LI>The <B>Delete</B> button deletes the currently selected view.
<LI>The <B>New View</B> button adds a new view to the list, with the properties
of the current display.
<LI>The <B>Save Model</B> button will save the model to a file and make the
existing file be a backup with extension ~.
<LI>The <B>Autostore</B> check box controls whether view changes are
automatically saved for you.  If this button is selected, the current display
properties are stored into the current view whenever you go to a different view
and whenever you save the model.  In other words, what you see is what you save,
without your having to push the <B>Store</B> button.  To return to the stored
settings of a view when operating in this mode, press the <B>Revert</B> button
or double-click on the view in the list before going on to a different view or
saving the model.  If <B>Autostore</B> is not selected, your display changes are
not saved into the current view unless you push <B>Store</B>.
</UL>
<P>
You can edit the name of the currently selected view in the edit box at the
bottom.  Press [Enter] after changing a name.
<P>
When you create a new object, its properties will be added to all of the views
when you take some action that causes views to be stored (i.e., pushing
<B>Store</B>, going to another view, or saving the model when <B>Autostore</B>
is selected).  This means that if you have more than one view, you should set
the basic object properties such as open versus closed or 3-D point size before
saving or changing views, otherwise only the current view will acquire those new
properties.
<H3>Hot keys</H3>
The regular up and down arrow keys (not the ones in the numeric keypad) can be
used to go up or down by one view, and [Page Up] and [Page Down] can be used to
go up or down in the list by many views.  [Esc] will close the dialog box, and
other keys are passed on to the model display window.
