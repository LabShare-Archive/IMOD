<H3>Model View Controls</H3>


This dialog controls model viewing and movement.
<P>
The <B>Zoom</B> arrows increase or decrease zoom factor.
<P>
The <B>Scale</B> text box shows the number of pixels on the 
screen per unit of model coordinates.  You can enter a 
specific scale to control model zoom; this is handy if you have
several models that you want to display at the same scale.
<P>
The <B>Near</B> and <B>Far clipping</B> sliders adjust the Z clipping
planes.  When 
the model is zoomed up, it will be clipped more for a given 
setting of these sliders.  To reduce undesired clipping with 
very high zooms when there is no perspective, the near clipping plane
is set three times farther out from the middle in Z when
<B>Near</B> is at 0, and the far clipping plane is set three times
farther out when <B>Far</B> is at 1000.  If there is still clipping,
you can set these planes 10 times farther out by checking 
<B>Set clipping planes farther out</B>.  This is not the default
because it may cause inappropriate clipping on some systems.
<P>
The <B>Perspective</B> slider provides for a perspective view instead of a
parallel projection of the model.  The slider sets the angle subtended
by the near clipping plane.  With perspective on, both the <B>Near
clipping</B> and the zoom setting will affect the size of the model.
The near clipping plane is not moved any farther from the model when
<B>Near</B> is at 0, but the far clipping plane is moved farther back
when it <B>Far</B> is at 1000, as described above.
<P>
The <B>Z-scale</B> slider adjusts the scale for section 
thickness relative to the pixel size in X and Y.
<P>
The <B>Rotation</B> box edits model rotation. 
The X, Y or Z axis arrow
buttons are equivalent to the hot keys on the numeric keypad.  
In addition, you can type specific angles into the text boxes.
<P>
If you press the <B>Start/Stop Rotation</B> button then one of 
the arrow buttons, the model will start rotating around the 
given axis until you press the <B>Start/Stop Rotation</B> button 
again.  Otherwise, each arrow will cause a single step 
around the given axis.
<P>
The <B>Link to top Slicer angles</B> checkbox can be used to synchronize the
rotation angles of the Model View window and the top (most recently active)
Slicer window.  When you change angles in a Slicer, the model will rotate in
Model View.  When you rotate the model, the top Slicer angles will be changed
to match.  
<P>
With <B>Link centers of rotation</B> checked also, the Slicer will
effectively rotate around the same point as the model does (at the middle
of the Model View window).  This will change the point displayed in the center
of the Slicer and generally change the current Z value displayed in other
windows.  This option is the default because it allows the Slicer view to
roll around on the surface of a cylindrical or spherical object.  Without the
option checked, Slicer angles will change but the same point will stay in the
center of the Slicer window.
<P>
The speed controls allow you adjust the rate of rotation in 
degrees per second (<B>deg/sec</B>).  Press the arrow buttons to 
increase or decrease the speed, or enter a specific value in 
the text box.
<P>
The <B>Step</B> slider sets the the step size for 
single steps with the arrows or numeric pad keys.  The same 
step size is used when rotating an object clipping plane with 
Ctrl and the keypad keys.
<P>
Note that the . and , hot keys will increase both the step 
size and rotation speed in tandem, whereas the controls in this 
dialog box allow you to adjust them independently.
