<H2>Scale Bar Dialog</H2>
This dialog box is used to control the drawing of scale bars in most image
windows and in the model view window.  The length of a bar is automatically
set to a
round number (usually, 1, 2 or 5 times a power of time) in the units of the
pixel size defined in the model header.  The dialog is opened from the
<B>Edit</B> menu of the 3dmod Informoation window, or from the 
<B>View</B> menu of the
Model View window when the program is started as 3dmodv.
<P>
The settings in this windows are stored between invocations of 3dmod along
with the user preferences, rather than in a model file.  The settings are:
<UL>
<LI><B>Draw scale bars</B> can be used to turn the scale bars on and off.  Bars
are drawn only when the dialog is open and this checkbox is on.
<LI>
<B>White bars</B> can be turned on to get white rather than black bars.  It
is not necessary to turn this on to get a white bar in the Model View window.
When the Model View window has a black or a white background, the scale bar is
automatically drawn as white or black, respectively, regardless of this
setting.
<LI>
<B>Vertical bars</B> can be turned on to get verticalinstead of horizontal
bars.
<LI>
<B>Minimum length</b> controls the size of the scale bars by specifying their
minimum length in pixels.
The smallest round number is found that gives a bar at least this long.
<LI>
<B>Thickness</B> sets the thickness of the bars in pixels.
<LI>
The <B>Position</B> combo box allows you to place the bars in any one of
the four corners of a window.
<LI>
<B>Indentation in X and Y</B> determine the distance of the bar from the
edges of the window and can be set to shift the bar farther away from
the corner in either direction.
<LI>
When <B>Make bar multiple of</B> is turned on, the bars will always be set to
the value in the spin box times a power of ten, rather than to a multiple of
1, 2, or 5.  This feature can be used to
get bars of intermediate length; for example, when a 20 nm bar is too short but
a 50 nm bar seems too long.
</UL>
At the bottom of the dialog appears a list of actual scale bar lengths in
whatever windows are open.  Values are shown for the most recently active
(top) Zap, Slicer, and Multi-Z windows, as well as for the XYZ and Model View
windows if they are open.
<P>
<B>Montage snapshots:</B> You should not need to adjust the scale bar
properties if you want to take a high-resolution montage snapshot of the Zap
or Model
View windows.  Scale bar size and indentation are automatically scaled up by
the montaging factor so that the bar will appear proportionally the same in the
snapshot as in the original window.  In each case, the actual length of the
scale bar for the montage is printed on the terminal, since it is possible
that the length would be different from that in the original window.
