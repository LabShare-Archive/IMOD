<A NAME = "TOP"><H2>Tumbler Window</H2></A>
The tumbler window displays a projected view of a rectangular portion
of the image volume.  The subset is initially a small cube but the size 
can be changed with the X, Y and Z spin button controls.  The volume 
can be rotated with the keypad arrow keys just as in 3dmodv.
<P>
The intensity adjustment of the projected image may not work very well.  If the
image appears saturated, spread out the <B>Black</B> and <b>White</b> sliders
in the <A HREF="infowin.html#TOP">Information window</A>.
<P>
If data have been loaded into the program as 16-bit integers instead of bytes,
they are first converted to bytes using the scaling determined by the
the <B>Low</B> and <B>High</B> sliders in the Info window.  For best results,
be sure that the <B>Low</B> and <B>High</B> sliders are set so that images
have a good contrast with a
fairly wide range between the <B>Black</B> and <b>White</b> sliders.
<P>
<H3>Toolbar Controls</H3>
The <B>zoom</B> spin box lets you increase, decrease, or type in a zoom 
factor.
<P>
The <B>checkerboard</B> toggles between low resolution rendering with 
nearest-neighbor interpolation and high-resolution rendering with 
quadratic interpolation.
<P>
The <B>lock</B> button will lock the X/Y/Z position of the volume.
The X, Y, and Z spin controls allow you to change the size of any 
dimension of the volume.
<P>
The <B>Black</B> and <B>White</B> threshold sliders allow you to cut out 
extraneous image material by setting all pixels in the volume with 
values below the black threshold to 0, and all pixels with values above 
the white threshold to 255.
