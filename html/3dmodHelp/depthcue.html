<A NAME = "TOP"><H3>Depth Cue Dialog</H3></A>

Depth cueing is implemented by having objects blend into the 
background color with increasing distance from the viewer.  
The range of distances over which this blending occurs is
controlled by the sliders.
<P>
The <B>Starting depth</B> slider controls the distance at which the blending
starts - everything in front of this distance will not be
fogged.  Typically you would move this slider until the frontmost
features in your model appear at full intensity.
<P>
The <B>Ending depth</B> slider controls the distance beyond which everything
will disappear.  Move this slider to change how fast the blending
into the background occurs.
<P>
Use the <B>Depth Cue</B> checkbox to turn the cueing on and off.
