<H2>Model View Mouse Controls</H2>
<P>
By default, the first button referred to here is the left mouse button and the
second button is the middle button.  
These two buttons can be switched using an option in the 3dmod Preferences
dialog, accessed via the <B>Edit-Options</B> menu entry in the 3dmod Info
Window.

<H4>Moving/Rotating/Zooming the Model</H4>
<DL>
<DT>First Mouse Button Drag
<DD>The first mouse button moves the model when held down.
<DT>Second Mouse Button Drag
<DD>The second mouse button rotates the model around an axis perpendicular to
the direction of motion of the mouse.  It can also be used to "throw" the model
in a new direction if the model is already rotating automatically, or if a
button or hot key has been pressed to start rotation.  The model will rotate
continuously in the direction of movement, and the speed of rotation will be
proportional to the distance moved.  (Moving 100 pixels will make it rotate at
the standard speed.)
<DT>[Shift] + Right Mouse Button Drag
<DD>The right mouse button together with the Shift key can be used to rotate
the model around the viewing (Z) axis.
<DT>Scroll Wheel
<DD>The scroll wheel zooms the model display up or down.

<H4>Moving/Rotating a Clipping Plane</H4>
<DL>
<DT>[Ctrl] + First Mouse Button Drag
<DD>When the Ctrl key is held down, the first mouse button moves the current
clipping plane.
<DT>[Ctrl] + Second Mouse Button Drag
<DD>When the Ctrl key is held down, the second mouse button rotates the current
object clipping plane around an axis perpendicular to
the direction of motion of the mouse.
<DT>[Ctrl] + [Shift] + Right Mouse Button Drag
<DD>When both the Ctrl and the Shift key are held down, the right mouse 
button rotates the current clipping plane around the viewing (Z) axis.
</DL>
<H4>Moving the Light Source</H4>
<DL>
<DT>[Shift] + Second Mouse Button Drag
<DD>When the Shift key is held down, the second mouse button rotates the light
source instead instead of the model.
</DL>
<H4>Selecting Points and Contours</H4>
<DL>
<DT>Right Mouse Button Click
<DD>When running Model View from 3dmod, clicking on a point in the model with
the right mouse button will select the nearest, frontmost point in the model as
the current model point within 3dmod.
<DT>[Ctrl] + Right Mouse Button Click or Drag
<DD>Multiple contours can be selected by holding the Ctrl key down; click on a
contour to add it to the set of selected contours or to remove it from the set
if it is already selected.  Dragging the mouse with the right button down and
the Ctrl key down will add contours that are crossed by the mouse to the set of
selected contours.  Note that Ctrl-A can also be used to select all contours
that are being drawn in the current object (excluding ones that are completely
clipped).
