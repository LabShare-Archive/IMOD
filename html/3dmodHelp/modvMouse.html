<DT>Left Mouse Button Drag
<DD>The left mouse button moves the model when held down.
<DT>[Ctrl] + Left Mouse Button Drag
<DD>When the Ctrl key is held down the left mouse button moves the current
object clipping plane.
<DT>Middle Mouse Button Drag
<DD>The middle mouse button rotates the model around an axis perpendicular to
the direction of motion of the mouse.  It can also be used to "throw" the model
in a new direction if the model is already rotating automatically, or if a
button or hot key has been pressed to start rotation.  The model will rotate
continuously in the direction of movement, and the speed of rotation will be
proportional to the distance moved.  (Moving 100 pixels will make it rotate at
the standard speed.)
<DT>[Shift] + Middle Mouse Button Drag
<DD>When the Shift key is held down the middle mouse button rotates the light
source instead.
<DT>[Ctrl] + Middle Mouse Button Drag
<DD>When the Ctrl key is held down the middle mouse button rotates the current
object clipping plane instead.
<DT>Right Mouse Button
<DD>When running Model View from 3dmod, clicking on a point in the model with
the right mouse button will select the nearest, frontmost point in the model as
the current model point within 3dmod.
<DT>[Ctrl] + Right Mouse Button
<DD>Multiple contours can be selected by holding the Ctrl key down; click on a
contour to add it to the set of selected contours or to remove it from the set
if it is already selected.  Dragging the mouse with the right button down and
the Ctrl key down will add contours that are crossed by the mouse to the set of
selected contours.  Note that Ctrl-A can also be used to select all contours
that are being drawn in the current object (excluding ones that are completely
clipped).
