<A NAME = "TOP"><H2>Pixel View Window</H2></A>
The pixel view window presents a grid of 7 by 7 buttons showing the
image value at each pixel around the current point.  In addition, at
the top of window is a continuous display of the pixel value
at the current mouse position in whichever window it is located.  The
pixel values can be the actual values in the image file, or the byte values
in program memory, which may have been scaled from the values in the file.
<P>
If you press a button in the grid, that pixel becomes the current
point, which is then moved to the middle of the grid.  The buttons
colored red and blue contain the highest and lowest values out of those
displayed.
<P>
The controls at the top are as follows:
<P>
<B>File value</B>: Turn this box on to have the 
continuous readout of pixel value at the mouse position come from the
image file instead of from program memory.  Taking data rapidly from
random positions in the file could be problematic with a large file or
slow access.  If it is not possible to read single-pixel values from
the current image file, this box will be grayed out and data will be
taken from memory.
<P>
<B>Grid</B>: Turn this box off to have a small window with just the
continuous readout.
<P>
<B>Grid value from file</B>: Turn this box off to have the grid values
taken from memory instead of from the image file.  If it is not
possible to read single-pixel values from the current
image file, this box will be grayed out and data will be taken from
memory.
<P>
<B>Convert RGB to gray scale</B>: When color images are loaded, the grid
will show the red, green, and blue components.  Turn this box on to
see a single gray scale value, converted with the standard NTSC RGB to
luminance conversion used elsewhere in IMOD.
