<H3>Model View Object Edit</H3>

This dialog box contains many controls for changing how individual objects are
displayed, as well as some features governing the overall model display.
The top sections contains some general controls and the bottom section shows
one out of several available panels with more specialized controls.

<H4>General Controls</H4>
Select the current object with the <B>Object</B> spin box or the slider.
<P>
The <B>Edit</B> Each/All/On's option menu allows one to edit just the current
object, all objects at once, or just the objects that are
currently turned On.  Features that can be edited in tandem for
many objects include: point size, line width, material
properties, and drawing data type and style.  Line color can also be
changed in tandem if a separate check box is selected.
<P>
The name of each object can be edited using the text edit box.
<P>
The numbered check boxes allow one to conveniently turn selected
objects on and off.  When an object is turned on, it becomes the
current object.  Only 48 checkboxes will be displayed here; if you have more
objects, use the Edit - Object List menu entry to bring up a complete Object 
List window.
<P>
The <B>Draw Data Type</B> option selects which type of data to draw.
You can select to draw contour data, mesh data or no data at all.
<P>
The <B>Drawing Style</B> option selects the drawing style.
You can select between drawing points, lines, filled or
filled outline.
<P>
To select which parameter group is displayed in the panel in the lower right
part of the window,
use the mouse to select one of the entries in the list box in the lower left.
The controls in each group are listed below.

<H4>Line color</H4>
Use the <B>Red</B>, <B>Green</B>, and <B>Blue</B> sliders to adjust the
line color of the current object.  This also sets the
fill color unless a separate color is selected in the <B>Fill Color</B> panel.
The <B>Transparency</B> slider selects object
transparency.  Transparency is only an approximation and can
easily generate artifacts.  To minimize these artifacts, the back
face of the object will not be displayed unless the
<B>Light Both Sides</B> button is selected in the 
<B>Material</B> panel.  Try it both ways to see which looks best. 
<P>
By default, color changes will be applied to only one object in one
model.  Check <B>Change multiple objects</B> to modify more than one object
at a time.   The setting of the <B>Edit</B> combo box and the <B>Edit</B>
radio buttons in the Model Edit window will then control which objects
are changed together with the current object.

<H4>Fill color</H4>
Use the sliders to adjust the fill color of the current object. 
Select <B>Use fill color</B> to have this color used instead of the line
color whenever the object is being displayed as filled.  Select
<B>Use for spheres</B> to have the fill color used just for display of
spheres.  This would allow you to have a surface of one color studded with
spheres of another color at selected points.

<H4>Material</H4>
The <B>Ambient</B> slider adjusts ambient, or non-directional, light
hitting the object.
The <B>Diffuse</B> slider adjusts light hitting the object from the
light source, which then diffuses in a direction-dependent way. 
The <B>Shininess</B> and <B>Specularity</B> sliders together adjust the
shininess or highlights of the object.
<P>
Select <B>Light Both Sides</B> to have the object
lit on both its outside and inside surfaces.  If you just want to have the
inside surface show up less dark than it does by default, try increasing the 
<B>Ambient</B> value and decreasing the <B>Diffuse</B> value to compensate.

<H4>Points</H4>
This panel controls the rendering of spheres that are displayed at individual
points.  The sphere radius can be incremented, decremented, or typed
into the spin box.  Note that setting the radius non-zero will cause
points to be displayed at each point, even for open and closed contour
objects.  The quality of the spheres is controlled by the
two quality spin boxes, one to set the quality for the particular
object, and one to set the overall minimum quality for all objects. 
The display quality for an object is the maximum of its own
quality setting and the global setting (range 1 - 4).  The global
setting can also be controlled by the g and G hot keys.

<H4>Lines</H4>
The <B>2D Line Width</B> slider changes the line width used when drawing the 
model in image display windows in 3dmod.  The <B>3D Line Width</B> slider
changes the line width used to draw 
draw the objects in the model view window.  
The <B>Anti-alias rendering</B> check box
selects anti-alias rendering for lines. 
Lines will look smoother with this option on; however,
some artifacts may be noticed.  The <B>Thicken current contour</B> check
box can be used to highlight the current contour by drawing it thicker
than other contours.  This will
have an effect only for objects whose drawing style is <B>Lines</B>. 
This feature is most useful when using the third mouse button to select
contours.

<H4>Mesh View</H4>
This is a special control group used for
viewing meshes that have scalar data, such as to represent
surface density.  The feature is enabled by selecting <B>Show
normal magnitudes</B>.  The sliders adjust the contrast range
of the displayed values, and <B>False color</B> will display the
values with a false color rather than gray scale intensity
ramp.

<H4>Clip</H4>
These controls allow you to set up clipping planes for an
individual
object as well as global clipping planes that will be applied to all
objects.  Use the <B>Object</B> and <B>Global</B> radio buttons to select
whether to adjust global planes or planes for the current object. 
If you want the current object to be clipped only by its own planes
and not by any global planes, turn on <B>Skip global planes</B>. 
The spin box allows you to select the current plane, the one that is
adjusted by the remaining controls.  Use <B>Clipping plane ON</B> to
toggle the current clipping plane on or off.  The
<B>Reset</B> button moves the plane back to its default location and
orientation through the middle of the object or model.  The <B>Invert</B>
 button inverts the direction of the clipping plane.
<P>
Once the current plane is turned on, hold down the Ctrl key
to move and rotate the plane instead of the model.  Use the left mouse
button or the arrow keys to move the plane, and the middle mouse button
or the keypad keys to rotate the plane.
<P>
Up to 6 clipping planes may be defined for each object, as well as 6
global planes.  However, the OpenGL implementation on your machine
limits the total number of planes that can be applied to an object. 
There are guaranteed to be at least 6 but probably are only 6.  If this
limit comes into play, object planes count first toward the limit.

<H4>Move</H4>
This panel allows one to view orthogonal faces of the model. 
Each column of buttons will move by 90 degree rotations about
one of the three axes. 
The <B>Center on Object</B> button will center the display on the 
current object.

<H4>Subsets</H4>
This panel allows one to view the current object, surface or
contour of the model, if one is selected.  <B>Current Surface
Only</B> or <B>Current Contour Only</B> will show only the current
surface or contour in the current object.  <B>Surface & Other
Objects</B> or <B>Contour & Other Objects</B> will show the current
surface or contour in the current object, plus all other objects
that are turned on.
