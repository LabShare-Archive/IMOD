<A NAME = "TOP"><H2>Model View Object Edit</H2></A>

This dialog box contains many controls for changing how individual objects are
displayed, as well as some features governing the overall model display.
The top sections contains some general controls and the bottom section shows
one out of several available panels with more specialized controls.

<BR><A HREF = "#Line color">Line color</A>
<BR><A HREF = "#Fill color">Fill color</A>
<BR><A HREF = "#Material">Material</A>
<BR><A HREF = "#Points">Points</A>
<BR><A HREF = "#Lines">Lines</A>
<BR><A HREF = "#Values">Values</A>

<A NAME = "General Controls"><H3>General Controls</H3></A>
Select the current object with the <B>Object</B> spin box or the slider.
<P>
The <B>Edit</B> Each/All/On's/Group option menu allows one to edit just the 
current
object, all objects at once, just the objects that are
currently turned On, or objects belonging to a group selected in the Object
List window.  Features that can be edited in tandem for
many objects include: point size, line width, material
properties, drawing data type and style, and meshing parameters.  Line color
can also be changed in tandem if a separate check box is selected.
When <B>On's</B> is
selected, and the current object is not On, then it will not be changed, but
a nearby object that was changed will be made the current one so that the
dialog can reflect your change.  Similar behavior occurs when <B>Group</B> is
selected and the current object is not a member of the group defined in the
Object List window.  For a feature that
cannot be edited in multiple objects, this setting has no effect - the
current object is the only one changed.
<P>
The name of each object can be edited using the text edit box.
<P>
The numbered check boxes allow one to conveniently turn selected
objects on and off.  When an object is turned on, it becomes the
current object.  Only 48 checkboxes will be displayed here; if you have more
objects, use the Edit - Object List menu entry to bring up a complete Object 
List window.
<P>
The <B>Draw Data Type</B> option selects which type of data to draw.
You can select to draw contour data or mesh data.  There is also an entry
to turn drawing <B>Off</B>, and an entry to turn the drawing back <B>On</B>
without having to select contour or mesh type.  The latter is useful when you
want to turn all items back on after turning them off.
<P>
The <B>Drawing Style</B> option selects the drawing style.
You can select between drawing points, lines, filled or
filled outline.
<P>
To select which parameter group is displayed in the panel in the lower right
part of the window,
use the mouse to select one of the entries in the list box in the lower left.
The controls in each group are listed below.

<A NAME = "Line color"><H3>Line color</H3></A>
Use the <B>Red</B>, <B>Green</B>, and <B>Blue</B> sliders to adjust the
line color of the current object.  This also sets the
fill color unless a separate color is selected in the <B>Fill Color</B> panel.
The <B>Transparency</B> slider selects object
transparency.  Transparency is only an approximation and can
easily generate artifacts.  To minimize these artifacts, the back
face of the object will not be displayed unless the
<B>Light Both Sides</B> button is selected in the 
<B>Material</B> panel.  Try it both ways to see which looks best. 
<P>
By default, color changes will be applied to only one object in one
model.  Check <B>Change multiple objects</B> to modify more than one object
at a time.   The setting of the <B>Edit</B> combo box and the <B>Edit</B>
radio buttons in the Model Edit window will then control which objects
are changed together with the current object.

<A NAME = "Fill color"><H3>Fill color</H3></A>
Use the sliders to adjust the fill color of the current object. 
Select <B>Use fill color</B> to have this color used instead of the line
color whenever the object is being displayed as filled.  Select
<B>Use for spheres</B> to have the fill color used just for display of
spheres.  This would allow you to have a surface of one color studded with
spheres of another color at selected points.

<A NAME = "Material"><H3>Material</H3></A>
The <B>Ambient</B> slider adjusts ambient, or non-directional, light
hitting the object.
The <B>Diffuse</B> slider adjusts light hitting the object from the
light source, which then diffuses in a direction-dependent way. 
The <B>Shininess</B> and <B>Specularity</B> sliders together adjust the
shininess or highlights of the object.
<P>
Select <B>Light Both Sides</B> to have the object
lit on both its outside and inside surfaces.  If you just want to have the
inside surface show up less dark than it does by default, try increasing the 
<B>Ambient</B> value and decreasing the <B>Diffuse</B> value to compensate.

<A NAME = "Points"><H3>Points</H3></A>
This panel controls the rendering of spheres that are displayed at individual
points.  The sphere radius can be incremented, decremented, or typed
into the spin box.  Note that setting the radius non-zero will cause
points to be displayed at each point, even for open and closed contour
objects.  The quality of the spheres is controlled by the
two quality spin boxes, one to set the quality for the particular
object, and one to set the overall minimum quality for all objects. 
The display quality for an object is the maximum of its own
quality setting and the global setting (range 1 - 4).  The global
setting can also be controlled by the <B>G</B> and <B>Shift+G</B> hot keys.

<A NAME = "Lines"><H3>Lines</H3></A>
This panel has controls that affect the drawing of lines in the model view
window, as well as some other object properties that you might want to 
change for multiple objects at once.
<UL>
<LI> The <B>2D Line Width</B> slider changes the line width used when drawing the model in image display windows in 3dmod. 
<LI> The <B>3D Line Width</B> slider
changes the line width used to draw 
draw the objects in the model view window.  
<LI> The <B>Anti-alias rendering</B> check box
selects anti-alias rendering for lines. 
Lines will look smoother with this option on; however,
some artifacts may be noticed.
<LI> The <B>Thicken current contour</B> check
box can be used to highlight the current contour by drawing it thicker
than other contours.  This will
have an effect only for objects whose drawing style is <B>Lines</B>. 
This feature is most useful when using the third mouse button to select
contours.
<LI> The <B>Open object type</B> check box is enabled when the object type is
closed or open, and can be used to switch objects between open and closed.  If
the <B>Edit</B> combo box is set to <B>All</B> or <B>On's</b>, then changing 
this setting for the current object will affect all open and closed
contour objects, or all that are turned on.
<LI> The <B>New contour at new Z</B> check box is enabled for open contour
objects and controls whether a new contour is started automatically when 
drawing on a new section in the Zap window.  If
the <B>Edit</B> combo box is set to <B>All</B> or <B>On's</b>, then changing 
this setting for the current object will affect all open
contour objects, or all that are turned on.
</UL>

<A NAME = "Values"><H3>Values</H3></A>
This panel controls the display of values that have been stored in the
model in one of two ways.  Some programs will now store values for
each contour or point using the fine-grained storage capabilities.
The sda program stored surface density values in the mesh as the
magnitude of the surface normals.  The radio buttons at the top allow
you to select whether to <B>Show stored values</B> or to
<B>Show normal magnitudes</B>.  
<P>
The <B>Black</B> and <B>White</B> sliders adjust the contrast range
of the displayed values.  The intensity ramp can be inverted by setting the
<B>Black</B> slider higher than the <B>White</B> one. 
<P> 
By default, the values
will be shown as an intensity modulation of the
object's color.  Use the <B>False color</B> checkbox to display the
values in false color instead.  Alternatively, the <B>Fixed color</B> checkbox
can be used to keep the color constant instead of modulating it with the
stored values.
<P>
The <B>Turn off Low</B> and <B>High</B> buttons can be used to turn off the
drawing of contours or points whose stored values fall below the lower of the
Black and White levels or above the higher of the two levels, respectively.
This feature does not work for mesh displays.  If you do not
want to view values in false color, you can used the <B>Fixed color</B> option
to distinguish clearly between items below and above the low threshold
(otherwise, items just above the threshold will be too dark to see).
<P>
Note that once the drawing of stored values is turned on, it is applied
to model features drawn in the image display windows, if any.
<A NAME = "Clip"><H3>Clip</H3></A>
These controls allow you to set up clipping planes for an
individual
object as well as global clipping planes that will be applied to all
objects.  The position and orientation of a plane is adjusted by
holding down the Ctrl key and doing the same operations that would
ordinarily move or rotate the model.
<P>
The controls at the top of the panel affect the behavior of the program rather
than applying to the current object.  Select <B>Show current plane</B> to have
the current plane drawn as a semi-transparent plane so that you can see its
position better.  When you switch planes or objects, you will see the new
current plane, if any.
Use the <B>Object</B> and <B>Global</B> radio buttons to select
whether to adjust global planes or planes for the current object. 
<P>
The remaining controls affect stored properties of the global clipping planes,
or the current object and its
clipping planes.
If you want the current object to be clipped only by its own planes
and not by any global planes, turn on <B>Skip global planes</B>. 
The <B>Plane #</B> spin box allows you to select the current plane, the one
that is adjusted by the remaining controls.  
Use <B>Clipping plane ON</B> to toggle the current clipping plane on or off.
The <B>Plane #</B> spin box always allows you to select
one plane past the highest one that has already been defined, so you can add
another plane just by selecting the next available number and turning the
plane on.
<P>
The <B>Reset X, Y, Z</B> buttons move the plane back to its default location
through the middle of the object or model and orient it perpendicular to the
X, Y or Z axis.  The <B>Invert</B>
button inverts the direction of the clipping plane.
Turn on <B>Adjust all planes</B> to operate on all of the object or
global planes at once; these operations include moving, rotating, and
turning on or off.  This option is useful if you have set up several
planes to enclose a box and want to shift or rotate the box as a unit.
<P>
Once the current plane is turned on, hold down the Ctrl key
to move and rotate the plane instead of the model.  Use the left mouse
button or the arrow keys to move the plane, and the middle mouse button
or the keypad keys to rotate the plane.
<P>
Up to 6 clipping planes may be defined for each object, as well as 6
global planes.  However, the OpenGL implementation on your machine
limits the total number of planes that can be applied to an object. 
There are guaranteed to be at least 6 but probably are only 6.  If this
limit comes into play, object planes count first toward the limit.

<A NAME = "Move"><H3>Move</H3></A>
This panel allows one to view orthogonal faces of the model. 
Each column of buttons will move by 90 degree rotations about
one of the three axes. 
The <B>Center on Object</B> button will center the display on the 
current object.

<A NAME = "Subsets"><H3>Subsets</H3></A>
This panel allows one to view the current object, surface or
contour of the model, if one is selected, or just the current point in a
scattered point object.  <B>Current Surface
Only</B> or <B>Current Contour Only</B> will show only the current
surface or contour in the current object.  <B>Surface & Other
Objects</B> or <B>Contour & Other Objects</B> will show the current
surface or contour in the current object, plus all other objects
that are turned on.  <B>Point & Other Objects</B> is available only when the
current object type is scattered points and will show only the current
point in the current object, along with all other objects that are turned on.

<A NAME = "Meshing"><H3>Meshing</H3></A>
This panel allows the current object to be meshed if it is an open or closed
object.  The various controls correspond to options in 
<A HREF = "../man/imodmesh.html#TOP">Imodmesh</A>; see that man page 
for more details.  If the object has been meshed before, the
parameters for that meshing will be used to set these controls.  In addition,
any parameters set through Imodmesh but not appearing here, such as X or Y
limits or lists of Z values to not cap to, will still be
applied when remeshing through this interface.  If you changing the meshing
parameters for more than one object (i.e., with an <B>Edit</B> option of with
editing of multiple models enabled), then an object will be changed only if
the particular parameter change is relevant for that kind of object or
appropriate given the other parameters set for that object.
<P>
The controls are:
<UL>
<LI><B>Skip:</B> Connect contours across sections with no contours (-s
option).
<LI><B>Tube:</B> Make a tubular mesh around open contours (-t option).
<LI><B>Low res:</B> Make a low resolution mesh separate from the regular one
  and keep the regular mesh (-l option).  Once a low resolution mesh has been
  made, the only way to delete is to run 
<A HREF =  "../man/imodmesh.html#TOP">Imodmesh</A> with the -l and -e options.
<LI><B>Surface:</B> Use surface numbers for connections; only connect contours
in the same surface (-S option).
<LI><B>Cap:</B> Normally, cap all unconnected ends of the object (-C option).
When <B>Tube</B> is selected, this checkbox controls whether the ends of tubes
are capped (-E option).
<LI><B>Dome cap:</B> When <B>Tube</B> is selected, you can use this option to
get hemispherical caps on the ends of tubes (-H option).  It is not necessary
to turn on <B>Cap</B> also.
<LI><B>Passes:</B> Number of passes for connecting contours farther apart in Z
(-P option).
<LI><B>Diam:</B> Diameter for tube meshing (-D option).  If the value is 0,
the 3D line width will be used; for -1 or negative numbers between 0 and -1,
the sphere size will be used; for -2 or negative numbers less than -1, the symbol
size will be used.
<LI><B>Tol:</B> Tolerance for point reduction; points will be removed if they
are within this distance of the remaining lines (-R option).  A separate value
is maintained for regular and low resolution meshing.
<LI><B>Z inc:</B> Increment in Z at which to mesh contours (-i option).  A
separate value is maintained for regular and low resolution meshing.
<LI><B>Flat crit:</B> Criterion Z extent of contours; if any contours vary by
more than this amount in Z, then each surface will be analyzed for the
orientation of its contours and the tilted contours will be meshed (-F
option).  A value of 0 disables the analysis.
<LI><B>Z:</B> Starting and ending Z of range over which to mesh, numbered from
1 (-z option, except that is numbered from 0).  Enter a single number to mesh
a single pair of planes, as long as the Z increment is 1; e.g., "23" will mesh
sections 23 and 24.
</UL>
Pressing <B>Mesh One</b> will start the meshing on the current object on a
separate thread, so you
can continue using the program before the mesh is done.  When the mesh is
done, the drawing of the object will be switched to Mesh and Fill if
appropriate.  The resolution mode will be switched to match the resolution of
the mesh just computed.  Note that the hot key <B>Ctrl+R</B> is used to switch between
resolutions.
<P>
Pressing <B>Mesh All</B> will mesh all closed and open contour objects in the
model.  The meshing parameters used for each object will be the ones defined
for that object, if it has been meshed before, or it will be the default
parameters that you would see in this panel if you switched to that object.
The parameters visible for the current object are not necessarily the defaults
for the other objects.
