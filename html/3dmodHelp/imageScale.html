The Image Scale dialog is used to reload images with a different scaling.  It
can be used when the data have too great a dynamic range and
the features of interest are not being displayed with sufficient gray
levels.  It can also be used to bring multiple image files to a common
scaling for comparison.
<P>
At the top of the window appear the current filename and the minimum,
maximum, and mean values from the image file header.  If there are
multiple image files loaded, these entries will be updated when the
current file is changed.
<P>
The <B>Lower limit</B> and <B>Upper limit</B> are used to scale
the image pixel values linearly to the 8-bit display; values between
the lower and the upper value are scaled to the range 0 to 255, and
values outside this range are truncated as black or white.
When you first open the window, these values are set based upon
the current position of the contrast sliders, so that if the 
image is reloaded, it will have the same apparent contrast with 
the sliders set to 32 and 223.
<P>
The <B>Apply</B> button will reload the image with the given limits
AND set the contrast sliders to 32 and 223.
<P>
The <B>Calc</B> button will recalculate suggested lower and upper limits
based upon new settings of the contrast sliders.
Thus, you can either type in new lower and upper limits, or use
the sliders and <B>Calc</B> button to set the limits.
<P>
All data for the current file are reloaded with the given scaling, unless
data are loaded into the image cache and the cache is not being kept
full.  In that case, the data in the cache are flushed but
only the current image will be reloaded with the new scaling.
