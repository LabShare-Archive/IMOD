<LI><B>Set Snap Dir...</B>:&emsp;Set a directory to put snapshots into.  The
same directory will be used for model snapshots.

selected by the rubber band in the top Zap window, using the trimvol command
that would be produced with the <B>I</B> button in that window.  Flipping is
included if the image is loaded flipped.  A single 
slice is extracted if the <B>Lo</B> and <B>Hi</B> fields are empty; otherwise
those fields specify the range in Z.
