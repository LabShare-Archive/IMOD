<P>
This dialog allows one to copy the current contour, or mutiple selected contours,
to a selected section, object or time index.  If copying to a
section or time index, only contours matching the section number or time of the
current contour will be copied.
<P>
The selection box provides options for copying contours to a particular object,
to a particular section, or to a different time index.  In each of these cases,
the spin box will be active and allow you to select or enter the number of the
object, section, or time the contours will be copied to.  In addition, you can
select copying to the next or previous section, or duplicating contours on the
same section.  In these cases the spin box is inactive.
<P>
The radio buttons determine the number of contours copied.  The standard choices
are to copy just currently selected contours, all contours with the same
surface number, or all contours in the object.  With the first choice,
multiple contours can be copied at once by selecting them with Ctrl and the
first mouse button, or with the Ctrl+A or Ctrl+Shift+A hot keys (which select
all contours on the section in the current object, or all objects,
respectively).  Only those
selected contours in the current object and on the same section as the current
contour will be duplicated or copied to another object; but for copying to
another section or time, selected contours from multiple objects can
be copied.  Again, only those contours matching the section
or time index of the current contour will be copied when copying to a section or
time index, while all eligible contours in an object will be copied when copying
to another object.  When copying to a time index, another option is available,
to copy all contours in all objects from the current time index to the selected
time index.

<LI>Push <B>Apply</B> to execute the copy operation using the current
  settings.  The hot key for this operation is <B>K</B>; it is available as
  long as this dialog is open (but not from the Slicer or XYZ window
  where <B>K</B> does something else).
<LI>Push <B>Done</B> to close the dialog without doing any copy operation.
