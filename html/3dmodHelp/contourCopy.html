<H2>Contour Copy</H2>
<P>
This dialog allows one to copy the current contour, or selected contours in the
current object to a selected section, object or time index.  If copying to a
section or time index, only contours matching the section number or time of the
current contour will be copied.
<P>
The selection box provides options for copying contours to a particular object,
to a particular section, or to a different time index.  In each of these cases,
the spin box will be active and allow you to select or enter the number of the
object, section, or time the contours will be copied to.  In addition, you can
select copying to the next or previous section, or duplicating contours on the
same section.  In these cases the spin box is inactive.
<P>
The radio buttons determine the number of contours copied.  The standard choices
are to copy just the current contour, all contours with the same surface number,
or all contours in the object.  Again, only those contours matching the section
or time index of the current contour will be copied when copying to a section or
time index, while all eligible contours in an object will be copied when copying
to another object.  When copying to a time index, another option is available,
to copy all contours in all objects from the current time index to the selected
time index.
