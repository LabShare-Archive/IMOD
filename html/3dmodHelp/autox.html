<A NAME = "TOP"><H2>Auto Contour</H2></A>
Auto contour creates closed contours that belong to the current object.  The
contours surround areas that  are either above or below a selected threshold.
<P>
To start using it, switch to High Contrast to see what areas fall above or
below threshold.  Adjust the threshold to the proper level to segment your
features of interest, switching back and forth between Regular and High
contrast as needed.  High Contrast uses the second color ramp, so you can
toggle between these views easily by using hot key F9 to switch back to the
first ramp, and hot key F10 to switch from the first to the second ramp.
Select the Alternate mouse to use the mouse buttons to control the filling
operation.  Then click on the interior of a desired area to flood that area in
red.  Adjust the area if necessary then press the Build button or the B hot key
to build a contour around the area.
<P>
If you are in High Contrast mode, you should turn off the <B>Float</B> button
in the 3dmod Information window unless you want the threshold from change when
you go from section to section.
<P>
Image data are always analyzed as 8-bit bytes, even when they have been loaded
into the program as 16-bit integers.  In the latter case, the current setting
of the <B>Low</B> and <B>High</B> sliders in
the <A HREF="infowin.html#TOP">Information window</A> determines how data are
scaled to bytes.  For best results, be sure that the <B>Low</B>
and <B>High</B> sliders are set so that images have a good contrast with a
fairly wide range between the <B>Black</B> and <b>White</b> sliders.
Using the autocontrast function generally leaves the sliders in positions that
will allow good scaling for autocontouring.  Note that the threshold setting
changes it meaning when the <B>Low</B> and <B>High</B> sliders are changed.
<P>
If you find that you can obtain usable contours with this approach, you can
run the same operation on a defined region of the image stack using
<A HREF = "../man/imodauto.html#TOP">Imodauto</A>.  A given threshold should have
the same effect with that program as in this window, provided that data are
loaded with the same intensity scaling.  The scaling will be the same by
default, but if you set the scaling when loading data into 3dmod, you will
need to use the same scaling when running Imodauto.  However, if data are
loaded into the program as 16-bit integers, use the setting of the <B>Low</B>
and <B>High</B> sliders as the scaling values when running Imodauto.
<P>
Smoother contours may be obtained by applying smoothing in the 
<A HREF = "imageProc.html#TOP">image processing
window</A>.  To use this approach, select the smoothing panel and try 
different sigma values.  Be sure to uncheck <B>Rescale to match min/max</B> so
that the smoothed data will have consistent intensities from section to
section, and will correspond to the intensity values if you use smoothing
in Imodauto.  You can check <B>Autoapply</B> to have the smoothing happen
automatically when you go from one section from the next.

<LI><B>Contrast</B>:  <B>Regular</B> contrast shows the image data, <B>High</B>
contrast shows the threshold level.
<LI>The <B>Threshold</B> slider controls the grey level that segments the data.
<LI>The <B>Resolution</B> slider controls point reduction in the generated
contour. Points are originally created at intervals of about 1 pixel.  Points
are removed if they are within this distance of a line segment between the
remaining points.
<LI>The <B>Alternate mouse</B> checkbox allows the use of alternate mouse
functions:
<UL><LI>First  - Select area by flooding around point.
<LI>Second - Add pixel to flood area (it will appear as yellow).
<LI>Third  - Delete pixel from flood area (it will appear as dark).
</UL>
Second and third buttons may be held down while moving the mouse to add or
delete a series of pixels.
<LI>The <B>Follow diagonals</B> checkbox:  when flooding an area, add pixels
that are touching pixels already in the area only on their corners.

<UL>
 <LI>Fill &ndash; Flood fill area at current point.
<LI>Clear &ndash; Clear a flooded area.
<LI>Build &ndash; Build contour(s) around flooded area.  (Hot key B in Zap
window.)
<LI>Next &ndash; Flood fill next section, starting at the center of gravity of
the last filled area.  If the insertion direction for contouring is reversed, 
it will go to the previous section.  (Hot key A in Zap window.)
