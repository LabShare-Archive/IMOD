<H2>Auto Contour</H2>
Auto contour creates closed contours that belong to the current object.  The
contours surround areas that  are either above or below a selected threshold.
<P>
To start using it, switch to High Contrast to see what areas fall above or below
threshold.  Adjust the threshold to the proper level to segment your features of
interest, switching back and forth between Regular and High contrast as needed.
Select the Alternate mouse to use the mouse buttons to control the filling
operation.  Then click on the interior of a desired area to flood that area in
red.  Adjust the area if necessary then press the Build button or the b hot key
to build a contour around the area.

<LI><B>Contrast</B>:  <B>Regular</B> contrast shows the image data, <B>High</B>
contrast shows the threshold level.
<LI>The <B>Threshold</B> slider controls the grey level that segments the data.
<LI>The <B>Resolution</B> slider controls point reduction in the generated contour.
Points are originally created at intervals of about 1 pixel.  Points are removed
if they are within this distance of a line segment between the remaining points.
<LI>The <B>Alternate mouse</B> checkbox allows the use of alternate mouse functions:"
	<UL><LI>First  - Select area by flooding around point.
	<LI>Second - Add pixel to flood area (it will appear as yellow).
	<LI>Third  - Delete pixel from flood area (it will appear as dark).
	</UL>
Second and third buttons may be held down while moving the mouse to add or
delete a series of pixels.
<LI>The <B>Follow diagonals</B> checkbox:  when flooding an area, add pixels
that are touching pixels already in the area only on their corners.
