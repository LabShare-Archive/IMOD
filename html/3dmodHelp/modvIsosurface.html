<A NAME = "TOP"><H3>Isosurface View Dialog</H3></A>
<P>
This dialog allows you to display isosurfaces of the input volume
or a subvolume of it.  An isosurface is a surface generated at places where
the intensity values cross a threshold value set by the user.
The subvolume is specified by a bounding box whose position and size
are set by sliders.  Isosurfaces are displayed when this dialog is
opened but will be removed when you close the dialog. 
<P>
The isosurface mesh and the bounding box are stored in two "extra objects".
Their display properties can be edited in the Model View Object Edit dialog.
The extra objects that can be edited are listed after the last regular object
in the model; just use the slider or spin box there to get to them.
<P>
If you click on a position in the isosurface with the right mouse button,
that position becomes the current point within 3dmod, thus allowing
you to find corresponding features in the image data.
<P>
The isosurfacing is always computed on a subvolume of byte values, even 
if data have been loaded into the program as 16-bit integers instead of bytes.
In the latter case, the scaling to bytes is determined by the
the <B>Low</B> and <B>High</B> sliders in
the <A HREF="infowin.html#TOP">Information window</A>.  In order to have good
dynamic range in the intensity values being analyzed,
be sure that the <B>Low</B> and <B>High</B> sliders are set so that images
have a good contrast with a
fairly wide range between the <B>Black</B> and <b>White</b> sliders.
Using the autocontrast function generally leaves the sliders in positions that
will allow good scaling for display.  Changing the <B>Low</B> and <B>High</B>
sliders will change the effect of the threshold setting here.
<P>
The computations will be done with multiple threads running in parallel if the
system has multiple processors.  Doing
so incurs some extra overhead and the computation time also does not reduce
proportional to the number of processors used and may even increase with more
than 4 threads on an 8-core system.  Thus, the maximum number of threads used
is 4, regardless of how many processors are available.  Up to 4, the number of
threads is set by the apparent number of processors on the system, or by
the value of the environment variable IMOD_PROCESSORS if it is set.
If your machine has hyperthreading enabled, the program will probably run
better if you avoid using hyperthreads by setting
IMOD_PROCESSORS to the actual number of cores on the system.
You can experiment with your system
by setting IMOD_PROCESSORS to various values and starting 3dmod with the
-DU option in order to see some time outputs.  Display a large portion of a
volume so that processing takes hundreds of milliseconds.
<P>
The isosurface display is based on contouring and surface smoothing
modules from Chimera, developed at the Resource for Biocomputing,
Visualization, and Informatics at UCSF.
<P>
The controls in
this window are in two columns.  The left side has controls for setting the threshold
and adjusting the volume being displayed; the right size presents a variety of
options. Controls are as follows:
</P>
<P>
At the top left is the <B>histogram</B> of voxel values inside the
bounding box.  The histogram is based on the byte values stored in
program memory, not the values in the image file.
<P>
The <B>Threshold</B> slider sets the constant intensity
value at which the isosurfaces will be rendered.  When you open this dialog,
the threshold is automatically set to a certain percentile on the low side of
the intensity distribution so as to show dark structures.  There is an option
in the Appearance tab of the 3dmod Preferences dialog to have the initial
threshold set on the high side so as to show light structures instead.
</P>
<P>
The <B>Outer limit</B> slider sets a second threshold beyond which intensity
values will be set to the median intensity, so that you can visualize just the
intensities between two values.  However, extreme intensities are usually
surrounded by less extreme ones; thus, if the program removed only the extreme
ones from consideration, you would usually see a shell around places with
extreme intensities.  To avoid this effect, the program searches up to 16 pixels
away from extreme pixels for ones that are above the threshold and sets those
to the median as well, as long as they are connected to an extreme one by a chain
of adjacent pixels above the threshold.  The outer limit is constrained to be
on the same side of the median intensity as the threshold.  No elimination is
done when the outer limit is at the end of the intensity range.
<P>
The <B>X</B>, <B>Y</B>, and <B>Z</B> sliders will track the
current point coordinate in 3dmod image display windows and can be
used to adjust the center position of the bounding box.  The bounding
box will center on the coordinate unless that would result in the box
size being smaller than the slider value. 
</P>
<P>
The <B>X size</B>, <B>Y size</B>, and <B>Z size</B> sliders can be
used to set the X, Y, and Z size of the bounding box.  The maximum
values of these sliders are set so as to prevent you from trying to
render too large a total volume, which is especially time-consuming when
the threshold is near the middle of the intensity distribution.  The maximum
number of voxels allowed, as well as the number of voxels when the display
first opens, can be controlled in the Appearance tab of the 3dmod
Preferences dialog.  The spin boxes there set the size of a cube equivalent to
whatever shape of volume is displayed.  Thus, display time will increase with
the cube of these numbers.
</P>
<P>
The <B>Zap Band</B> button can be used to set the size and
center of the bounding box in X and Y from the position of the rubber band in
the top Zap window.  The size will be limited to the maximum size
allowed for this display but the center position will be the same as that of
the rubber band.
<P>
The <B>Contour</B> button in the "Set X/Y area from" box allows you to set the 
size and center of the bounding box to fit the current contour when you
are masking the volume with the current contour (see
below).  When masking with the lasso in a Zap window, the button (now
labeled <B>Lasso</B>) will fit the bounding box to the lasso.  When masking
with the current object, the button (now labeled <B>Object</B>) will set the
X/Y area based on the extent of the current object over the selected Z range.
This button is useful for recentering if you change the current contour or
object or the center or size in Z.
<P>
<B>View isosurfaces</B> selects whether the isosurfaces will be
computed and displayed.
<P>
<B>View user model</B> selects whether the regular model is displayed
as well.
<P>
<B>View bounding box</B> selects whether a bounding box around the
data will be displayed.  When it is being displayed, it will also show
up in the Zap window regardless of what section is being displayed.
<P>
<B>Keep box centered</B> controls whether the dialog will center the
subvolume being rendered in the model view window whenever its size or
position changes.  The subvolume is also centered when this box is turned
on, so you can use it to center the volume even if you do not want to
leave it on.
<P>
<B>Link to global X, Y, Z</B> controls whether the coordinates selected in the
sliders on the left will be linked to the current point coordinate in 3dmod image
display windows.  If it is on, then changing these sliders will change the
current point in 3dmod and affect other displays; also, any change in current
point within 3dmod will change the center position of the bounding box.  If it
is off, then the coordinates selected here become independent of the current
point.  Turning the option off allows you to right-click on the isosurface
without having the isosurface display move to a new position.  It is also
useful when modeling scattered points directly in the Model View window in
order to paint the isosurface (see below).  Finally, if the button is off, a
masked isosurface will change dynamically as the masking contour, object, or
lasso or modified in a Zap window.
<P>
<B>Binning</B> selects the amount of binning of the data in 3D; e.g., with a
binning of 2, each voxel used for computing the isosurface will be the average
of 8 adjacent voxels.  Binning will both increase the speed of the display and
smooth the surface considerably.
<P>
<B>Smoothing</B> selects the number of iterations of a smoothing
routine that moves each vertex of the isosurface toward the average of
neighboring vertices.  Some of the change in appearance when you turn
on smoothing may reflect a change in the way the normals to the
surface are computed.  These normals control how light reflects from
the surface.  With no smoothing, they are computed from the image data
by the Chimera code, but with smoothing, they are recomputed from the triangles
in the usual way for IMOD meshes.  Note that another way to get a
smoother display is to restart 3dmod with the image loaded binned.
<P>
<B>Delete small pieces</B> can be turned on to eliminate small
pieces not connected to the rest of the surface.  The threshold size for
eliminating pieces can be adjusted with the <B>Min size</B> spin box, which
sets the minimum number of triangles required in order to retain a piece.
There is significant computation involved in identifying the small pieces, so
you may need to turn this option off while adjusting other features, then turn
it back on.
<P>
<B>Cap at box faces</B> can be turned on to close off
isosurfaces that go to the edge of the bounding box.  Otherwise, you will see
into the inside of any isosurface that is cut by the bounding box.
<P>
<B>Masking:</B> It is possible to restrict the region within the bounding box
that is rendered with one of the selections in the <B>Mask</B> box.
<UL>
<LI>Select <B>Current contour</B> to see isosurfaces just inside the current
  contour, provided the current object is closed type.  The same area will be
  shown for all planes in Z being displayed. When you first select the option,
  the bounding box size and center will be adjusted to just fit the contour if
  possible; if the contour is too large, the size will be restricted but the
  center will be set the same.  However, the subvolume will not be continually
  refit if you change contours or modify
  the current contour, unless the <B>Link to global X, Y, Z</B> button is
  turned off.  Press the <B>Contour</B> button in the "Set X/Y area" box to
  refit to a new or modified contour.
<LI>Select <B>Current object</B> to see isosurfaces inside of contours of the
  current object, provided it is closed type.  The Z size and center sliders
  control the range of data that will be displayed in Z.  You need not have a
  contour on each section in the range; the program can smoothly interpolate
  between the contours that you have drawn.  Specifically, for a section that
  has no contours, the program finds the nearest sections above and below in Z
  that have contours. If there is only one contour on each section, an
  interpolated contour is computed by forming a mesh between the two given
  contours and is used to constrain the isosurface on that section.  However,
  the interpolation is not possible if there is more than one contour on one
  of the sections, in which case it just uses the contour(s) on the nearest
  section.  Other than this limitation, there is no problem with having more
  than one contour on a section.  Just as described for <B>Current
  contour</B>, the bounding box will be set in X and Y to fit the object when the
  option is first selected, but if you change the current object, you need to
  push the <B>Object</B> button to refit the subvolume.
<LI>Select <B>Sphere</B> to see isosurfaces within the largest sphere that
  fits inside the bounding box.  The sphere will be centered on the position
  indicated by the X, Y, and Z sliders, unless the sphere would be truncated
  at that position.  Thus, if you make the bounding box large enough so that it
  does not change when you move one of these sliders, you can move the sphere
  around within a fixed subvolume.
<LI>Select <B>Ellipsoid</B> to see isosurfaces within an ellipsoid that
  touches all the faces of the bounding box.  Use the <B>X, Y, Z size</B> sliders
  to adjust the shape of the ellipsoid.
<LI>Select <B>Zap lasso</B> to see isosurfaces just inside the lasso in the
  top Zap window that has a lasso drawn.  This works the same as when <B>Current
  contour</B> is selected, except in one respect.  There are two ways of
  shifting the lasso in a Zap window: directly with the first or second mouse
  button when it is within 10 pixels of the lasso contour; or using the
  contour shifting/transforming enabled with the <B>Shift+P</B> hot key when no
  current contour is selected.  With the first way, the isosurface is updated
  only when the lasso movement is stopped (provided that <B>Link to global X,
  Y, Z</B> is turned off).  With the second way, the isosurface is updated as
  the lasso is shifted or transformed, just as when masking with the current
  contour.
</UL>
<P>
<B>Painting the Mesh:</B> It is possible to set different parts of the
isosurface to different colors or transparencies by enclosing them in the
spheres of a scattered point object.  To activate painting, turn on
the <B>Paint obj.</B> check box and select the object number in the spin box.
<UL>
<LI>All spheres must be in one object, so if you want more than one color, you
  need to use the <A HREF="finegrain.html#TOP">Fine Grain</A> dialog.  It is
  probably easiest to keep track of different colors by assigning colors to
  individual contours instead of points.  Select the <B>Contour</B> radio
  button at the top of the dialog and use the <B>Set</B> button in the "Line
  color" section to set the color of the current contour.
<LI>You can adjust sphere radius for individual points with
  the <A HREF="contourType.html#TOP">Surface/Contour/Point</A> dialog, with the mouse scroll
  wheel in the Zap window if <B>Set with mouse wheel</B> is checked in that
  dialog, or directly in the Model view window with the scroll wheel and Ctrl
  and Shift keys held down.
<LI>Spheres can overlap.  Use overlapping spheres of the same color to paint a
  non-spherical volume.  When two spheres of the different colors overlap,
  there will be a sharp boundary between the two colors.  If one sphere is
  contained entirely within another, then parts of the mesh inside the smaller
  sphere will be that sphere's color, and parts outside that sphere will be
  the larger sphere's color.  Thus, you can make concentric shells of
  different colors.
<LI>If the painting object is the current object, you can hold down Ctrl and
  Shift keys and do several modeling operations directly in the Model View
  window, aside from adjusting the size of the current point with the scroll
  wheel.  You can move the mouse with the left button held down to shift the
  current point in the X/Y plane of view.  Arrow keys and the PageUp
  and PageDown keys (not on the numeric keypad) can be used to shift in X/Y and in Z
  as well.  Click the middle button to insert a new point in the current
  contour.  Use the Delete key to delete the current point.  Click the right
  button to select a different scattered point; a point on the isosurface will
  not be picked as long as Ctrl and Shift are held down.
<LI>The "Subsets" panel of the  <A HREF="modvObjectEdit.html#Subsets">Edit Objects</A>
  dialog has an option to display only the current point; this may be useful
  for focusing on just one point at a time when working on the painting
  object.
<LI>Transparency can also applied with a painting object, although there may be
 limitations.  To erase a part of the mesh, the best way is to set
 transparency to 100 in the Edit Objects dialog for the object as a whole, or
 in the Fine Grain dialog for individual contours or points.  Rendering will
 be slower with transparency.  Artifacts often appear when two partially
 transparent items are superimposed.
</UL>
<P>
<B>Save to Object</B> is used to create two new objects containing copies of the
isosurfaces and the bounding box.  Until you do this, these items are
kept in "extra objects" that are not saved with the model.  This button is the
only way to save the isosurfaces in a model file and reload them.
When the bounding box is saved, it will stop being displayed on all
sections in the Zap window.  After you save the objects, the model
view window will show both the isosurfaces in the extra object and the
saved objects, unless you turn one or the other off.
