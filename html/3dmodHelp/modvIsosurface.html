<H3>Isosurface View Dialog</H3>
<P>
This dialog allows you to display isosurfaces of the input volume
or a subvolume of it.  An isosurface is a surface generated at places where
the intensity values cross a threshold value set by the user.
The subvolume is specified by a bounding box whose position and size
are set by sliders.  Isosurfaces are displayed when this dialog is
opened but will be removed when you close the dialog. 
<P>
The isosurface display is based on contouring and surface smoothing
modules from Chimera, developed at the Resource for Biocomputing,
Visualization, and Informatics at UCSF.
<P>
The controls in
this window are as follows:
</P>
<P>
<B>View isosurfaces</B> selects whether the isosurfaces will be
computed and displayed.
<P>
<B>View user model</B> selects whether the regular model is displayed
as well.
<P>
<B>View bounding box</B> selects whether a bounding box around the
data will be displayed.  When it is being displayed, it will also show
up in the Zap window regardless of what section is being displayed.
<P>
<B>Keep box centered</B> controls whether the dialog will center the
subvolume being rendered in the model view window whenever its size or
position changes.  The subvolume is also centered when this box is turned
on, so you can use it to center the volume even if you do not want to
leave it on.
<P>
<B>Smoothing</B> selects the number of iterations of a smoothing
routine that moves each vertex of the isosurface toward the average of
neighboring vertices.  Some of the change in appearance when you turn
on smoothing may reflect a change in the way the normals to the
surface are computed.  These normals control how light reflects from
the surface.  With no smoothing, they are computed from the image data
by the Chimera code, but with smoothing, they are recomputed from the triangles
in the usual way for IMOD meshes.  Note that another way to get a
smoother display is to restart 3dmod with the image loaded binned.
<P>
Below these controls is the <B>histogram</B> of voxel values inside the
bounding box.  The histogram is based on the byte values stored in
program memory, not the values in the image file.
<P>
<B>Threshold</B> sets the constant intensity
value at which the isosurfaces will be rendered.</P>
<P>
The <B>X</B>, <B>Y</B>, and <B>Z</B> sliders will track the
current point coordinate in 3dmod image display windows and can be
used to adjust the center position of the bounding box.  The bounding
box will center on the coordinate unless that would result in the box
size being smaller than the slider value. 
</P>
<P>
The <B>X size</B>, <B>Y size</B>, and <B>Z size</B> sliders can be
used to set the X, Y, and Z size of the bounding box.  The maximum
values of these sliders are set so as to prevent you from trying to
render too large a total volume, which is especially time-consuming when
the threshold is near the middle of the intensity distribution.
</P>
<P>
<B>Save</B> is used to create two new objects containing copies of the
isosurfaces and the bounding box.  Until you do this, these items are
kept in "extra objects" whose properties cannot (yet) be edited in the
Edit-Objects window.  For now, saving the objects is the only way to
adjust their color and other display properties.  Also, this is the
only way to save the isosurfaces in a model file and reload them.
When the bounding box is saved, it will stop being displayed on all
sections in the Zap window.  After you save the objects, the model
view window will show both the isosurfaces in the extra object and the
saved objects, unless you turn one or the other off.
