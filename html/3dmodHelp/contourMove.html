<H3>Contour Moving</H3>

This dialog is used to move contours to a different object or to a 
different surface, or to toggle adjusting the size or position of
a contour with the mouse. 
Use the spin box to select the object or surface # to move 
the current contour to.  
3dmod remembers the object #, so the hot key 'M' in the 
Zap window can be used to move contours quickly.
<P>
Ordinarily, a single contour will be moved, the current contour.  
If you have selected multiple contours using Ctrl and the 
first mouse button, all selected contours in the current object 
will be moved to the other 
object or surface, unless you have checked the option to 
move all contours in a surface.
<P>
When <B>Move all contours with same surface #</B> is selected, all 
contours with the same surface number as the current contour will 
also be moved to the selected object or surface.  If no surfaces have 
been assigned in the current object, then all contours in the object 
will be moved.  If contours are being moved to another object, they will be
assigned a new surface number that is different from the existing surfaces in
the other object. 
<P>
When <B>Move contour to different surface, not object</B> is selected, 
contours are assigned to a different surface in the same object 
rather than moved to a new object.
<P>
<B>Replace contour by single point of same size</B> can be 
used when the type of the selected target object is scattered 
points and the current object is not scattered points.  
Moving a contour will convert the current 
contour into a single point centered on the contour and with 
a size that corresponds to the area of the contour.  The new 
point will be added to the end of the last contour in the 
target object.  The 
current contour will be deleted.
<P>
<B>Replace spherical point with circular contours</B> can be 
used when the type of the current object is scattered points and the 
selected target object is not scattered points.  
Moving will convert just the current point to a set of circular 
contours, one on each of the sections where the sphere of the current 
point appears.  The radius of the contours, and the range in Z over 
which they appear, will thus depend on the model's Z-scale, just as 
the appearance of a spherical point does.  The current point will be 
deleted.  The contours will be given a unique surface number in the 
target object so that they can be manipulated together or deleted 
easily.
<P>
When the current object consists of scattered points, the 
<B>Preserve sizes of points with default size</B> button can be used to 
specify whether the sizes of 
the points will be completely preserved when they are 
transferred to the new object.  If the button is selected, 
points that do not have their own individual sizes will be 
assigned the default size of the current object before being 
moved to the new object.  If the button is not depressed, 
such points will not be assigned individual sizes, and they 
will acquire the default size of the object they are moved 
to.  In either case, points that do have individual sizes 
will retain these sizes after the transfer.
<P>
When moving contours to a different object, the surface 
number that they have in their new home depends on whether 
the first toggle button is selected.  If it is not (i.e., 
you are moving one contour at a time), then each 
contour moved will have the same surface number as before, 
and no surfaces will be created if there are none already. 
If the button is selected (i.e., you are moving all contours 
with the same surface number), then the set of contours that 
get moved in one operation will be assigned to a new surface 
with the next free number in the new object.  If you want to 
move all of the contours in an object with no surfaces into 
a different object and have them occupy a separate surface 
in that object, select the option to move all contours with 
the same surface number.
<P>
<B>Move contour one section</B> can be selected to shift contours up or 
down in Z, provided that other kinds of movements are not selected.  
If <B>Move all contours with same surface #</B> is selected, then all 
contours in the surface will be moved.  Otherwise, all selected 
contours will be moved if there is more than one.  Unlike other move
operations, if contours are selected from more than one object, they will
all be moved.
The current point and selected contours remain unchanged 
so it is easy to repeat this operation.
<P>
<B>Toggle adjusting contour with mouse</B> 
toggles a mode in which you can shift, rotate, stretch, or scale
the whole current contour by dragging with a mouse button held down.  
The first mouse button is used to shift; the second button is used to rotate;
the third is used to stretch the contour along an axis, or to scale it
uniformly if the Shift key is held down.  If mouse buttons have their default
mappings, 
these functions are the same as in the
<A HREF = "../man/midas.html">Midas</A> program.
If multiple contours are selected, the same operation will be done on all of
them.  This mode stays active until toggled off again. 
To shift contour(s), position the mouse anywhere, press the first mouse 
button, and shift the contour(s) to the desired position.  
To rotate, press the second button and move the mouse in an arc around the 
center of mass of the selected contour(s); to stretch or scale, press the 
third button and move the mouse toward or away from this center point.
During these actions, the center of rotation/stretching will be marked with 
a star.
You can set this center by clicking with Ctrl and the second mouse button.
These operations work for any contours in closed contour objects and for
coplanar contours in open contour objects.
