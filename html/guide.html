    <h3>Installation</h3>
    </a> </dt>
All of the IMOD programs are available via the <a
 href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/download.html">IMOD Download Page</a>.
&nbsp;The distribution is bundled together using the Unix tar program
with gzip compression, then placed in a file after a C shell script
that can extract and install the programs.&nbsp;If you are willing to
install to the default location in the system and set up the IMOD
environment for all users in the default way, then you can install
simply by running this
script, e.g.,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>csh imod_3.7.2_FC2.csh</code><br>
  <br>
(In this guide, the specific filenames are used as an example; your
copy may have higher version numbers.)&nbsp;Moreover, if you have
followed our recommended installation procedures
since IMOD 3.0.8, you should be able to upgrade using the same
command. If you want to install to a location other than the default,
on all systems except Windows, you can specify the desired location,
e.g.,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>csh imod_3.7.2_FC2.csh -dir /opt</code><br>
  <br>
Note that older versions will be renamed but not automatically
removed by the installation procedure.&nbsp;If you need to work with
the tar file instead, you can
just extract it with:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>imod_3.7.2_FC2.csh -extract<br>
  </code><br>
The sections below on individual machine types describe what will be
done by the default installation procedure and list the steps for
doing a manual installation instead of using the self-installing
package.<br>

    <h4><a name="SettingUpLinux">Setting Up a Linux PC to Run IMOD.</a></h4>
    <a name="SettingUpLinux"> </a> The recommended configuration for
running the IMOD software is:
    <p> Processor: Intel Pentium 4 or M or AMD Athlon or Opteron<br>
Video Card: any relatively modern Nvidia card (GeForce or Quadro, 64 MB
or 128 MB cards preferred)<br>
Minimum memory size: 512MB <br>
Minimum disk size: 15 GB <br>
Operating System: Red Hat Workstation 3 or Fedora 2 or higher<br>
Nvidia Linux device drivers and OpenGL libraries from <a
 href="http://www.nvidia.com">Nvidia</a>, at least version 4496 or
higher. <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Nvidia installation.</b> Installing Nvidia
drivers is now fairly straightforward, but here are some <a
 href="nvidia_install.txt">instructions</a> that may be helpful. The
critical step not taken care of by the driver installation is to change
the Driver line in /etc/X11/XF86Config from "nv" to "nvidia".&nbsp; In
addition, here is a sample of a <a href="xorg.conf-FC.txt">/etc/X11/xorg.conf</a>
file from Fedora Core 4, set up to use an old 24-inch Sony monitor.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dd>
    <p><b>Compatibility packages for Fedora Core 4.</b> One or two
packages not in the default installation are needed to run IMOD under
a fresh installation of FC4.&nbsp; If you are running a version of IMOD built 
under FC4, you
need compat-libf2c-32, available here for <a
 href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/FC4/compat-libf2c-32-3.2.3-47.fc4.i386.rpm">i386</a>
or&nbsp;<a
 href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/FC4/compat-libf2c-32-3.2.3-47.fc4.x86_64.rpm">x86_64</a>
.&nbsp; The reason for this is that the Fortran compiler g77 has been
declared "legacy" even though its successor, gfortran, is too buggy to
rely on yet.&nbsp; If you are running an IMOD built under FC2, you also
need compat-libstdc++-33, available here for <a
 href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/FC4/compat-libstdc++-33-3.2.3-47.fc4.i386.rpm">i386</a>
or&nbsp;<a
 href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/FC4/compat-libstdc++-33-3.2.3-47.fc4.x86_64.rpm">x86_64</a>
. </p>
    <p><b>Window manager settings.</b> To keep 3dmod from
bogging down when it is displaying complex models, the window manager
should be set to display only the outline and not the contents of
windows when they are moved or resized.&nbsp; This cannot be done under
Gnome but it can under KDE, by opening up the
Control Center and selecting "Look and Feel" or "Desktop" (depending on
KDE version), then "Window Behavior" then the "Moving" panel. </p>
    <a name="InstallingLinuxSGI">
    <h4>Installing IMOD on a Linux PC or an SGI</h4>
    </a>
    <p> The self-installing package will install to <code>/usr/local/IMOD</code>
unless given an alternate location with the <code>-dir</code>
option.&nbsp;
Under Linux, it will copy <code>IMOD-linux.sh </code>and <code>IMOD-linux.csh
    </code>to <code>/etc/profile.d</code>.&nbsp; On an SGI, it will
place an appropriate "source" command into <code>/etc/cshrc</code> if
it is not there already, but it will not modify <code>/etc/profile</code>
for bash users (see step 9B below to do this.)&nbsp; To accomplish all
of this, change directory to the place where the package is located and
enter, for example:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>sudo csh </code><code>imod_3.7.2_FC2.csh</code><br>
    <br>
You will have to open a new window, or possibly even log out and
log back in, for the installation to take effect.<br>
    </p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dd>If you are upgrading IMOD using the default procedures, and your
previous installation used another method for setting the environment
variables for users, be sure to remove whatever commands were used
before. &nbsp;These might have been placed in <code>/etc/cshrc</code>,<code>
/usr/local/etc/cshrc</code>,
or users' <code>.cshrc</code>, <code>.bashrc</code>, or <code>.profile</code>
files. &nbsp;The advantage of the current procedure is that future
upgrades
will be easier, especially if the startup files change.</dd>
  <dd><br>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dd>
    <p>To install manually from the tar file, do the following steps:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li> Log in as root or do all of these commands with sudo </li>
      <li> cd to the directory where you downloaded IMOD, and <br>
        <code> mv imod_3.7.2_FC2.tar.gz /usr/local</code> </li>
      <li><code> cd /usr/local</code> </li>
      <li><code> gunzip imod_3.7.2_FC2.tar.gz</code> </li>
      <li><code> tar xvf imod_3.7.2_FC2.tar</code> </li>
      <li>To see if you already have a /usr/local/IMOD, <br>
        <code> ls -l</code> </li>
      <li>If you do have a /usr/local/IMOD and it is a link (e.g., it
shows up as <code> IMOD -&gt; imod_2.7.6</code>), then enter <br>
        <code> rm IMOD</code> <br>
Otherwise, rename the existing directory, e.g.: <br>
        <code> mv IMOD oldIMOD</code> </li>
      <li><code> ln -s imod_3.7.2 IMOD</code> </li>
      <li> (A) Under Linux, enter <br>
        <code> cp IMOD/IMOD-linux.* /etc/profile.d</code> <br>
(B) On an SGI, insert the text in <code>IMOD/sgi.cshrc</code> into <code>/etc/cshrc</code>,
specifically the command <br>
        <code>if (-e /usr/local/IMOD/IMOD-sgi.csh) source
/usr/local/IMOD/IMOD-sgi.csh </code><br>
If there are any bash users, also insert the text in <code>IMOD/sgi.bashrc</code>
into <code>/etc/profile</code>,
specifically the command <br>
        <code>[ -r /usr/local/IMOD/IMOD-sgi.sh ] &amp;&amp; source
/usr/local/IMOD/IMOD-sgi.sh</code><br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dd>If you do not want a system wide installation, instead of step 9
above, then under Linux, place the following in the <code>.cshrc</code>
files of individual users of <code>tcsh</code> (where &lt;location of
IMOD&gt; is the absolute path to the IMOD directory):</dd>
  <dd><code>setenv IMOD_DIR &lt;location of IMOD&gt;</code></dd>
  <dd><code>if (-e $IMOD_DIR/IMOD-linux.csh) source
$IMOD_DIR/IMOD-linux.csh </code></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dd>or, place the following in the <code>.bashrc</code> of
individual
users under <code>bash</code>:</dd>
  <dd><code>export IMOD_DIR=&lt;location of IMOD&gt;</code></dd>
  <dd><code>if [ -e $IMOD_DIR/IMOD-linux.sh ] ; then source
$IMOD_DIR/IMOD-linux.sh ; fi</code></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dd>or, on an SGI, place the following in the <code>.cshrc</code>
files of individual users:</dd>
  <dd><code>setenv IMOD_DIR &lt;location of IMOD&gt;</code></dd>
  <dd><code>if (-e $IMOD_DIR/IMOD-sgi.csh) source $IMOD_DIR/IMOD-sgi.csh</code></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dd>Finally, if you just want to try running the programs in a
particular copy of IMOD, cd to the top IMOD directory and, on Linux
under <code>tcsh</code>, enter:</dd>
  <dd> <code>setenv IMOD_DIR `pwd`</code></dd>
  <dd><code>source IMOD-linux.csh </code></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dd>and similarly on the SGI, sourcing <code>IMOD-sgi.csh</code>. On
Linux under <code>bash</code>, enter:</dd>
  <dd><code>export IMOD_DIR=`pwd`</code></dd>
  <dd><code>source IMOD-linux.sh<br>
    <br>
    </code>Under Linux, <code>3dmod</code> may fail to run if another
installed package has placed an incompatible Qt or OpenGL library on
your library load path.&nbsp; The sign of a problem with the Qt library
is an error message about an undefined symbol, usually a very long
string containing "QGLWidget".&nbsp; In addition, communication between
    <code>3dmod</code> and <code>eTomo</code> may fail with some
versions of Qt.&nbsp; The remedy for these problems depends on whether
your IMOD&nbsp; distribution has a Qt library included.&nbsp; <br>
  </dd>
</dl>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>If the distribution has a Qt library, you will find <code>IMOD-localQt.sh</code>
and <code>IMOD-localQt.csh</code> in the top IMOD directory.&nbsp; Use
these to replace the startup files in <code>/etc/profile.d</code>:<br>
      <code>sudo cp IMOD-localQt.sh /etc/profile.d/IMOD-linux.sh<br>
      </code><code>sudo cp IMOD-localQt.csh
/etc/profile.d/IMOD-linux.csh</code><br>
    </li>
    <li>&nbsp;If your distribution does not have a Qt library, the top
IMOD directory contains
two
files, <code>IMOD-qtconflict.sh</code> and <code>IMOD-qtconflict.csh</code>,
that can be used to solve the problem. &nbsp;Try sourcing the
appropriate file, then try following the directions in the file and
sourcing it again. &nbsp;If this solves the problem, make any needed
changes to both files and copy them to <code>/etc/profile.d,</code>
without deleting <code>IMOD-linux.*sh</code>.<code><br>
      </code></li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Installing Java on Linux PC or SGI</h4>
  </a>Etomo is a Java 2 application and thus requires a Java runtime
environment (JRE) with a version of 1.4 or better to be
installed.&nbsp; Etomo will not work with the GNU Java that is
currently distributed with Fedora Core, so you will need a Sun
version.&nbsp; If you are installing for the first time you might as
well install version 1.5 since IMOD may eventually require that.&nbsp;
Sun's JRE version 1.5.0_6
is
available <a
 href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/java/jre-1_5_0_06-linux-i586.bin">here</a>&nbsp;for
Linux. <br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-family: monospace;"><code></code></span>To
install the JRE for Linux first move the <code><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">jre-1_5_0_06-linux-i586.bin</span></code>file
to <code>/usr/local</code>
  <p class="western"><code><span style="font-family: monospace;">mv </span></code><span
 style="font-family: monospace;"><code><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">jre-1_5_0_06-linux-i586.bin /usr/local</span></code><br>
  </span></p>
  <p class="western">Next change your working directory to <code>/usr/local</code>
and&nbsp; execute the bin by entering</p>
  <p class="western"><span style="font-family: monospace;"><code>cd
/usr/local</code><br>
  </span></p>
  <p class="western"><span style="font-family: monospace;"><code>sh
jre-1_5_0_06-linux-i586.bin</code><br>
  </span></p>
  <p class="western">on the command line. &nbsp;</p>
  <p class="western">This will install the JRE in <code>/usr/local/jre1.5.0_06</code>.
&nbsp;The IMOD startup scripts assume that the JRE is in <code>/usr/local/java</code>,
so next create a link: </p>
  <p class="western"><span style="font-family: monospace;"><code>ln
-s jre1.5.0_06 java</code><br>
  </span></p>
  <span style="font-family: monospace;"><code></code></span>
  <p class="western">If you upgrade to a different JRE, then you just
need to change the link. &nbsp;If you wish to use a different JRE than
the one pointed to by <code>/usr/local/java</code>, you must edit the <code>IMOD-linux.sh</code>
and <code>IMOD-linux.csh</code> scripts in <code>/etc/profile.d</code>
and define the variable IMOD_JAVADIR to specify the directory where the
JRE you wish to use is installed.<br>
  </p>
For an SGI, we recommend using version 1.4.0 of the Java runtime
environment, available <a
 href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/java/SGI-Java2v14-EA-eoe.tardist">here</a>.
&nbsp;If it loses its extension in the download, make sure it ends in
"tardist". For example, <br>
  <code><br>
mv SGI-Java-2v14-EA-eoe.tar SGI-Java-2v14-EA-eoe.tardist</code><br>
  <br>
Then install it with <br>
  <br>
  <code>swmgr -f &nbsp;SGI-Java-2v14-EA-eoe.tardi</code>st &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
  <a name="InstallingMac">
  <h4>Installing IMOD on a Macintosh running OS X</h4>
  </a>The self-installing package will install to /Applications or to
an alternate location with the <code>-dir</code> option.&nbsp; It will
place appropriate "source" commands for defining the user environment
in <code>/etc/csh.login<span style="font-family: sans-serif;"> </span></code>and
  <code>/etc/profile</code>.&nbsp;You
need to be able to use sudo. &nbsp;Open a terminal window, change
directory to the place where the package is located, and enter, e.g.:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>sudo csh imod_3.7.2_osx.csh</code><br>
  <br>
You will need to exit and restart Terminal for these changes to take
effect, or you can just source <code>/etc/csh.login</code>&nbsp;(if
you
are
running tcsh) or <code>/etc/profile</code>&nbsp;(if you are running
bash).
If you are upgrading IMOD with the
default installation
procedures and your previous installation used another method of
setting environment variables, then you may need to remove "source" or
other environment-setting commands from various files, such as <code>/etc/csh.login</code>,
  <code>/etc/profile</code>, or users' <code>.cshrc</code>, <code>.bashrc</code>,
or <code>.profile</code>&nbsp;files.<br>
  <br>
Once you have verified that IMOD programs run after
installing them, you can make some links in <code>/usr/lib</code> to
libraries
in the IMOD directories that will allow you to start 3dmod by clicking
on its icon. &nbsp;Run the <code>linklibs-mac </code>script by
entering:<br>
  <code>&nbsp;&nbsp; sudo $IMOD_DIR/linklibs-mac -i</code><br>
If this creates problems, such as conflicts with other programs that
supply their own Qt libraries, you can remove the links with:<br>
  <code>&nbsp;&nbsp; sudo $IMOD_DIR/linklibs-mac -u<br>
  </code>If you are upgrading IMOD and have done this before, you
should run <code>$IMOD_DIR/linklibs-mac -u </code>before installing
the new version.<br>
  <br>
To install manually from the tar file, you have two
alternatives.&nbsp;To do it from the command line, open a Terminal
window and:<br>
  <ol>
    <li> cd to the directory where you downloaded IMOD, and <br>
      <code>sudo mv imod_3.7.2_osx.tar.gz /Applications</code></li>
    <li><code>cd /Applications</code></li>
    <li><code>sudo tar xvzf imod_3.7.2_osx.0.tar</code></li>
    <li>To see if you already have a /Applications/IMOD, <br>
      <code> ls -l</code> </li>
    <li>If you do have a /Applications/IMOD and it is a link (e.g., it
shows up as <code> IMOD -&gt; imod_3.1.6</code>), then enter <br>
      <code>sudo rm IMOD</code> <br>
Otherwise, rename the existing directory, e.g.: <br>
      <code>sudo mv IMOD oldIMOD</code> </li>
    <li><code> sudo mv imod_3.7.2 IMOD</code></li>
  </ol>
  <br>
If you are on a single user-machine or have administrative privileges
from the desktop, you can use the following alternative approach:
  <ol>
    <li>Click on the downloaded file to unpack it with Stuffit Expander
and create the IMOD folder, e.g. <code>imod_3.7.2</code></li>
    <li>Drag this folder into the /Applications folder.</li>
    <li>If you already have an IMOD folder in /Applications, rename it
or move it elsewhere.</li>
    <li>Rename the new distribution to IMOD.</li>
  </ol>
  <br>
Whichever approach you use, you need to add some startup commands to
the system files <code>/etc/csh.login </code>and <code>/etc/profile</code>,
unless they are already there from a previous installation of
IMOD.&nbsp;Use sudo to invoke <code>emacs </code>or <code>pico</code>&nbsp;on
these files.&nbsp;Copy the text in <code>IMOD/mac.cshrc</code>&nbsp;to
the
end of <code>/etc/csh.login</code>, specifically the command <br>
  <code>if (-e /Applications/IMOD/IMOD-mac.csh) source
/Applications/IMOD/IMOD-mac.csh<br>
  <br>
  </code>Similarly, copy the text in <code>IMOD/mac.bashrc</code>&nbsp;to
the end of <code>/etc/profile</code>, specifically the command <br>
  <code>[ -r /Applications/IMOD/IMOD-mac.sh ] &amp;&amp; source
/Applications/IMOD/IMOD-mac.sh</code><br>
  <br>
If you want to install at another location, change <code>/Applications/IMOD</code>&nbsp;to
the name of the top IMOD directory in <code>IMOD-mac.csh<span
 style="font-family: sans-serif;"> </span></code>and <code>IMOD-mac.sh<span
 style="font-family: sans-serif;"> </span></code>and
in the source commands placed in <code>/etc/csh.login </code>and<code>
/etc/profile.<br>
  </code><br>
See the above instructions for Linux PC and SGI for other variations on
installation procedures.<br>
  <br>
  <a name="SettingUpWindows"> </a>
  <h4><a name="SettingUpWindows">Setting Up a Windows PC to Run IMOD</a></h4>
  <a name="SettingUpWindows"> </a>For complete IMOD functionality
under Windows, including the ability to run
shell scripts and to build tomograms, you need to install a Unix-like
environment called <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>.
&nbsp;We have provided a <a
 href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/windows/cygwinForIMOD0106.exe">Cygwin
package</a> (from January, 2006) to make this process simpler and more
predictable.
&nbsp;This installation will occupy ~75 MB, all located under a single
directory that can be removed easily. &nbsp;The installation will also
create icons on the desktop and in the Start Menu, and make several
simple entries to the Windows registry.<br>
  <br>
This package includes a superior
terminal window called <code>rxvt</code>&nbsp;and a lightweight text
editor, <code>nano</code>&nbsp;(derived from <code>pico</code>&nbsp;and
similar
to the editor in the <code>pine</code>&nbsp;email program).&nbsp;You
can
upgrade a previous Cygwin installation using this package, using the
same procedure as described below.<br>
  <br>
Cygwin installation may work best if you are logged in as a user with
Administrative privileges.<br>
  <br>
To install or upgrade Cygwin from the package in <code>cygwinForIMOD.exe</code>:<br>
  <br>
  <ol>
    <li>Click on the package to extract it. Press "Browse" and select
a folder to unzip to that is conveniently accessed (the Desktop will
do). &nbsp;You will get the <code>setup.exe</code> program and a <code>cygwinMaster</code>&nbsp;
folder with all the packages.</li>
    <li>Click on <code>setup.exe</code></li>
    <li>Select install from a Local Directory</li>
    <li>Set the root drive to <code>C:\cygwin</code> unless you want
it
on a different disk. Do not install under a directory with spaces in
its name. In the rest of this document, C:\ is used in the examples,
and you need to substitute your location if it is different.<br>
Take the defaults for the other two selections: install for all users
and Unix line endings.</li>
    <li>Select the <code>cygwinMaster</code> folder as the Local
Package Directory</li>
    <li>On the Select Packages page, click on the circular double arrow
next to "All" to switch from "Default" to "Install"</li>
    <li>Proceed with the installation, and take the defaults to create
icons on the desktop and start menu.</li>
  </ol>
  <br>
The installation will create a Unix-like directory tree under <code>C:\cygwin</code>.&nbsp;Terminal
windows and Cygwin programs such as the Unix tools will
display and work with paths that are relative to the Cygwin
installation.&nbsp;For example, if you have installed Cygwin in <code>C:\cygwin</code>&nbsp;
then the <code>/usr/local/IMOD</code>&nbsp;directory will exist in the
windows file systems as <code>C:\cygwin\usr\local\IMOD</code>.<br>
  <br>
After installation you will get an icon that
will
start up a shell under bash.&nbsp;The first time that you run this, a
home directory is created in&nbsp;<code>/home</code>&nbsp;(<code>C:\cygwin\home</code>)
and some bash
startup files are copied there.<br>
  <br>
The primary advantage of the <code>rxvt<span
 style="font-family: sans-serif;"> </span></code>window is that you
can
copy and paste just like under Unix (highlight with left mouse button,
paste with middle mouse button). This capability uses the Windows
clipboard, so you can copy text in a Windows program (Ctrl-C) and paste
with the mouse in the <code>rxvt </code>window, or highlight in the <code>rxvt
  </code>window
and paste in a Windows program with Ctrl-V.&nbsp;Another
advantage is that you can resize the <code>rxvt</code>&nbsp;window
horizontally as well as vertically.&nbsp;The <code>cygwinMaster </code>folder
contains two shortcuts and a configuration file that make it
easy to use <code>rxvt.</code>&nbsp;To use rxvt:<br>
  <ol>

  <h4>Installing IMOD on a Windows PC</h4>
  </a>The self-installing package will install IMOD in /usr/local and
copy <code>IMOD-cygwin.sh</code>&nbsp;and <code>IMOD-cygwin.csh</code>&nbsp;to
  <code>/etc/profile.d</code>. It will not work by clicking on it, only
by executing it as from the command line.&nbsp; To
install IMOD, start a Cygwin terminal window, change to the
directory where the package is located, and enter, e.g.:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>csh imod_3.7.2_win.csh<br>
  </code><br>
  <ol>
  </ol>
You will have to open a new Cygwin window for the installation to take
effect. <br>
  <br>
After installation, everything can be run from a Cygwin
window. &nbsp;In order to run eTomo, you also need to have Java
installed and
define some environment variables inside Windows:<br>
  <br>
  <ol>
    <li>If you do not already have Java (many machines do now), get the
latest Java Run-time Environment from <a href="http://www.sun.com">Sun</a>
or use the version provided <a
 href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/java/jre-1_5_0_06-windows-i586-p.exe">here</a>
.</li>
    <li> Click on the file and take the defaults to install Java. When
you are done, you can delete any Java icons from your desktop.</li>
    <li> To define environment variables, right click My Computer,
select Properties, Advanced, Environment Variables. Define all of these
paths in Windows format. Press "New" to define a variable.</li>
    <li>Under "System variables", define &nbsp;<code>IMOD_DIR</code>
&nbsp;to be &nbsp;<code>C:\cygwin\usr\local\IMOD</code></li>
    <li>Under "User variables for username", define <code>&nbsp;HOME</code>
&nbsp; to be &nbsp; <code>C:\cygwin\home\username</code></li>
    <li> You also need to add the Cygwin bin to the system path, e.g.,
under "System variables", select <code>PATH</code>, press "Edit", and
add <code>C:\cygwin\bin; </code>to the front of the path (the ";" is
a
separator).</li>
  </ol>
  <br>
Here are some optional steps:<br>
  <br>
If you installed to a drive other than C:, you should define&nbsp; <code>IMOD_DIR</code>
as an environment variable in Windows as described above, but with the
appropriate letter instead of C, so that <code>3dmod</code> will be
able to find help files if it is started by clicking on an icon.<br>
  <br>
You can add <code>C:\cygwin\usr\local\IMOD\bin</code>&nbsp;to the
Windows
path, in which case you will be able to run everything but shell
scripts
from a DOS window.<br>
  <br>
To get some command files with DOS line endings you can define an
environment variable <code>CYGWIN</code>&nbsp;to be&nbsp;<code>nobinmode</code>.
This will make command files from <code>Setupcombine</code>, but not
those from <code>Copytomocoms</code>, have DOS line endings. If there
is demand for this, <code>Copytomocoms</code>&nbsp;will be changed to
produce
DOS line endings too.<br>
  <br>
If you want to be able to display and print Postscript graphs from the
Fortran graphics programs (e.g., <code>nda, mtk, mtoverlap</code>),
you
can install <a
 href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/windows/gs811w32.exe">ghostscript</a>&nbsp;and
  <a href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/windows/gsv45w32.exe">gsview</a>&nbsp;for
Windows.<br>
  <br>
The steps for manually installing from the tar file
instead are:<br>
  <ol>
    <li> Start a Cygwin terminal window. <br>
    </li>
    <li> Move your copy of the IMOD distribution to <code>/usr/local</code>
either from the command line or from an Explorer window, where the
location will appear as <code>C:\cygwin\usr\local</code>.</li>
    <li>Change directory to <code>/usr/local</code> and, if you have
an existing IMOD installed, rename it.<br>
      <code>cd /usr/local<br>
mv IMOD oldIMOD</code><br>
    </li>
    <li>&nbsp;Unpack the tar file, rename it to IMOD, and copy startup
files: <br>
      <code></code><code>tar -xzf imod_3.7.2.tar.gz </code><br>
      <code>mv imod_3.7.2 IMOD </code><br>
      <code>cp IMOD/IMOD-cygwin.* /etc/profile.d</code></li>
  </ol>
  <br>
Finally, if you do not want to install Cygwin, you can still
use most of the programs in
IMOD.&nbsp;In this case, get the <code>.tar.gz</code>&nbsp;distribution
instead of the self-installing distribution and use <a
 href="http://www.winzip.com">Winzip </a>to
unpack it somewhere, (e.g., <code>C:\Program Files</code>), rename the
top directory to IMOD, and add the IMOD\bin directory (e.g., C:\Program
Files\IMOD\bin) to your path in Windows, as described above.&nbsp;<code>&nbsp;</code><a
 name="TIFFLibrary">
  <h4>TIFF Library Support</h4>
  </a>The 3dmod program is able to read TIFF files on the PC or
Mac,
and will be able to read them on an SGI if the library <code>libtiff.so</code>&nbsp;is
available. Versions compiled for IRIX 6.5 assume that the
library is available.
  <p> If you are trying to run a version that is compiled for the
library but the library is not on your system, <code>3dmod</code> and
several other programs will not run until you rename a dummy library, <code>nolibtiff.so</code>,
to <code>libtiff.so</code>. From the top IMOD directory, do the
following: </p>
  <pre>cd lib<br>mv nolibtiff.so libtiff.so<br></pre>
and, on the SGI only, continue with:
  <pre>cd ../lib32<br>mv nolibtiff.so libtiff.so<br></pre>
  <p> Conversely, if you have a version that does not assume the
library and you do have the library (whose source you can obtain from <a
 href="ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff">SGI</a>), then to use the
library, you need to remove or rename the dummy <code>libtiff.so</code>
in the <code>IMOD/lib</code> directory. </p>
  <a name="FastBackprojection">
  <h4>Fast Backprojection Support</h4>
  </a>The Tilt program now contains a fast backprojection
algorithm
developed by Gregory Beylkin and Kristian Sandberg at the University of
Colorado. This method produces reconstructions 1.5-2.5 times faster,
depending on the computer architecture and the size of the slice being
reconstructed (the larger, the better). It works when there is tilt
around the X-axis but not with local alignments. Unfortunately, the
advantage is very small on Pentium 4 machines with our current
distribution, compiled with gnu compilers. To take advantage of the
algorithm, you need a license to use the USFFT library, which is
commercial software for doing unequally spaced FFTs. A license is free
for non-profit organizations, but the licensing mechanism currently
works only for 32-bit Linux. To obtain a license, contact <a
 href="mailto:mast@colorado.edu"> David Mastronarde </a>with a request
and a description of your institution. Once you have the license, you
need to set the environment variable USFFT2_LICENSE_FILE to point to
the license file. This is already done in the startup files supplied
with IMOD. The program will use standard backprojection if there is
no license.

  <h3>Getting Started</h3>

<dt>You will want to go through the <a href="3dmodguide.html">Introduction
to 3dmod</a> because <code>3dmod</code> is the central graphical tool
of
the IMOD package. Beyond this, your initial problem may be getting
data into a format usable by the IMOD programs. If you are having
problems getting your data into a format usable by IMOD contact us for
help. </dt>
<dl>
  <dd>
    <h4>The Image Data Format and File Conversion</h4>
All of the IMOD programs use the <a href="mrc_format.txt">MRC image
file format</a>. We have utility programs available for converting TIFF
files, SGI rgb files and raw data into the MRC file format.
    <p> Use the program <a href="man/tif2mrc.html">tif2mrc</a> to
convert a series of TIFF image files into a single MRC image file. The <code>tif2mrc</code>
program has an option for converting 24-bit color to 8-bit grayscale
images, and options for dealing with unsigned 16 bit images, which are
a
potential problem because the MRC format supports only signed 16-bit
images. The following example will create a MRC file from a list of
TIFF files (cell01.tif, cell02.tif ...). </p>
    <p><code> tif2mrc cell??.tif cell.mrc </code> </p>
    <p>See the <a href="man/tif2mrc.html">tif2mrc manual page</a>
for
more information on how to use <code>tif2mrc</code>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dd>If you already have a series of MRC files, with one image per
file, you can combine them into a single stack easily with the program
&nbsp;<a href="man/newstack.html">newstack</a>.&nbsp; For example, enter</dd>
  <dd><br>
  </dd>
  <dd><code>newstack cell*.mrc cell.st&nbsp;</code></dd>
  <dd><br>
  </dd>
  <dd>The program <a href="man/raw2mrc.html">raw2mrc</a> is used to
convert raw image data into the mrc format. This program can take a
file of 8 or 16 bit integers, IEEE float values, or 24-bit RGB
triplets and convert them into an MRC image file. In MRC files, the
data start in the lower left hand corner of the image, with the data
stored in rows. To use <code>raw2mrc</code>, you need to know the
size of the images, the type of data, and the size of any header
information preceding the image. &nbsp;For example, if you have a set
of files (cell01.em, cell02.em, ...) with 1024 x 1024 images of signed
16-bit integers, and a header of 512 bytes, use:</dd>
  <dd><br>
  </dd>
  <dd><code>raw2mrc -t short -x 1024 -y 1024 -o 512 cell*.em cell.mrc</code><br>
  </dd>
  <dd>
    <p>If the data need to have their bytes swapped because they come
a
machine with the opposite byte ordering (e.g. SGI versus PC), use the
-s
option. &nbsp;If you do not know the something about the image, such as
the header size or whether the data are unsigned or need swapping,
you may be able to figure it just by trying different options for data
types and swapping. &nbsp;If you do not know the header size, convert
one file without the -o option, load it into 3dmod, and try to see
where the image data start. If the final MRC image is upside down use
the -f option in the initial conversion or use the program <a
 href="man/clip.html">clip</a> to flip the image back. </p>
    <p> As of IMOD 2.6.20, our image file format was changed to
conform
to the MRC image2000 standard. Programs now read files in either the
new or the old format and write files in the new format. Older
versions of IMOD will interpret these new files as having strange
origin values. If you are running an older version and you have to
work with one of these files (or any MRC file conforming to the new
standard), you can fix the origin values with: </p>
    <pre>alterheader filename<br>org<br>0,0,0<br>done<br></pre>
  </dd>
  <dd>
    <h4>The Model Format</h4>
    <p> If you already have a 3-D model and wish to view it within
the IMOD model viewing program, <code>3dmodv</code>, you will need to
convert the file into the IMOD format. See the IMOD model file
format <a href="asciispec.html">ASCII</a> and <a href="binspec.html">binary
specifications</a> if you wish to write your own conversion program.
Model files from the HVEM3D program can be converted to the IMOD
model format using the <a href="man/rec2imod.html">rec2imod</a>
program. </p>
    <p> The IMOD model format can be either binary or ASCII.
Currently
supported machines can all read and write binary model files
interchangeably, so the main use of the ASCII format would be to
access the data for analysis or conversion by other programs. To
convert a binary IMOD file (binary.imod) to an ASCII IMOD file
(ascii.imod) use the <a href="man/imodinfo.html">imodinfo</a> command
: </p>
    <p><code>imodinfo -a binary.imod &gt; ascii.imod</code> <br>
or <br>
    <code>imodinfo -a -f ascii.imod binary.imod</code> <br>
will both create an ASCII model file from the binary.imod model. </p>

  <hr> <a name="Aligning Images">
  <h3>Aligning Images</h3>
  </a> </dt>
Sometimes images in a data set are not in register with one another.
When this happens, a series of transforms will need to be found that
will align the whole stack of images. This series of transformations
is obtained in two stages. First, each successive pair of images is
considered separately, and a transform is found that aligns the
images when applied to the second image in the pair. This procedure
yields a list of transforms that align each image to the previous
image; the programs consistently refer to this as a list of "f"
transforms. If you think about it, you will realize that simply
applying these f transforms to all of the images in the stack will not
help, because each section would be aligned to the previous one only if
that previous one were not itself transformed. A second stage is thus
necessary: one must obtain the transforms for each image that will
produce an aligned stack when actually applied to the images. This list
is consistently referred to as a list of "g" transforms. In summary,
"f" transforms align each section to the preceding one; "g" transforms
align each section to the whole stack.
<p>There are three general methods for obtaining alignment
transforms:
manual adjustment of transformation parameters, solving for a transform
from a set of fiducial points that correspond between two sections, and
automated search for the best fit between two images. </p>

    <h4><a name="AutomaticAlignment">Automatic Image Alignment</a></h4>
    <a name="AutomaticAlignment"> </a> Several programs are used for
automated image alignment. The programs used are <a
 href="man/xfalign.html">xfalign</a>, <a href="man/xftoxg.html">xftoxg</a>,<a
 href="man/midas.html"> midas</a> and <a href="man/newstack.html">newstack</a>.
Xfalign is a csh script that generates a "f" transform list using the <a

images using the <a href="man/enhance.html">enhance</a> program. It
also
has an option to get an initial alignment of the images by
cross-correlation, in case images are not already roughly aligned.
    <p>Steps and programs used in automatic image alignment: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a "f" transform list by using the xfalign program.<br>
        <code>xfalign cell.mrc cell.xf</code><br>
Expect the alignment for each section to take several seconds
to compute. The file, cell.xf, will contain information on how to align
adjacent images to one another. </li>
      <li>The next step is to analyze the the file cell.xf and the
transforms needed to bring all of the images in alignment with on
another. Use<code></code> <a href="man/xftoxg.html">xftoxg</a> to
create a global "g"
transform list from the "f" transform list:
        <p> <code> xftoxg cell.xf </code> </p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li>The output file from that command, cell.xg, should contain
all of the information needed to make new aligned images from the old
unaligned images. Use the <a href="man/newstack.html">newstack</a>
program to create the new aligned images. The
following example will create an aligned file newcell.mrc from the
old cell.mrc image file.
        <p><code> newstack -xform test.xg test.mrc newtest.mrc </code>
        </p>
        <p> If the automatic alignment is not always correct, it can
be
adjusted with the <a href="man/midas.html">midas</a> program. Start
the
program with: </p>
        <p><code> midas test.mrc test.xf </code> </p>
        <p>A window will open up and you can view the alignment
between
any given pair of adjacent images. After making adjustments for any
sections that are out of alignment, save the transforms and exit the
program. Then rerun the <code>xftoxg</code> and <code>newstack</code>
commands shown above. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that <a href="man/newstack.html"><code>newstack</code></a>
and some of the other programs will not work with 24-bit color
images.&nbsp; Use the "-g" option to <a href="man/tif2mrc.html"><code>tif2mrc</code></a>
to convert to gray scale when making the MRC stack.&nbsp; If you do
need to preserve the color information, then you can split the color
into three separate byte-mode files with the&nbsp; <code><a
 href="man/clip.html">clip</a></code> program, determine the alignment
with one color channel, apply the trasnformations to each of the 3
files separately, then merge the data again with <code><a
