    <h4>Setting Up a PC to Run IMOD.</h4>
         The recommended configuration for running the IMOD software is:
                                        
    <p> Processor:  Intel Pentium III or 4 or AMD Athlon <br>
         Video Card:  GeForce 2 MX, Geforce2 GTS, Geforce2 GTS  Ultra, GeForce3,
    GeForce 4 (64 MB or 128 MB cards preferred) <br>
         Minimum memory size:  256MB <br>
         Minimum disk size:          10 GB <br>
         Operating System:  Red Hat 7.3 or higher Workstation class installation<br>
         Nvidia Linux device drivers and OpenGL libraries from <a
 href="http://www.nvidia.com">Nvidia</a>, at least version 3123 or higher. 
        <br>
         For Red Hat 7.1 - 7.3, to work with files bigger than 2 GB, version
  6.11   or higher of <code>tcsh</code>. <br>
         </p>
                                               
    <p> The required or recommended steps for each operating system are: 
   </p>
                                               
    <p> <b>Red Hat 8.0 - 9.0</b> </p>

    <p> <b>Nvidia installation (all systems).</b> Installing Nvidia drivers
    has recently become much easier, but here are some <a
 href="nvidia_install.txt">instructions</a> that may be helpful.  In addition,
    here is a sample of a <a href="XF86Config7.1.txt">/etc/X11/XF86Config-4</a>
    file from Red Hat 7.1. </p>
                                               
    <p>      <b>Qt 3.0.5 upgrade (Red Hat 7.3).</b> 3dmod for Red Hat 7.3
    was compiled against version 3.0.5 of Qt and will not run on the basic
 installation   of 7.3.  Use <code>rpm -q qt</code> to check which version
 is installed.      <code></code> To upgrade, download <a
 href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/rh7.3/qt-3.0.5-7.14.i386.rpm">Qt 3.0.5</a>
    and, as root, enter <code>rpm -Uhv qt-3.0.5*.rpm .</code> </p>
          </dd>
  <dd>                                             
    <p><b>Window manager settings (all systems).</b>  To keep 3dmod from
bogging down when it is displaying complex models, the window manager needs
to be set to display only the outline and not the contents of windows when
they are moved or resized.  In Red Hat 7.3, this could be done by selecting
"box" rather than "opaque" in the "Moving and Resizing" panel of the Gnome
control center.  In Red Hat 8.0 or 9.0, this cannot be done under Gnome but
it can under KDE, by opening up the Control Center and selecting "Look and
Feel" or "Desktop" (depending on KDE version), then "Window Behavior" then
the "Moving" panel.  </p>
                                                 
    <p> <b>tcsh for large files (Red Hat 7.1 - 7.3).</b>  As of IMOD 2.6.0, 
    programs have been compiled to work with files bigger than 2 GB.  However,
    the <code>tcsh 6.10</code> distributed with Red Hat 7.1-7.3 has problems
   with large files, and some of the IMOD shell scripts will fail with large
   files under this tcsh. For doing tomography with large files, you need
to   upgrade to <code>tcsh 6.11</code>, which is available as an <a
 href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/rh7.3/tcsh-6.11-3mdk.i586.rpm">rpm</a>. 
     </p>
                                               
    <h4>Installing IMOD</h4>
         All of the IMOD programs are available via the  <a
 href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/download.html">IMOD Download Page</a> 
    The distribution is bundled together using the Unix tar program and compressed 
    using the gzip program.                                         
    <p> The easiest thing to do is to install to our recommended location, 
    /usr/local/IMOD.  The following steps are used in this case. The specific
    file names are used as an example; your copy may have higher version
numbers.         </p>
                                               
    <ol>
         <li> Log in as root or do all of these commands with sudo </li>
              <li> cd to the directory where you downloaded IMOD, and  <br>
                <code> mv imod_3.0.8_rh8.0.tar.gz /usr/local</code> </li>
              <li><code> cd /usr/local</code> </li>
              <li><code> gunzip imod_3.0.8_rh8.0.tar.gz</code> </li>
              <li><code> tar xvf imod_3.0.8_rh8.0.tar</code> </li>
              <li>To see if you already have a /usr/local/IMOD, <br>
                <code> ls -l</code> </li>
              <li>If you do have a /usr/local/IMOD and it is a link (e.g.,
 it  shows  up as <code> IMOD -&gt; imod_2.7.6</code>), then enter <br>
                <code> rm IMOD</code> <br>
        Otherwise, rename the existing directory, e.g.: <br>
                <code> mv IMOD oldIMOD</code> </li>
              <li><code> ln -s imod_3.0.8 IMOD</code> </li>
              <li> (A) Under Linux, enter <br>
                <code> cp IMOD/IMOD-linux.* /etc/profile.d</code> <br>
         (B) On an SGI, insert the text in <code>IMOD/sgi.cshrc</code> into 
          <code>/etc/cshrc</code>,   specifically the command <br>
                <code>if (-e /usr/local/IMOD/IMOD-sgi.csh) source /usr/local/IMOD/IMOD-sgi.csh 
            </code></li>
                                               
    </ol>
            </dd>
</dl>
                 
<dl>
  <dd>If you are upgrading IMOD using the above procedures, and your previous
    installation used another method for setting the environment variables
 for   users, be sure to remove whatever commands were used before. &nbsp;These
   might have been placed in <code>/etc/cshrc</code>, <code>/usr/local/etc/cshrc</code>,
    or users' <code>.cshrc</code>, <code>.bashrc</code>, or <code>.profile</code>
    files. &nbsp;The advantage of the new procedure is that future upgrades
  will  be easier, especially if the startup files change.</dd>
  <dd><br>
          </dd>
  <dd>If you want to install at another location, change <code>/usr/local/IMOD</code>
    to the name of the top IMOD directory in the relevant <code>IMOD-*.*</code>
    files and in the source command placed in <code>/etc/cshrc</code> on
an   SGI.</dd>
</dl>
                 
<dl>
  <dd>If you do not want a system wide installation, instead of step 9 above,
    then under Linux, place the following in the <code>.cshrc</code> files
 of   individual users of <code>tcsh</code> (where &lt;location of IMOD&gt;
 is  the absolute path to the IMOD directory):</dd>
  <dd><code>setenv IMOD_DIR &lt;location of IMOD&gt;</code></dd>
  <dd><code>if (-e $IMOD_DIR/IMOD-linux.csh) source $IMOD_DIR/IMOD-linux.csh 
        </code></dd>
</dl>
                 
<dl>
  <dd>or, place the following in the <code>.bashrc</code> of individual users
    under <code>bash</code>:</dd>
  <dd><code>export IMOD_DIR=&lt;location of IMOD&gt;</code></dd>
  <dd><code>if [ -e $IMOD_DIR/IMOD-linux.sh ] ; then source $IMOD_DIR/IMOD-linux.sh
    ; fi</code></dd>
</dl>
                 
<dl>
  <dd>or, on an SGI, place the following in the <code>.cshrc</code> files
    of individual users:</dd>
  <dd><code>setenv IMOD_DIR &lt;location of IMOD&gt;</code></dd>
  <dd><code>if (-e $IMOD_DIR/IMOD-sgi.csh) source $IMOD_DIR/IMOD-sgi.csh</code></dd>
</dl>
                 
<dl>
  <dd>Finally, if you just want to try running the programs in a particular 
    copy of IMOD, cd to the top IMOD directory and, on Linux under <code>tcsh</code>,
    enter:</dd>
  <dd>  <code>setenv IMOD_DIR `pwd`</code></dd>
  <dd><code>source IMOD-linux.csh   </code></dd>
</dl>
                 
<dl>
  <dd>and similarly on the SGI, sourcing <code>IMOD-sgi.csh</code>.  On Linux
    under <code>bash</code>, enter:</dd>
  <dd><code>export IMOD_DIR=`pwd`</code></dd>
  <dd><code>source IMOD-linux.sh</code></dd>
</dl>
                 
<dl>
  <dd>                                             
    <h4>TIFF Library Support</h4>
          The 3dmod program is able to read TIFF files if the library  <code>libtiff.so</code> 
    is available.  Versions compiled for IRIX 6.5 and the PC under Linux assume
    that the library is available.                                      
  
    <p> If you are trying to run a version that is compiled for the library
    but the  library is not on your system, <code>3dmod</code> and several
 other   programs  will not run until you rename a dummy library, <code>nolibtiff.so</code>,
    to  <code>libtiff.so</code>.  From the top IMOD directory, do the following: 
        </p>
                                               
    <pre>cd lib<br>mv nolibtiff.so libtiff.so<br></pre>
         and, on the SGI only, continue with:                           
             
    <pre>cd ../lib32<br>mv nolibtiff.so libtiff.so<br></pre>
                                                 
    <p> Conversely, if you have a version that does not assume the library
    and you do have the library (whose source you  can obtain from  <a
 href="ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff">SGI</a>), then to use the library,
    you need to remove or rename the dummy <code>libtiff.so</code> in the
     <code>IMOD/lib</code>   directory.    </p>
                                               
    <h4>Fast Backprojection Support</h4>
         The Tilt program now contains a fast backprojection algorithm developed
    by Gregory Beylkin and Kristian Sandberg at the University of Colorado.
   This method produces reconstructions 1.5-2.5 times faster, depending on
 the size of the slice being reconstructed (the larger, the better).  It
works    when there is tilt around the X-axis but not with local alignments.
  To   take advantage of the algorithm, you need a license to use the USFFT
library,   which is commercial software for doing unequally spaced FFTs.
 A license  is free for non-profit organizations.  To obtain a license, contact
    <a href="mailto:mast@colorado.edu"> David Mastronarde</a> with a request
and     a description of your institution.  Once you have the license, you
need   to  set environment variable USFFT2_LICENSE_FILE to point to the license
 file.  This is already done in the startup files suppiled with IMOD.  The
 program  will use standard backprojection if there is no license.  </dd>

    <h4>The Image Data Format and File Conversion</h4>
         All of the IMOD programs use the   <a href="mrc_format.txt">MRC
image    file  format</a>. We have utility programs available for converting
TIFF   files,  SGI rgb files and raw data into the MRC file format.     
                                   
    <p> Use the program  <a href="man/tif2mrc.html">tif2mrc</a> to convert
    a series of TIFF image  files into a single MRC image file.  The <code>tif2mrc</code>
    program has an option for converting 24-bit color to 8-bit grayscale
images,    and options for dealing with unsigned 16 bit images, which are
a potential    problem because the MRC format supports only signed 16-bit
images.  The  following  example will create a MRC file from a list of TIFF
files (cell01.tif,   cell02.tif  ...). </p>
                                               
    <p><code> tif2mrc cell??.tif  cell.mrc </code> </p>
                                               
    <p>See the  <a href="man/tif2mrc.html">tif2mrc manual page</a> for more
    information on how to use  <code>tif2mrc</code>.  </p>
                                               
    <p> The program  <a href="man/raw2mrc.html">raw2mrc</a> is used to convert
    raw image data into the mrc format.  This program can take a file of
8  or   16 bit integers, IEEE float values, or 24-bit RGB triplets and convert
 them  into an MRC image file. In MRC files, the data start in the lower
left  hand  corner of the image, with the data stored in rows.  To use <code>raw2mrc</code>, 
  you need to know the size of the images, the type of data, and the size 
of  any header information preceding the image. &nbsp;For example, if you 
have  a set of files (cell01.em, cell02.em, ...) with 1024 x 1024 images of
signed  16-bit integers, and a header of 512 bytes, use:</p>
       </dd>
  <dd><code>raw2mrc -t short -x 1024 -y 1024 -o 512 cell*.em cell.mrc</code><br>
       </dd>
  <dd>                         
    <p>If the data need to have their bytes swapped because they come a machine 
  with the opposite byte ordering (e.g. SGI versus PC), use the -s option. 
 &nbsp;If you do not know the something about the image, such as the header 
 size or whether the data are unsigned or need swapping, you may be able to
 figure it just by trying different options for data types and swapping. &nbsp;If
  you do not know the header size, convert one file without the -o option,
 load it into 3dmod, and try to see where the image data start. If the final
 MRC image is upside down use the -f option in the initial conversion or
use  the program  <a href="man/clip.html">clip</a> to flip the image back. 
 </p>
                                               
    <p> As of IMOD 2.6.20, our image file format was changed to conform to
    the MRC image2000 standard.  Programs now read files in either the new
 or   the old format and write files in the new format.  Older versions of
 IMOD   will  interpret these new files as having strange origin values.
 If you  are running an older version and you have to work with one of these
files  (or any MRC file conforming to the new standard), you can fix the
origin values with: </p>
                                               
    <pre>alterheader filename<br>org<br>0,0,0<br>done<br></pre>
          </dd>
  <dd>                                         
    <h4>The Model Format</h4>
                                                 
    <p> If you already have a 3-D model and wish to view it within theIMOD 
    model viewing program, <code>3dmodv</code>, you will need to convert the
   file into the IMOD format.  See the IMOD model file format  <a
 href="asciispec.html">ASCII</a> and <a href="binspec.html">binary specifications</a>
     if you wish to write your own conversion program.  Model files from
the    HVEM3D program can be converted to the IMOD model format using the
    <a href="man/rec2imod.html">rec2imod</a> program.  </p>
                                               
    <p> The IMOD model format can be either binary or ASCII.  Currently supported 
    machines can all read and write binary model files interchangeably, so 
 the   main use of the ASCII format would be to access the data for analysis 
 or  conversion by other programs. To convert a binary IMOD file (binary.imod) 
   to an ASCII  IMOD file (ascii.imod) use the  <a
 href="man/imodinfo.html">imodinfo</a>   command : </p>
                                               
    <p><code>imodinfo -a binary.imod &gt; ascii.imod</code> <br>
        or <br>
            <code>imodinfo -a -f ascii.imod binary.imod</code> <br>
        will both create an ASCII model file from the binary.imod model.
    </p>
                                               
    <p><i> There exists an older model format which was used on our VaxStation
    running the WIMP program.  The programs  written in Fortran use the WIMP
   format internally.  They will read  models in either WIMP or IMOD format
  and output models in IMOD format. </i>    </p>

    <h3>Aligning Images</h3>
            </a> </dt>
  <dd> Sometimes images in a data set are not in register with one another. 
    When this happens, a series of transforms will need to be found that will
   align the whole stack of images.   This series of transformations is obtained
   in two stages.  First, each successive pair of images is considered separately,
   and a transform is found that aligns the images when applied to the second
   image in the pair.  This procedure yields a list of transforms that align
   each image to the previous image; the programs consistently refer to this
   as a list of "f" transforms.  If you think about it, you will realize
that    simply applying these f transforms to all of the images in the stack
will    not help, because each section would be aligned to the previous one
only   if that previous one were not itself transformed.  A second stage
is thus   necessary: one must obtain the transforms for each image that will
produce   an aligned stack when actually applied to the images.  This list
is consistently   referred to as a list of "g" transforms.  In summary, "f"
transforms align   each section to the preceding one; "g" transforms align
each section to the  whole stack.                                       
  
    <p>There are three general methods for obtaining alignment transforms: 
    manual adjustment of transformation parameters, solving for a transform 
  from a set of fiducial points that  correspond between two sections, and 
 automated search for the best fit between two images.  </p>

    <h4>Manual Image Alignment</h4>
         The program <a href="man/midas.html">midas</a> is used for manual
 alignment    or manual adjustments to automated alignment of images. <code>Midas</code>
    can be used to create a transform list or to edit an  existing list;
it   can  work with either "f" or "g" transform lists. To get a "g" transform
 list from an "f" transform list use the <a href="man/xftoxg.html">xftoxg</a>
 program.   <code>xftoxg</code> has options to  leave long term trends in
the data, which are invoked by default when you call it with the <code>xf2xg</code>
   shell script.   </dd>
  <dd>                                         
    <h4>Image Alignment using Fiducial Markers.</h4>
          The program <a href="man/xfmodel.html">xfmodel</a>  will create 
a  list   of xf transforms from a model containing fiducial points.   See 
the  <a href="3dmodguide.html">Introduction to 3dmod</a> to see 
how to make models.

    <ul>
         	<li><code>imod</code> : Creates a model in which points in each 
contour     are placed on adjacent sections that mark the same area on  both 
sections.     Note that a single contour corresponds to a single fiducial 
marker, and   the contour contains a point on each of the sections where the
marker appears.     These are contours that pass between sections rather 
than being confined    to a single section. 	</li>
              <li><code>xfmodel</code> : Creates a "f" transform list. 	</li>
              <li><code>xftoxg</code> : Creates a "g" transform list, leaving

    <h4>Automatic Image Alignment</h4>
         Several programs are used for automated image alignment.  The programs 
   used are  <a href="man/xfalign.html">xfalign</a>,  <a
 href="man/xftoxg.html">xftoxg</a>,  <a href="man/midas.html">midas</a> and 
       <a href="man/newstack.html">newstack</a>.    Xfalign is a csh script 
  that  generates a "f" transform list using the     <a
 href="man/xfsimplex.html">xfsimplex</a> program.  It can prefilter images 
   using the  <a href="man/enhance.html">enhance</a> program.   It also has 
  an option to get an initial alignment of the images by cross-correlation, 
   in case images are not already roughly aligned.                       
                   
    <p>Steps and programs used in automatic image alignment: </p>
                                               
    <ul>
          <li>Create a "f" transform list by using the xfalign program.<br>
         <code>xfalign cell.mrc cell.xf</code><br>
         Expect the alignment for each section to take on the order of a
minute    to compute. The file, cell.xf, will contain information on how
to align  adjacent   images to one another.  </li>
              <li>The next step is to analyze the the file cell.xf and  the 
 transforms   needed to bring all of the images in alignment with  on another. 
   Use the           <code>xf2xg</code> shell script, an interface to the 
        <a href="man/xftoxg.html">xftoxg</a> program, to create a global "g"
transform   list from the "f" transform list:                           
                                             
        <p> <code> xf2xg cell.xf </code> </p>
                                                                        
      
        <p> </p>
              </li>
              <li>The output file from that command, cell.xg, should contain
  all   of the information needed to make new aligned images from the old
unaligned    images. Use the  <a href="man/newstack.html">newstack</a> program
to create    the new aligned images.  The  <a href="man/newst.html">newst</a>
shell script   acts as a front end to the newstack program and allows for
easier command   line options. The following example will create an aligned
file newcell.mrc   from the old cell.mrc image file.                    
                                                    
        <p><code> newst -xform test.xg test.mrc newtest.mrc </code> </p>
                                                                        
      
        <p> If the automatic alignment is not always correct, it can be adjusted
    with the <a href="man/midas.html">midas</a> program.  Start the program
  with:          </p>
                                                                        
      
        <p><code> midas test.mrc test.xf </code> </p>
                                                                        
      
        <p>A window will open up and you can view the alignment between any
    given pair of adjacent images.  After making adjustments for any sections
    that are out of alignment, save the transforms and exit the program.
 Then    rerun the <code>xf2xg</code> and <code>newst</code> commands shown
above.            </p>
              </li>
                                               
    </ul>

  <h3>Getting Quantitative Information</h3></a>
In order to get accurate information the fields in the model header have
to be set properly.  See the <a href="3dmodguide.html">Introduction to 3dmod</a>
&nbsp;for an explanation of how to do this. Selecting the Edit-&gt;Object-&gt;Info
 or Edit-&gt;Contour-&gt;Info   menu item from the 3dmod Information Window
   will cause the quantitative information to be printed out in the bottom
 panel  of the window.            
  <p> Use the  <a href="man/imodinfo.html">imodinfo</a> command to get basic 
   information from a model and print it out to a terminal or file.  For
