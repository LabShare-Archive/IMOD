    <h3>Installation</h3>
    </a> </dt>
All of the IMOD programs are available via the <a
 href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/download.html">IMOD Download Page</a>.
&nbsp;The distribution is bundled together using the Unix tar program
with gzip compression, then placed in a file after a C shell script
that can extract and install the programs.&nbsp; If you are willing to
install to the default location in the system and set up the IMOD
environment for all users in the default way, then you can install
simply by running this
script, e.g.,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>csh -f imod_3.11.2_FC2.csh</code><br>
  <br>
(In this guide, the specific filenames are used as an example; your
copy may have higher version numbers.) <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">You cannot click on the file to
install it.</span>&nbsp; If you have
followed our recommended installation procedures
since IMOD 3.0.8, you will be able to upgrade using the same
command. If you want to install to a location other than the
default,&nbsp; you can specify the desired location,
e.g.,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>csh -f imod_3.11.2_FC2.csh -dir /opt</code><br>
  <br>
Older versions will be renamed, and at the end the installation script
will offer to remove them for you.&nbsp; People with special
requirements not anticipated by the install script may need to work
with
the tar file instead.&nbsp; It can be extracted with:<br>
&nbsp; <code>csh -f imod_3.11.2_FC2.csh -extract<br>
  </code><br>
The gzipped tar file and the install script will be left in a
subdirectory named <code>IMODtempDir.</code>&nbsp; There are two other
useful options: <code>-script </code>to install
startup scripts to a different location, and <code>-skip</code> to
skip installing startup scripts.&nbsp; Use:<br>
</dl>
<code>csh -f imod_3.11.2_FC2.csh -help</code>
<dl>
to see all available options.&nbsp; The sections below on individual
machine types describe what will be
done by the default installation procedure and list the steps for
doing a manual installation instead of using the self-installing
package.<br>

    <h4>Setting Up a Linux PC to Run IMOD.</h4>
The recommended configuration for
running the IMOD software is:
    <p> Processor: Almost any Intel or AMD processor from the last 5
years will run adequately<br>
Video Card: any relatively modern Nvidia card (GeForce or Quadro, 64 MB
or higher cards preferred)<br>
Minimum memory size: 512MB <br>
Minimum disk size: 15 GB <br>
Operating System: Red Hat Workstation 4 or Fedora 4 or higher<br>
Nvidia Linux device drivers and OpenGL libraries from <a
 href="http://www.nvidia.com">Nvidia</a>, at least version 8776 or
higher due to security concerns<br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Nvidia installation.</b> Installing Nvidia
drivers is now fairly straightforward, but
here are some <a href="nvidia_install.txt">instructions</a> that may
be helpful. The latest versions of the drivers change the Driver line
in /etc/X11/xorg.conf from "nv" to "nvidia" if you accept their offer
to modify the file.&nbsp; In
addition, here is a sample of a <a href="xorg.conf-FC.txt">/etc/X11/xorg.conf</a>
file from Fedora Core 4, set up to use an old 24-inch Sony
monitor.&nbsp; On Ubuntu, the installation through Synaptic Package
Manager should be adequate.<br>
    </p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dd>
    <p><b>Compatibility packages for Fedora Core 4 or higher.</b> One
or two
packages not in the default installation are needed to run IMOD under
a fresh installation of FC4 on up.&nbsp; If you are running a version
of IMOD built under FC4, you
need compat-libf2c.&nbsp; The reason for this is that the Fortran
compiler g77 has been
declared "legacy" even though its successor, gfortran, is too buggy to
rely on yet.&nbsp; To install this, use:</p>
  </dd>
  <dd><code>&nbsp; sudo yum install 'compat-libf2c-*'</code><br>
  </dd>
  <dd>If this does not work, here is a <a
 href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/FC78/compat-libf2c-34-3.4.6-7.i386.rpm">
32-bit rpm</a> and <a
 href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/FC78/compat-libf2c-34-3.4.6-7.x86_64.rpm">
64-bit rpm</a> for FC7, and a <a
 href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/FC78/compat-libf2c-34-3.4.6-8.i386.rpm">
32-bit rpm</a> and <a
 href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/FC78/compat-libf2c-34-3.4.6-8.x86_64.rpm">
64-bit rpm</a> for FC8. </dd>
  <dd>If a package like this with <code>libg2c.so</code> is not
available (such as on Suse 10.3), then add the <code>-libg2c</code>
option to the command line when you install IMOD, and a copy of this
library inside IMOD will be used if it is available in the package that
you are installing from.&nbsp; On Ubuntu, the library is available if
you install g77 itself, but do not bother with this; the IMOD install
script will automatically apply the <code>-libg2c </code>option on
Ubuntu if the library is not on the system.<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>
    <p>If you are running an IMOD built under FC2, you also
need compat-libstdc++-33, which you can install with:</p>
  </dd>
  <dd>
    <p><code>&nbsp; </code><code>sudo yum install compat-libstdc++-33</code>
    </p>
    <p><b>Window manager settings.</b> To keep 3dmod from
bogging down when it is displaying complex models, the window manager
can be set to display only the outline and not the contents of
windows when they are moved or resized.&nbsp; This cannot be done under
Gnome but it can under KDE, by opening up the
Control Center and selecting "Look and Feel" or "Desktop" (depending on
KDE version), then "Window Behavior" then the "Moving" panel.&nbsp;
Both <code>3dmod</code> and <code>eTomo</code> have problems under
Compiz, so you should disable this.&nbsp; On Ubuntu, open the menu
entry System - Preferences - Visual Effects and select "No effects".<br>
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dd>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">tcsh for Ubuntu.</span> You
must install <code>tcsh </code>even if you also have <code>csh </code>installed.&nbsp;
Things should work with both installed, but it would be safer to have
only <code>tcsh</code>.&nbsp; You can install <code>tcsh </code>through
the Synaptic Package Manager or with:</p>
  </dd>
  <dd>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>sudo apt-get install tcsh</code><br>
    </p>
    <a name="InstallingLinuxSGI">
    <h4>Installing IMOD on a Linux PC<br>
    </h4>
    </a>
    <p> The self-installing package will install to a directory named <code>IMOD</code>
under <code>/usr/local</code>
unless given an alternate location to <code>/usr/local</code> with the
    <code>-dir</code>
option.&nbsp; It will copy the startup scripts <code>IMOD-linux.sh </code>and
    <code>IMOD-linux.csh </code>to <code>/etc/profile.d</code>.
unless given an alternate
location with the <code>-script</code> option or told to skip this
step with the <code>-skip</code> option, or unless you are running
Ubuntu or give the <code>-debian</code> option.&nbsp; It the latter
cases, it will modify <code>/etc/bash.bashrc</code> and <code>/etc/csh.cshrc</code>
to source the startup scripts from the IMOD directory, unless you give
the <code>-skip</code> option.&nbsp; To accomplish all
of this, change directory to the place where the package is located and
enter, for example:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>sudo csh </code><code>-f
imod_3.11.2_FC2.csh</code><br>
    <br>
You will have to open a new window, or possibly even log out and
log back in, for the installation to take effect.<br>
    </p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dd>If you are upgrading IMOD using the default procedures, and your
previous installation used another method for setting the environment
variables for users, be sure to remove whatever commands were used
before. &nbsp;These might have been placed in <code>/etc/cshrc</code>,<code>
/usr/local/etc/cshrc</code>,
or users' <code>.cshrc</code>, <code>.bashrc</code>, or <code>.bash_profile</code>
files. &nbsp;The advantage of the current procedure is that future
upgrades
will be easier, especially if the startup files change.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dd>You would skip the installation of the startup scripts if you do
not want a system wide installation, or if you are installing to a
server to be accessed by multiple workstations. In this case, you would
place the following in the <code>.cshrc</code>
files of individual users of <code>tcsh</code> (where &lt;location of
IMOD&gt; is the absolute path to the IMOD directory):</dd>
  <dd><code>setenv IMOD_DIR &lt;location of IMOD&gt;</code></dd>
  <dd><code>if (-e $IMOD_DIR/IMOD-linux.csh) source
$IMOD_DIR/IMOD-linux.csh </code></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dd>or, place the following in the <code>.bash_profile</code> of
individual
users under <code>bash</code>:</dd>
  <dd><code>export IMOD_DIR=&lt;location of IMOD&gt;</code></dd>
  <dd><code>if [ -e $IMOD_DIR/IMOD-linux.sh ] ; then source
$IMOD_DIR/IMOD-linux.sh ; fi</code></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dd>Alternatively, if there are system-wide startup scripts sourced
from the users' <code>.cshrc</code> or <code>.bash_profile</code>,
you would place these commands in the system-wide startup
scripts.&nbsp; You should always source the startup script that comes
with an IMOD distribution, not make a copy of the startup script and
incorporate it into other scripts.<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>
    <p>To install manually from the tar file, do the following steps
after running the self-installing file with the <code>-extract</code>
option:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li> Log in as root or do all of these commands with sudo </li>
      <li> cd to the directory where you downloaded IMOD, and <br>
        <code> mv imod_3.11.2_FC2.tar.gz /usr/local</code> </li>
      <li><code> cd /usr/local</code> </li>
      <li><code> tar -xzf imod_3.11.2_FC2.tar.gz</code> </li>
      <li>To see if you already have a /usr/local/IMOD, <br>
        <code> ls -l</code> </li>
      <li>If you do have a /usr/local/IMOD and it is a link (e.g., it
shows up as <code> IMOD -&gt; imod_2.7.6</code>), then enter <br>
        <code> rm IMOD</code> <br>
Otherwise, rename the existing directory, e.g.: <br>
        <code> mv IMOD oldIMOD</code> </li>
      <li><code> ln -s imod_3.11.2 IMOD</code> </li>
      <li>Except on Ubuntu and other Debian systems,<br>
        <code>cp IMOD/IMOD-linux.* /etc/profile.d</code> <code></code></li>
    </ol>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
</dl>
<dl>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dd>On Ubuntu when installing manually, instead of step 8, you would
insert commands into <code>/etc/csh.cshrc</code> and <code>/etc/bash.bashrc</code>
just like those given above for inserting in users' <code>.cshrc</code>
and <code>.bash_profile</code> files, respectively.&nbsp; If your
system does not have <code>/usr/lib/libtiff.so.3</code>, then<br>
    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp; cd $IMOD_DIR/lib<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libtiff.so.4 libtiff.so.3<br>
    </code>If your Ubuntu system does not have <code>/usr/lib/libg2c.so</code>,
then rename each of the <code>libg2c</code> files in the IMOD <code>lib</code>
directory, for example:<br>
    <code>cd $IMOD_DIR/lib<br>
sudo mv imod-libg2c.so libg2c.so<br>
    </code><code>sudo mv imod-libg2c.so.0 libg2c.so.0</code><br>
    <code>sudo mv imod-libg2c.so.0.0.0 libg2c.so.0.0.0</code><br>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dd>Finally, if you just want to try running the programs in a
particular copy of IMOD, cd to the top IMOD directory and, under <code>tcsh</code>,
enter:</dd>
  <dd> <code>setenv IMOD_DIR `pwd`</code></dd>
  <dd><code>source IMOD-linux.csh </code></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dd><code></code><code>3dmod</code> may fail to run if another
installed package has placed an incompatible Qt or OpenGL library on
your library load path.&nbsp; The sign of a problem with the Qt library
is an error message about an undefined symbol, usually a very long
string containing "QGLWidget".&nbsp; The remedy for these problems
depends on whether
your IMOD&nbsp; distribution has a Qt library included.&nbsp; <br>
  </dd>
</dl>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>If the distribution has a Qt library, you will find <code>IMOD-localQt.sh</code>
and <code>IMOD-localQt.csh</code> in the top IMOD directory.&nbsp; Use
these to replace the startup files in <code>/etc/profile.d</code>:<br>
      <code>sudo cp IMOD-localQt.sh /etc/profile.d/IMOD-linux.sh<br>
      </code><code>sudo cp IMOD-localQt.csh
/etc/profile.d/IMOD-linux.csh</code><br>
    </li>
    <li>&nbsp;If your distribution does not have a Qt library, the top
IMOD directory contains
two
files, <code>IMOD-qtconflict.sh</code> and <code>IMOD-qtconflict.csh</code>,
that can be used to solve the problem. &nbsp;Try sourcing the
appropriate file, then try following the directions in the file and
sourcing it again. &nbsp;If this solves the problem, make any needed
changes to both files and copy them to <code>/etc/profile.d,</code>
without deleting <code>IMOD-linux.*sh</code>.<code><br>

  <h4>Installing Java on a Linux PC<br>
  </h4>
  </a>Etomo is a Java 2 application and thus requires a Java runtime
environment (JRE) with a version of 1.4 or better to be
installed.&nbsp; Etomo will not work with the GNU Java that is
currently distributed with Fedora Core, so you will need a Sun
version.&nbsp; We highly recommend using version 1.5 or 1.6 since 1.5
or
better will almost certainly be required
by the next release of IMOD.&nbsp; Sun's JRE version 1.5.0_6
is
available <a
 href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/java/jre-1_5_0_06-linux-i586.bin">here</a>&nbsp;for
Linux.&nbsp;&nbsp; On Ubuntu, the <code>sun-java6-jre</code> package
available in the Synaptic Package Manager seems to work well; however,
if you do want to install a Sun package in <code>/usr/local</code>
instead, then be aware that you need a 64-bit version for a 64-bit
system.&nbsp; Sun's 64-bit JRE version 1.6.0_7 is available <a
 href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/java/jre-6u7-linux-x64.bin">here</a>;&nbsp;
if you use this, modify all the commands given next appropriately.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-family: monospace;"><code></code></span>To
install the JRE for Linux first move the <code><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">jre-1_5_0_06-linux-i586.bin</span></code>
file
to <code>/usr/local</code>
  <p class="western"><code><span style="font-family: monospace;">sudo
mv </span></code><span style="font-family: monospace;"><code><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">jre-1_5_0_06-linux-i586.bin /usr/local</span></code><br>
  </span></p>
  <p class="western">Next change your working directory to <code>/usr/local</code>
and&nbsp; execute the bin by entering</p>
  <p class="western"><span style="font-family: monospace;"><code>cd
/usr/local</code><br>
  </span></p>
  <p class="western"><span style="font-family: monospace;"><code>sudo
sh
jre-1_5_0_06-linux-i586.bin</code><br>
  </span></p>
  <p class="western">on the command line. &nbsp;</p>
  <p class="western">This will install the JRE in <code>/usr/local/jre1.5.0_06</code>.
&nbsp;The IMOD startup scripts assume that the JRE is in <code>/usr/local/java</code>,
so next create a link: </p>
  <p class="western"><span style="font-family: monospace;"><code>sudo
ln
-s jre1.5.0_06 java</code><br>
  </span></p>
  <span style="font-family: monospace;"><code></code></span>
  <p class="western">If you upgrade to a different JRE, then you just
need to change the link. &nbsp;If you wish to use a different JRE than
the one pointed to by <code>/usr/local/java</code>, you must edit the <code>IMOD-linux.sh</code>
and <code>IMOD-linux.csh</code> scripts in <code>/etc/profile.d</code>
and define the variable IMOD_JAVADIR to specify the directory where the
JRE you wish to use is installed.<br>
  </p>
&nbsp; <br>
  <a name="InstallingMac">
  <h4>Installing IMOD on a Macintosh running OS X</h4>
  </a>Be sure to install the right package for the processor type: <code>_osx_ppc</code>
for a PowerPC (G4, G5, etc) or <code>_osx_intel</code> for an Intel
processor.&nbsp; The self-installing package will install to
/Applications or to
an alternate location with the <code>-dir</code> option.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">It will
not work by clicking on it, only by running it at the command
line.</span>&nbsp; It will
place appropriate "source" commands for defining the user environment
in <code>/etc/csh.login<span style="font-family: sans-serif;"> </span></code>and
  <code>/etc/profile</code>.&nbsp;You
need to be able to use sudo. &nbsp;Open a terminal window (under
Applications-Utilities), change
directory to the place where the package is located, and enter, e.g.:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>sudo csh -f imod_3.11.2_osx_ppc.csh</code><br>
  <br>
&nbsp;You will need to exit and restart Terminal for these changes to
take
effect, or you can just source <code>/etc/csh.login</code>&nbsp;(if
you
are
running tcsh) or <code>/etc/profile</code>&nbsp;(if you are running
bash).
If you are upgrading IMOD with the
default installation
procedures and your previous installation used another method of
setting environment variables, then you may need to remove "source" or
other environment-setting commands from various files, such as <code>/etc/csh.login</code>,
  <code>/etc/profile</code>, or users' <code>.cshrc</code>, <code>.bashrc</code>,
or <code>.profile</code>&nbsp;files.<br>
  <br>
Once you have verified that IMOD programs run after
installing them, you can make some links in <code>/usr/lib</code> to
libraries
in the IMOD directories that will allow you to start 3dmod by clicking
on its icon. &nbsp;Run the <code>linklibs-mac </code>script by
entering:<br>
  <code>&nbsp;&nbsp; sudo $IMOD_DIR/linklibs-mac -i</code><br>
If this creates problems, such as conflicts with other programs that
supply their own Qt libraries, you can remove the links with:<br>
  <code>&nbsp;&nbsp; sudo $IMOD_DIR/linklibs-mac -u<br>
  </code>If you are upgrading IMOD and have done this before, you
should run <code>$IMOD_DIR/linklibs-mac -u </code>before installing
the new version.<br>
  <br>
To install manually from the tar file that you can get by running the
self-installing file with the <code>-extract</code> option, you have
two
alternatives.&nbsp;To do it from the command line, open a Terminal
window and:<br>
  <ol>
    <li> cd to the directory where you downloaded IMOD, and <br>
      <code>sudo mv imod_3.11.2_osx_ppc.tar.gz /Applications</code></li>
    <li><code>cd /Applications</code></li>
    <li><code>sudo tar xzf imod_3.11.2_osx_ppc.tar.gz</code></li>
    <li>To see if you already have a /Applications/IMOD, <br>
      <code> ls -l</code> </li>
    <li>If you do have a /Applications/IMOD and it is a link (e.g., it
shows up as <code> IMOD -&gt; imod_3.1.6</code>), then enter <br>
      <code>sudo rm IMOD</code> <br>
Otherwise, rename the existing directory, e.g.: <br>
      <code>sudo mv IMOD oldIMOD</code> </li>
    <li><code> sudo mv imod_3.11.2 IMOD</code></li>
  </ol>
  <br>
If you are on a single user-machine or have administrative privileges
from the desktop, you can use the following alternative approach:
  <ol>
    <li>Click on the downloaded file to unpack it with Stuffit Expander
and create the IMOD folder, e.g. <code>imod_3.11.2</code></li>
    <li>Drag this folder into the /Applications folder.</li>
    <li>If you already have an IMOD folder in /Applications, rename it
or move it elsewhere.</li>
    <li>Rename the new distribution to IMOD.</li>
  </ol>
  <br>
Whichever approach you use, you need to add some startup commands to
the system files <code>/etc/csh.login </code>and <code>/etc/profile</code>,
unless they are already there from a previous installation of
IMOD.&nbsp;Use sudo to invoke <code>emacs </code>or <code>pico</code>&nbsp;on
these files, .e.g.:<br>
  <code>&nbsp;&nbsp; sudo emacs /etc/csh.login</code><br>
&nbsp;Copy the text in <code>IMOD/mac.cshrc</code>&nbsp;to
the
end of <code>/etc/csh.login</code>, specifically the command <br>
  <code>if (-e /Applications/IMOD/IMOD-mac.csh) source
/Applications/IMOD/IMOD-mac.csh<br>
  <br>
  </code>Similarly, copy the text in <code>IMOD/mac.bashrc</code>&nbsp;to
the end of <code>/etc/profile</code>, specifically the command <br>
  <code>[ -r /Applications/IMOD/IMOD-mac.sh ] &amp;&amp; source
/Applications/IMOD/IMOD-mac.sh</code><br>
  <br>
If you want to install at another location, change <code>/Applications/IMOD</code>&nbsp;to
the name of the top IMOD directory in <code>IMOD-mac.csh<span
 style="font-family: sans-serif;"> </span></code>and <code>IMOD-mac.sh<span
 style="font-family: sans-serif;"> </span></code>and
in the source commands placed in <code>/etc/csh.login </code>and<code>
/etc/profile. </code>If you are sure you are not going to install
somewhere else in the future, you can avoid modifying <code>IMOD-mac.csh</code>
and <code>IMOD-mac.sh</code> by defining IMOD_DIR before the source
commands, i.e. with <br>
  <code>&nbsp;&nbsp; setenv IMOD_DIR &lt;Location_of_IMOD&gt;</code><br>
before the source command in <code>/etc/csh.login,</code> or with<br>
  <code>&nbsp;&nbsp; export IMOD_DIR=&lt;Location_of_IMOD&gt;</code><br>
before the source command in <code>/etc/profile</code>. <br>
See the above instructions for Linux PC for other variations on
installation procedures.

  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Using a 3-button Mouse.&nbsp; </span>The
one-button mouse on the Mac can be used in <code>3dmod</code> with
some keyboard modifiers, but this is painful.&nbsp; Just get a 3-button
mouse.&nbsp; It may just work when you plug it in, so try it in <code>3dmod</code>
before installing drivers.&nbsp; Installing Logitech and some other

  <h4>Setting Up a Windows PC to Run IMOD</h4>
For complete IMOD functionality
under Windows, including the ability to run
shell scripts and to build tomograms, you need to install a Unix-like
environment called <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>.
&nbsp;We have provided a <a
 href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/windows/cygwinForIMOD0108.exe">Cygwin
package</a> (from January, 2008) to make this process simpler and more
predictable.
&nbsp;This installation will occupy ~75 MB, all located under a single
directory that can be removed easily. &nbsp;The installation will also
create icons on the desktop and in the Start Menu, and make several
simple entries to the Windows registry.&nbsp; To satisfy the terms
of the Cygwin open source license, we also provide the <a
 href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/openSource/cygwinSource0108.zip">
source code</a>
matching the binaries in our package.<br>
  <br>
This package includes a superior
terminal window called <code>rxvt</code>&nbsp;and a lightweight text
editor, <code>nano</code>&nbsp;(derived from <code>pico</code>&nbsp;and
similar
to the editor in the <code>pine</code>&nbsp;email program).&nbsp;You
can
upgrade a previous Cygwin installation using this package, using the
same procedure as described below.<br>
  <br>
Cygwin installation may work best if you are logged in as a user with
Administrative privileges.<br>
  <br>
To install or upgrade Cygwin from the package in <code>cygwinForIMOD.exe</code>:<br>
  <br>
  <ol>
    <li>Click on the package to extract it. Press "Browse" and select
a folder to unzip to that is conveniently accessed (the Desktop will
do). &nbsp;You will get the <code>setup.exe</code> program and a <code>cygwinMaster</code>&nbsp;
folder with all the packages.</li>
    <li>Click on <code>setup.exe</code></li>
    <li>Select install from a Local Directory</li>
    <li>Set the root drive to <code>C:\cygwin</code> unless you want
it
on a different disk. Do not install under a directory with spaces in
its name. In the rest of this document, C:\ is used in the examples,
and you need to substitute your location if it is different.<br>
Take the defaults for the other two selections: install for all users
and Unix line endings.</li>
    <li>Select the <code>cygwinMaster</code> folder as the Local
Package Directory</li>
    <li>On the Select Packages page, click on the circular double arrow
next to "All" to switch from "Default" to "Install"</li>
    <li>Proceed with the installation, and take the defaults to create
icons on the desktop and start menu.</li>
  </ol>
  <br>
The installation will create a Unix-like directory tree under <code>C:\cygwin</code>.&nbsp;Terminal
windows and Cygwin programs such as the Unix tools will
display and work with paths that are relative to the Cygwin
installation.&nbsp;For example, if you have installed Cygwin in <code>C:\cygwin</code>&nbsp;
then the <code>/usr/local/IMOD</code>&nbsp;directory will exist in the
windows file systems as <code>C:\cygwin\usr\local\IMOD</code>.<br>
  <br>
After installation you will get an icon that
will
start up a shell under bash.&nbsp;The first time that you run this, a
home directory is created in&nbsp;<code>/home</code>&nbsp;(<code>C:\cygwin\home</code>)
and some bash
startup files are copied there.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Vista notes:</span> Some
problems will be encountered in Vista.
  <ol>
    <li> The icon
may not show up right after installation.&nbsp; Either log out and log
back in, or use Start - Programs - Cygwin - Bash shell to start a
terminal window.&nbsp; </li>
    <li> The first time, it will probably fail to
create a home directory, fail to copy startup files, and give a message
about running <code>mkpasswd</code> and <code>mkgroup</code>.&nbsp;
Do what it says, i.e. run<br>
      <code>mkpasswd -l &gt; /etc/passwd</code><br>
      <code>mkgroup -l &gt; /etc/group<br>
      </code> </li>
    <li> Then close the window and start a new terminal window; it will
create the home directory and copy files correctly.&nbsp; </li>
    <li> To have
the regular Cygwin shortcut or the <code>rxvt</code> one appear with
the traditional Cygwin icon, right-click on the shortcut to edit its
properties, and press the button to change the icon to select the
Cygwin icon. </li>
  </ol>
  <br>
The primary advantage of the <code>rxvt<span
 style="font-family: sans-serif;"> </span></code>window is that you
can
copy and paste just like under Unix (highlight with left mouse button,
paste with middle mouse button). This capability uses the Windows
clipboard, so you can copy text in a Windows program (Ctrl-C) and paste
with the mouse in the <code>rxvt </code>window, or highlight in the <code>rxvt
  </code>window
and paste in a Windows program with Ctrl-V.&nbsp;Another
advantage is that you can resize the <code>rxvt</code>&nbsp;window
horizontally as well as vertically.&nbsp;The <code>cygwinMaster </code>folder
contains two shortcuts and a configuration file that make it
easy to use <code>rxvt.</code>&nbsp;To use rxvt:<br>
  <ol>
    <li>Copy one of <code>Cygwin-bash.lnk</code> or <code>Cygwin-tcsh.lnk</code>
from <code>cygwinMaster</code> to your desktop, depending on your
preferred shell.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Copy <code>rxvt.Xdefaults</code> from <code>cygwinMaster</code>
to your Cygwin home directory.</li>
    <li>In a Cygwin window, rename <code>rxvt.Xdefaults</code> to <code>.Xdefaults</code>
(you cannot do this in Windows Explorer).&nbsp; <br>
    </li>
    <li>Click on the shortcut that you copied to get an rxvt
window.&nbsp; You can edit <code>.Xdefaults</code> to adjust the font
size and default window size and location.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Delete the existing Cygwin shortcut on your desktop and rename
the <code>Cygwin-bash</code> or <code>Cygwin-tcsh</code> shortcut to <code>Cygwin.</code></li>
    <li>If there are other users of Cygwin on your system, copy the
shortcuts and <code>rxvt.Xdefaults</code> from the <code>cygwinMaster</code>
folder
to some other place where the users can access them (such as <code>/usr/local</code>).<br>
    </li>
  </ol>
If you want to customize your Cygwin installation instead of using our
package, go to <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">www.cygwin.com</a>,
click on "Setup", and follow the installation procedures. &nbsp;<span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">In addition to the
default installation, it is essential that you select </span><code
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">tcsh</code><span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> from the Shells
category</span>.&nbsp; Be aware that changes in Cygwin periodically
break
something in IMOD.&nbsp; We try to keep up with these problems and
release updated packages of the current release version of IMOD, but it
is safer to use the package that we provide if it is adequate.<br>
  <br>
  <a name="InstallingWindows">
  <h4>Installing IMOD on a Windows PC</h4>
  </a>The self-installing package will install IMOD in /usr/local and
copy <code>IMOD-cygwin.sh</code>&nbsp;and <code>IMOD-cygwin.csh</code>&nbsp;to
  <code>/etc/profile.d</code>. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">It will not work by
clicking on it, only
by executing it from the command line.</span>&nbsp; To
install IMOD, start a Cygwin terminal window, change to the
directory where the package is located, and enter, e.g.:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>csh imod_3.11.2_win.csh<br>
  </code><br>
  <ol>
  </ol>
You will have to open a new Cygwin window for the installation to take
effect. <br>
  <br>
After installation, everything can be run from a Cygwin
window. &nbsp;In order to run eTomo, you also need to have Java
installed and
define some environment variables inside Windows:<br>
  <br>
  <ol>
    <li>If you do not already have Java (many machines do now), get the
latest Java Run-time Environment from <a href="http://www.sun.com">Sun</a>
or use the version provided <a
 href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/java/jre-1_5_0_06-windows-i586-p.exe">here</a>
.</li>
    <li> Click on the file and take the defaults to install Java. When
you are done, you can delete any Java icons from your desktop.</li>
    <li> To define environment variables, right click My Computer,
select Properties, Advanced, Environment Variables. Define all of these
paths in Windows format as illustrated in the following steps. Press
"New" to define a variable.</li>
    <li>Under "System variables", define &nbsp;<code>IMOD_DIR</code>
&nbsp;to be &nbsp;<code>C:\cygwin\usr\local\IMOD</code></li>
    <li>Under "User variables for username", define <code>&nbsp;HOME</code>
&nbsp; to be &nbsp; <code>C:\cygwin\home\username</code></li>
    <li> You also need to add the Cygwin bin to the system path, e.g.,
under "System variables", select <code>PATH</code>, press "Edit", and
add <code>C:\cygwin\bin; </code>to the front of the path (the ";" is
a
separator).</li>
  </ol>
  <br>
Here are some optional steps:<br>
  <br>
If you installed to a drive other than C:, you should define&nbsp; <code>IMOD_DIR</code>
as an environment variable in Windows as described above, but with the
appropriate letter instead of C, so that <code>3dmod</code> will be
able to find help files if it is started by clicking on an icon.<br>
  <br>
You can add <code>C:\cygwin\usr\local\IMOD\bin</code>&nbsp;to the
Windows
path, in which case you will be able to run everything, including shell
scripts,
from a DOS window.<br>
  <br>
To get some command files with DOS line endings you can define an
environment variable <code>CYGWIN</code>&nbsp;to be&nbsp;<code>nobinmode</code>.
This will make command files from <code>Setupcombine</code>, but not
those from <code>Copytomocoms</code>, have DOS line endings.<br>
  <br>
If you want to be able to display and print Postscript graphs from the
Fortran graphics programs (e.g., <code>nda, mtk, mtoverlap</code>),
you
can install <a
 href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/windows/gs811w32.exe">ghostscript</a>&nbsp;and
  <a href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/windows/gsv45w32.exe">gsview</a>&nbsp;for
Windows.<br>
  <br>
The steps for manually installing from the tar file
instead are:<br>
  <ol>
    <li> Start a Cygwin terminal window. <br>
    </li>
    <li> Move your copy of the IMOD distribution to <code>/usr/local</code>
either from the command line or from an Explorer window, where the
location will appear as <code>C:\cygwin\usr\local</code>.</li>
    <li>Change directory to <code>/usr/local</code> and, if you have
an existing IMOD installed, rename it.<br>
      <code>cd /usr/local<br>
mv IMOD oldIMOD</code><br>
    </li>
    <li>&nbsp;Unpack the tar file, rename it to IMOD, and copy startup
files: <br>
      <code></code><code>tar -xzf imod_3.11.2.tar.gz </code><br>
      <code>mv imod_3.11.2 IMOD </code><br>
      <code>cp IMOD/IMOD-cygwin.* /etc/profile.d</code></li>
  </ol>
  <br>
Finally, if you do not want to install Cygwin, you can still
use most of the programs in
IMOD.&nbsp;In this case, get the <code>.tar.gz</code>&nbsp;distribution
instead of the self-installing distribution and use <a
 href="http://www.winzip.com">Winzip </a>to
unpack it somewhere, (e.g., <code>C:\Program Files</code>), rename the
top directory to IMOD, and add the <code>IMOD\bin</code> directory
(e.g., <code>C:\Program Files\IMOD\bin</code>) to your path in
Windows, as described
above. <a name="ImodCalib"></a>
  <h4>Using the ImodCalib directory</h4>
Several parts of IMOD look for data and configuration files in a
separate
location, pointed to by the environment variable IMOD_CALIB_DIR. These
files
include the <code>cpu.adoc</code> file for enabling parallel
processing,
distortion correction files, noise files for microscope CTF correction,
and
local startup files.
The default
value for IMOD_CALIB_DIR is <code>/usr/local/ImodCalib</code> on all
platforms, and it is set in the IMOD startup scripts if it is not
already
defined. We have designed this directory as a place for local files
that
should not be replaced when IMOD is upgraded.
Minimally, then, you may want to create this directory and place a <code>cpu.adoc</code>
there defining the number of processors on one or more
machines. In addition, the IMOD startup scripts will try to source
local
startup scripts in this directory: <code>IMOD-...csh</code> will
source <code>$IMOD_CALIB_DIR/IMOD.csh</code> and <code>IMOD-...sh</code>
will source <code>$IMOD_CALIB_DIR/IMOD.sh</code>. You can use these
startup
scripts for
customizations, such as redefining <code>IMOD_JAVADIR</code>, instead
of
modifying the startup scripts that come with IMOD and get replaced with
each
new version. However, if you are going to take advantage of this
mechanism
and want to redefine <code>IMOD_CALIB_DIR</code> to point to a
different
location, your startup must set this environment variable before
sourcing the
IMOD startup scripts.

  <h3>Getting Started</h3>
  </a></dt>
<dt>You will want to go through the <a href="3dmodguide.html">Introduction
to 3dmod</a> because <code>3dmod</code> is the central graphical tool
of
the IMOD package. Beyond this, your initial problem may be getting
data into a format usable by the IMOD programs. If you are having
problems getting your data into a format usable by IMOD contact us for
help. </dt>
<dl>
  <dd>
    <h4>The Image Data Format and File Conversion</h4>
All of the IMOD programs use the <a href="mrc_format.txt">MRC image
file format</a>. We have utility programs available for converting TIFF
files and raw data into the MRC file format.&nbsp; In
addition, <code>3dmod</code> can read some common formats like JPEG,
TIFF, PNG, and BMP; it recognizes several specialized image formats
(DigitalMicrograph, EM, Hanspeter Winkler's NFF, PIF files from Bsoft);
and it has a dialog
box and options for specifying how to read raw data.
    <p> Use the program <a href="man/tif2mrc.html">tif2mrc</a> to
convert a series of TIFF image files into a single MRC image file. The <code>tif2mrc</code>
program has an option for converting 24-bit color to 8-bit grayscale
images, and options for dealing with unsigned 16 bit images, which are
a
potential problem because the standard MRC format supports only signed
16-bit
images. The following example will create a MRC file from a list of
TIFF files (cell01.tif, cell02.tif ...). </p>
    <p><code> tif2mrc cell??.tif cell.mrc </code> </p>
    <p>See the <a href="man/tif2mrc.html">tif2mrc manual page</a>
for
more information on how to use <code>tif2mrc</code>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dd>If you already have a series of MRC files, with one image per
file, you can combine them into a single stack easily with the program
&nbsp;<a href="man/newstack.html">newstack</a>.&nbsp; For example, enter</dd>
  <dd><br>
  </dd>
  <dd><code>newstack cell*.mrc cell.st&nbsp;</code></dd>
  <dd><br>
  </dd>
  <dd>The program <a href="man/raw2mrc.html">raw2mrc</a> is used to
convert raw image data into the mrc format. This program can take a
file of 8, 16,or 32 bit integers, IEEE float values, or 24-bit RGB
triplets and convert them into an MRC image file. In MRC files, the
data start in the lower left hand corner of the image, with the data
stored in rows. To use <code>raw2mrc</code>, you need to know the
size of the images, the type of data, and the size of any header
information preceding the image. &nbsp;For example, if you have a set
of files (cell01.em, cell02.em, ...) with 1024 x 1024 images of signed
16-bit integers, and a header of 512 bytes, use:</dd>
  <dd><br>
  </dd>
  <dd><code>raw2mrc -t short -x 1024 -y 1024 -o 512 cell*.em cell.mrc</code><br>
  </dd>
  <dd>
    <p>If the data need to have their bytes swapped because they come
from a
machine with the opposite byte ordering (e.g. PPC Mac versus Intel),
use the
-s
option. &nbsp;If you do not know something about the image, such as
the header size or whether the data are unsigned or need swapping,
you may be able to figure it out just by trying different options for
data
types and swapping. &nbsp;If you do not know the header size, convert
one file without the -o option, load it into 3dmod, and try to see
where the image data start. If the final MRC image is upside down use
the -f option in the initial conversion or use the program <a
 href="man/clip.html">clip</a> to flip the image back.</p>
  </dd>
  <dd>
    <p>When <code>3dmod</code> is started with an image file that it
does not recognize, it brings up a dialog that allows you to specify
the image and header size and the data type.&nbsp; Alternatively, you
can specify these features with options at the command line, which
could be the most convenient way to experiment and find the right
values.&nbsp; For example, the files in the previous command could be
displayed with:</p>
  </dd>
  <dd>
    <p><code>3dmod -r 1024,1024,1 -H 512 -t 1 cell*.em</code><br>
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dd>
    <h4>The Model Format</h4>
    <p> If you already have a 3-D model and wish to view it within
the IMOD model viewing program, <code>3dmodv</code>, you will need to
convert the file into the IMOD format. See the IMOD model file
format <a href="asciispec.html">ASCII</a> and <a href="binspec.html">binary
specifications</a> if you wish to write your own conversion program.
Model files from the HVEM3D program can be converted to the IMOD
model format using the <a href="man/rec2imod.html">rec2imod</a>
program. </p>
    <p> The IMOD model format can be either binary or ASCII.
Currently
supported machines can all read and write binary model files
interchangeably, so the main use of the ASCII format would be to
access the data for analysis or conversion by other programs. To
convert a binary IMOD file (binary.imod) to an ASCII IMOD file
(ascii.imod) use the <a href="man/imodinfo.html">imodinfo</a> command
: </p>
    <p><code>imodinfo -a binary.imod &gt; ascii.imod</code> <br>
or <br>
    <code>imodinfo -a -f ascii.imod binary.imod</code> <br>
will both create an ASCII model file from the binary.imod model.&nbsp;
The ASCII format preserves many but not all possible features in the
model.&nbsp; It is moderately complex and may not be the most
convenient format to use for exporting or importing data.&nbsp; There
are also two programs,&nbsp;<a href="man/model2point.html">model2point</a>
and&nbsp;<a href="man/point2model.html">point2model</a>, that can be
used to convert an IMOD model to or from a simple list of point
coordinates.<br>

  <hr> <a name="AligningImages">
  <h3>Aligning Serial Images</h3>
  </a> </dt>
Sometimes images in a data set are not in register with one another.
When this happens, a series of transforms will need to be found that
will align the whole stack of images. This series of transformations
is obtained in two stages. First, each successive pair of images is
considered separately, and a transform is found that aligns the
images when applied to the second image in the pair. This procedure
yields a list of transforms that align each image to the previous
image; the programs consistently refer to this as a list of "f"
transforms. If you think about it, you will realize that simply
applying these f transforms to all of the images in the stack will not
help, because each section would be aligned to the previous one only if
that previous one were not itself transformed. A second stage is thus
necessary: one must obtain the transforms for each image that will
produce an aligned stack when actually applied to the images. This list
is consistently referred to as a list of "g" transforms. In summary,
"f" transforms align each section to the preceding one; "g" transforms
align each section to the whole stack.<br>
<br>
The procedures described here are appropriate for aligning images of
successive slices through a structure, but not for aligning tilt series
images for tomography.&nbsp; The latter operation is done with the <code>eTomo</code>
program.&nbsp; Conversely, the tilt series alignment procedures there
cannot be use d<br>
<p>There are three general methods for obtaining alignment
transforms:
manual adjustment of transformation parameters, solving for a transform
from a set of fiducial points that correspond between two sections, and
automated search for the best fit between two images. </p>

  <dd> <a name="AutomaticAlignment"> </a>
    <h4>Automatic Image Alignment</h4>
Several programs are used for
automated image alignment. The programs used are <a
 href="man/xfalign.html">xfalign</a>, <a href="man/xftoxg.html">xftoxg</a>,<a
 href="man/midas.html"> midas</a> and <a href="man/newstack.html">newstack</a>.
Xfalign is a csh script that generates a "f" transform list using the <a
 href="man/xfsimplex.html">xfsimplex</a> program. It can prefilter
images using the <a href="man/enhance.html">enhance</a> program. It
also
has an option to get an initial alignment of the images by
cross-correlation, in case images are not already roughly aligned.
    <p>Steps and programs used in automatic image alignment: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a "f" transform list by using the xfalign program.<br>
        <code>xfalign cell.mrc cell.xf</code><br>
Expect the alignment for each section to take several seconds
to compute. The file, cell.xf, will contain information on how to align
adjacent images to one another. </li>
      <li>The next step is to analyze the the file cell.xf and the
transforms needed to bring all of the images in alignment with on
another. Use<code></code> <a href="man/xftoxg.html">xftoxg</a> to
create a global "g"
transform list from the "f" transform list:
        <p> <code> xftoxg cell.xf </code> </p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li>The output file from that command, cell.xg, should contain
all of the information needed to make new aligned images from the old
unaligned images. Use the <a href="man/newstack.html">newstack</a>
program to create the new aligned images. The
following example will create an aligned file newcell.mrc from the
old cell.mrc image file.
        <p><code> newstack -xform test.xg test.mrc newtest.mrc </code>
        </p>
        <p> If the automatic alignment is not always correct, it can
be
adjusted with the <a href="man/midas.html">midas</a> program. Start
the
program with: </p>
        <p><code> midas test.mrc test.xf </code> </p>
        <p>A window will open up and you can view the alignment
between
any given pair of adjacent images. After making adjustments for any
sections that are out of alignment, save the transforms and exit the
program. Then rerun the <code>xftoxg</code> and <code>newstack</code>
commands shown above. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that <a href="man/newstack.html"><code>newstack</code></a>
and some of the other programs will not work with 24-bit color
images.&nbsp; Use the "-g" option to <a href="man/tif2mrc.html"><code>tif2mrc</code></a>
to convert to gray scale when making the MRC stack.&nbsp; If you do
need to preserve the color information, then you can split the color
into three separate byte-mode files with the&nbsp; <code><a
 href="man/clip.html">clip</a></code> program, determine the alignment
with one color channel, apply the trasnformations to each of the 3
files separately, then merge the data again with <code><a
 href="man/clip.html">clip</a>.<br>
    </code><br>

  <p> Use the <a href="man/imodinfo.html">imodinfo</a> command to
get
basic information from a model and print it out to a terminal or file.
For example:</p>
  <p> <code> imodinfo cell.imod </code> </p>
  <pre># MODEL cell.imod<br># NAME  A little cell<br># PIX SCALE:  x = 1<br>#             y = 1<br>#             z = 9.17<br># PIX SIZE      = 0.00654<br># UNITS: um<br><br>OBJECT 1<br>NAME:  spindle pole<br>       5 contours<br>       object uses closed contours.<br>       color (red, green, blue) = (0, 1, 1)<br><br>       	CONTOUR #1,2,0  16 points, length = 0.464513,  area = 0.0134249<br>        CONTOUR #2,2,0  14 points, length = 0.458311,  area = 0.0125642<br>        CONTOUR #3,2,0  8 points,  length = 0.200755,  area = 0.00277481<br>        CONTOUR #4,2,0  13 points, length = 0.313501,  area = 0.00664029<br>        CONTOUR #5,2,0  9 points,  length = 0.232374,  area = 0.00272134<br><br>        Total volume = 0.00228646<br>        Total contour cylinder surface area = 0.10012.<br>        Total mesh surface area = 0.0349499.<br></pre>

  <h3>Output to Other Model Formats</h3>
  </a>IMOD models can be converted to a few other 3rd party formats.
The formats and the programs used to convert to them are listed
below.
  <ul>
    <li><a href="man/imod2vrml.html">imod2vrml</a> converts to the
Virtual Reality Modeling Language 1.0, see the <a
 href="http://www.web3d.org/vrml/vrml.htm">VRML Repository</a> for more
information.&nbsp;<br>
    </li>
    <li><a href="man/imod2rib.html">imod2rib</a> converts to the RIB
format used by Renderman. There is a set of public domain rendering
tools at the <a href="http://www.bmrt.org"> Blue Moon Rendering Tools</a>
Home Page. <br>
