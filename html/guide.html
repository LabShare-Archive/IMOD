			<h2>1. Installation</h2>
		</a>
		<p>All of the IMOD programs are available via the <a href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/download.html">
				IMOD Download Page</a>. &nbsp;The distribution is bundled together using 
			the tar program with gzip compression, then placed in a file after a C shell 
			script that can extract and install the programs.&nbsp; If you are willing to 
			install to the default location in the system and set up the IMOD environment 
			for all users in the default way, then you can install simply by running this 
			script, e.g.,<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>csh -f imod_4.7.1_RHEL6.csh</code><br>
			<br>
			(In this guide, the specific filenames are used as an example; your copy may 
			have higher version numbers.)
			<span style="COLOR: rgb(255,0,0)">You cannot click on the .csh file to
install it.</span>&nbsp; This command will not work on Windows unless the
      Cygwin toolkit is installed.  There is an executable installer for Windows
      with extension .exe that you can click on to install (either with or
      without Cygwin).&nbsp; If you have followed
      our recommended installation 
			procedures since IMOD 3.0.8, you will be able to upgrade using the same 
			command. If you want to install to a location other than the default,&nbsp; you 
			can specify the desired location inside of which the IMOD directory will be 
			placed, e.g.,<br>
			<code>&nbsp; csh -f imod_4.7.1_RHEL6.csh -dir /opt</code><br>
			<br>
			Older versions will be renamed, and at the end the installation script will 
			offer to remove them for you.&nbsp; People with special requirements not 
			anticipated by the install script may need to work with the tar file 
			instead.&nbsp; It can be extracted with:<br>
			&nbsp; <code>&nbsp;csh -f imod_4.7.1_RHEL6.csh -extract </code>
		</p>
		<p>
			The gzipped tar file and the install script will be left in a subdirectory 
			named <code>IMODtempDir.</code>&nbsp; There are several other useful options: <code>
				-script </code>to install startup scripts to a different location, <code>-skip</code>
			to skip installing startup scripts, <code>-name</code> to have the IMOD 
			directory be renamed to the given name.&nbsp; Use:<br>
			<code>&nbsp; csh -f imod_4.7.1_RHEL6.csh -help<br>
			</code>
			<br>
			to see all available options.&nbsp; The sections below on individual machine 
			types describe what will be done by the default installation procedure.&nbsp; 
			They also list the steps for doing a manual installation instead of using the 
			self-installing package, but this should rarely be needed. <a name="SettingUpLinux">
			</a>
			<h3>1.1. Setting Up a Linux PC to Run IMOD.</h3>
		<P>The recommended configuration for running the IMOD software is:
		</P>
		<P>
			Processor: Almost any Intel or AMD processor from the last few years, or 
			medium- to high-end processors from the last 5 years, will run adequately<br>
			Video Card: any relatively modern Nvidia card (GeForce or Quadro, 256 MB or 
			higher cards preferred)<br>
			Minimum memory size: 2 GB
			<br>
			Minimum disk size: 50 GB
			<br>
			Operating System: Red Hat Workstation 5 or Fedora 6 or higher<br>
			Recent Nvidia Linux device drivers and OpenGL libraries from <a href="http://www.nvidia.com">
				Nvidia</a>
		</P>
		<P><b>Nvidia installation.</b> Installing Nvidia drivers is now
			straightforward on some systems, 
			but here are some <a href="nvidia_install.txt">instructions</a> that may be 
			helpful for older Fedora (up to 16 or so) and Red Hat/Centos through
			version 6. &nbsp;The latest versions of the drivers change the Driver line in 
			/etc/X11/xorg.conf from "nv" to "nvidia" if you accept their offer to modify 
			the file. &nbsp;For recent Fedora, search for "Install NVIDIA drivers
			Fedora xx", where xx is your version number, and study the
			various instructions that you find.
			&nbsp;On Ubuntu, the automatic installation through Synaptic Package 
			Manager or its current equivalent should be adequate.  However, on
			laptops, it is important to know whether the NVIDIA card has Optimus
			technology for switching between the card and built-in graphics.  If it
			does, the regular methods will probably not work, but one solution is to
			install bumblebee (search on bumblebee and the Linux distribution name
			for specific instructions).  Bumblebee allows you to direct a program
			to access the NVIDIA graphics by starting it with a 
			the <code>optirun</code> command.  Thus, if you simply start a new 
			shell, e.g., with <code>optirun bash</code> and run IMOD commands from
			this shell, you should find that 
			3dmod uses the NVIDIA graphics and that the GPU is available for reconstruction.
		</P>
		<p><b>Window manager settings.</b> To keep 3dmod from bogging down when it is 
			displaying complex models, some window managers can be set to display only the 
			outline and not the contents of windows when they are moved or resized.&nbsp; 
			This cannot be done under Gnome but it can generally be done under KDE if you 
			can find the "Window Behavior" control panel. For example, on RHEL5 you can run <code>
				kcontrol</code> at the command line to open the Control Center and 
			selecting "Look and Feel" or "Desktop" (depending on KDE version), then "Window 
			Behavior" then the "Moving" tab.&nbsp; On Fedora 11, open System Settings from 
			the main menu, select "Look and Feel" and "Window Behavior" and "Window 
			Behavior" again, then the "Moving" tab.&nbsp; Also, on the "Advanced" tab you 
			should turn off "Hide utility windows for inactive applications" to keep 
			undocked toolbars in 3dmod from disappearing.&nbsp; Both <code>3dmod</code> and <code>
				eTomo</code> have problems under Compiz, so you should disable this.&nbsp; 
			On older Ubuntu, open the menu entry System - Preferences - Visual Effects and 
			select "No effects".
		</p>
		<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">tcsh and libjpeg62 for Ubuntu.</span>
			You must install <code>tcsh </code>even if you also have <code>csh </code>installed.&nbsp; 
			Things should work with both installed, but it would be safer to have only <code>tcsh</code>.&nbsp; 
			You can install <code>tcsh </code>through the Synaptic Package Manager or 
			Ubuntu Software Manager or with:<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>sudo apt-get install tcsh</code>
    <br>You will also need version 6.2 of the JPEG libraries, which is not
    present on newer systems.  The sign of needing this is an error message
    when trying run 3dmod or some other programs: <I>error while loading shared
    libraries: libjpeg.so.62: cannot open shared object file: No such file or
    directory</I>.  Before this, you should see a warning when you install
    IMOD.  Install the older JPEG library with:<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>sudo apt-get install libjpeg62</code>
    </p>
		<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">tcsh and libpng12 for Fedora.</span>
      The standard Fedora install no longer includes <code>tcsh</code>, so
      you must install it before trying to install IMOD, with:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; <code>sudo yum install tcsh</code>
      <br>You will also need version 1.2 of the PNG libraries, which is not
      present on newer systems.  The sign of needing this is an error message
      when trying run 3dmod:
      <I>error while loading shared libraries: libpng12.so.0: cannot open
        shared object file: No such file or directory</I>.  Install a
      compatibility library with:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; <code>sudo yum install libpng12</code>
      </p>
		<a name="InstallingLinuxSGI">
			<h3>1.2. Installing IMOD on a Linux PC</h3>
		</a>
		<P>
			The self-installing package will install to a directory named <code>IMOD</code> 
			under <code>/usr/local</code> unless given an alternate location to <code>/usr/local</code>
			with the <code>-dir</code> option.&nbsp; It will copy the startup scripts <code>IMOD-linux.sh
			</code>and <code>IMOD-linux.csh </code>to <code>/etc/profile.d</code>. unless 
			given an alternate location with the <code>-script</code> option or told to 
			skip this step with the <code>-skip</code> option, or unless you are running 
			Ubuntu or give the <code>-debian</code> option.&nbsp; It the latter cases, it 
			will modify <code>/etc/bash.bashrc</code> and <code>/etc/csh.cshrc</code> to 
			source the startup scripts from the IMOD directory, unless you give the <code>-skip</code>
			option.&nbsp; To accomplish all of this, change directory to the place where 
			the package is located and enter, for example:<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>sudo csh </code><code>-f imod_4.7.1_RHEL6.csh<br>
			</code>
			<br>
			You will have to open a new window, or possibly even log out and log back in, 
			for the installation to take effect.
		</P>
		<P>If you are upgrading IMOD using the default procedures, and your previous 
			installation used another method for setting the environment variables for 
			users, be sure to remove whatever commands were used before. &nbsp;These might 
			have been placed in <code>/etc/cshrc</code>,<code> /usr/local/etc/cshrc</code>, 
			or users' <code>.cshrc</code>, <code>.bashrc</code>, or <code>.bash_profile</code>
			files.</P>
		<P>You would skip the installation of the startup scripts if you do not want a 
			system wide installation, or if you are installing to a server to be accessed 
			by multiple workstations. In this case, you would place the following in the <code>.cshrc</code>
			files of individual users of <code>tcsh</code> (where &lt;location of IMOD&gt; 
			is the absolute path to the IMOD directory):
		</P>
		<P><code>setenv IMOD_DIR &lt;location of IMOD&gt;</code><br>
			<code>if (-e $IMOD_DIR/IMOD-linux.csh) source $IMOD_DIR/IMOD-linux.csh </code>
		</P>
		<P>or, place the following in the <code>.bashrc </code>or <code>.bash_profile</code>
			of&nbsp; individual users under <code>bash</code>:
		</P>
		<P><code>export IMOD_DIR=&lt;location of IMOD&gt;</code><br>
			<code>if [ -e $IMOD_DIR/IMOD-linux.sh ] ; then source $IMOD_DIR/IMOD-linux.sh ; fi</code>
		</P>
		<P>Alternatively, if there are system-wide startup scripts sourced from the users' <code>
				.cshrc</code> or <code>.basrc/.bash_profile</code>, you would place these 
			commands in the system-wide startup scripts.&nbsp; You should always source the 
			startup script that comes with an IMOD distribution, not make a copy of the 
			startup script and incorporate it into other scripts, because that is the 
			easiest way to adapt to changes in the startup script between versions.
		</P>
		<P>If you want to run programs temporarily in a particular version of IMOD without 
			replacing your installed version, unpack the desired version in some logical 
			place with a command like:<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code> csh -f imod_4.7.1_RHEL6.csh -dir 
				testIMOD -skip</code></P>
		<P>This will manage an installation of IMOD under the directory <code>testIMOD</code>, 
			offering to delete other versions there.&nbsp; To run with this IMOD, cd to <code>testIMOD/IMOD</code>
			and enter:
		</P>
		<P>
			<code>&nbsp;&nbsp; setenv IMOD_DIR `pwd`</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (under tcsh, 
			or)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>export IMOD_DIR=`pwd`&nbsp;&nbsp; </code>
			(under bash)<br>
			<code>&nbsp;&nbsp; source IMOD-linux.csh</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (under tcsh, 
			or)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>source
			IMOD-linux.sh&nbsp;&nbsp; </code>(under bash)</P>
		<p><b>Manual Install. </b>&nbsp;To install manually from the tar file, do the 
			following steps after running the self-installing file with the <code>-extract</code>
			option:
		</p>
		<OL>
			<LI>
			Log in as root or do all of these commands with sudo
			<LI>
				cd to the directory where you downloaded IMOD, and
				<br>
				&nbsp;<code> mv imod_4.7.1_RHEL6.tar.gz /usr/local</code>
			<LI>
				&nbsp;<code> cd /usr/local</code>&nbsp;
			<LI>
				&nbsp;<code> tar -xzf imod_4.7.1_RHEL6.tar.gz</code>
			<LI>
				To see if you already have a /usr/local/IMOD,
				<br>
				<code>&nbsp; ls -l</code>
			<LI>
				If you do have a /usr/local/IMOD and it is a link (e.g., it shows up as <code>IMOD 
					-&gt; imod_2.7.6</code>), then enter
				<br>
				<code>&nbsp; rm IMOD</code>
				<br>
				Otherwise, rename the existing directory, e.g.:
				<br>
				<code>&nbsp; mv IMOD oldIMOD</code>
			<li>
				&nbsp;<code> ln -s imod_4.7.1 IMOD</code>
			<li>
				Except on Ubuntu and other Debian systems,<br>
				<code>&nbsp; cp IMOD/IMOD-linux.* /etc/profile.d</code> <code></code>
			</li>
		</OL>
		<P>On Ubuntu when installing manually, instead of step 8, you would insert commands 
			into <code>/etc/csh.cshrc</code> and <code>/etc/bash.bashrc</code> just like 
			those given above for inserting in users' <code>.cshrc</code> and <code>.bash_profile</code>
			files, respectively.&nbsp;

			<h3>1.3. Installing Java on a Linux PC
			</h3>
			<P>
		</a>Etomo is a Java application and thus requires a Java runtime environment 
		(JRE) with a version of 1.6 or better to be installed.&nbsp; Recent Fedora and 
		RedHat-based systems have had usable native Java packages available or 
		installed.&nbsp; Check your system with<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>&nbsp;java -version</code><br>
		If you see Java(TM) (as on RHEL5 and RHEL6) or OpenJDK (as on Centos 5 and 
		recent Fedora) then the installed java should work.&nbsp; Otherwise, you will 
		need to install a Sun/Oracle version.&nbsp; Sun/Oracle's JRE version 1.6.0_20 
		is available <a href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/java/jre-6u20-linux-i586.bin">here</a>&nbsp;for 
		32-bit Linux and <a href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/java/jre-6u20-linux-x64.bin">
			here</a> for 64-bit Linux.&nbsp;&nbsp;On most newer 64-bit systems you will 
		generally need a 64-bit version.&nbsp; </p>
		<p>On older versions of Ubuntu, the <code>sun-java6-jre</code> package available in 
			the Synaptic Package Manager seemed to work well, while <code>openjdk-6-jre</code>
			gave display problems. On Ubuntu 11, the <code>openjdk-6-jre</code> offered by 
			the Ubuntu Software Center seems to work well.</p>
		<P>If you are installing a 64-bit system, modify all the commands given next 
			appropriately.&nbsp; To install the JRE for Linux first move the <code>
				<span style="FONT-FAMILY: monospace">jre-6u20-linux-i586.bin</span></code> file 
			to <code>/usr/local</code>
			<br>
			<code>
				<span style="FONT-FAMILY: monospace">&nbsp;&nbsp; sudo
          mv </span></code><code><span style="FONT-FAMILY: monospace">jre-6u20-linux-i586.bin /usr/local</span></code><br></P>
    <p>Next change your working directory to <code>/usr/local</code> and&nbsp; execute 
	    the bin by entering<br>
	    <span style="FONT-FAMILY: monospace"><code>&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /usr/local</code><br>
        &nbsp;<code>&nbsp; sudo sh jre-6u20-linux-i586.bin</code></span></p>
    <p>on the command line. &nbsp;</p>
		<p>This will install the JRE in <code>/usr/local/jre1.6.0_20</code>. &nbsp;The IMOD 
			startup scripts will assume that the JRE is in <code>/usr/local/java</code> if 
			java is not on your command path, so next create a link:<br>
			<span style="FONT-FAMILY: monospace">
				<code>&nbsp;&nbsp; sudo ln -s jre1.6.0_20 java</code></span></p>
		<p>If you upgrade to a different JRE, then you just need to change the link. 
			&nbsp;If you wish to use a different JRE than the one pointed to by <code>/usr/local/java</code>, 
			you must&nbsp; redefine the environment variable IMOD_JAVADIR to specify the 
			directory where the JRE you wish to use is installed.&nbsp; The best way to do 
			this is to make files <code>IMOD.csh</code> and <code>IMOD.sh</code> in <code>/usr/local/ImodCalib</code>
			that set this environment variable, rather than modifying the <code>IMOD-linux.sh</code>
			and <code>IMOD-linux.csh</code> scripts in <code>/etc/profile.d</code> (see&nbsp;<a href="#ImodCalib">Using 
				the ImodCalib Directory</a>).
		</p>
		<a name="InstallingMac">
			<h3>1.4. Installing IMOD on a Macintosh running OS X</h3></a>
		<P>
		  Be sure to install the right package for the processor type: <code>_osx_intel</code>
		for an Intel processor or <code>_osx_ppc</code> for a PowerPC (G4, G5, 
		etc).&nbsp; The self-installing package will install to /Applications or to an 
		alternate location with the <code>-dir</code> option.&nbsp;
		<span style="COLOR: rgb(255,0,0); FONT-WEIGHT: bold">It will
      not work by clicking on it, only by running it at the command
      line.</span>&nbsp; It will place appropriate "source" commands for defining the user 
		environment in <code>/etc/csh.login<span style="FONT-FAMILY:
                                                    sans-serif"></span></code>
    and
		<code>/etc/profile</code>.&nbsp;You need to be able to use sudo. &nbsp;Open a 
		terminal window (under Applications-Utilities), change directory to the place 
		where the package is located, and enter, e.g.:<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code> sudo csh -f imod_4.7.1_osx_intel64.csh</code><br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;You will need to exit and restart Terminal for these changes to take 
		effect, or you can just source <code>/etc/csh.login</code>&nbsp;(if you are 
		running tcsh) or <code>/etc/profile</code>&nbsp;(if you are running bash). If 
		you are upgrading IMOD with the default installation procedures and your 
		previous installation used another method of setting environment variables, 
		then you may need to remove "source" or other environment-setting commands from 
		various files, such as <code>/etc/csh.login</code>, <code>/etc/profile</code>, 
		or users' <code>.cshrc</code>, <code>.bashrc</code>, or <code>.profile</code>&nbsp;files.<br>
		<br>
		Once you have verified that IMOD programs run after installing them, you can 
		make some links in <code>/usr/lib</code> to libraries in the IMOD directories 
		that will allow you to start 3dmod by clicking on its icon. &nbsp;Run the <code>linklibs-mac
		</code>script by entering:<br>
		<code>&nbsp;&nbsp; sudo $IMOD_DIR/linklibs-mac -i</code>
    </P>
    <p>If this creates problems, such as conflicts with other programs that supply 
			their own Qt libraries, you can remove the links with:<br>
			<code>&nbsp;&nbsp; sudo $IMOD_DIR/linklibs-mac -u</code></p>
    <p>If you are upgrading IMOD and have done this before, you should run <code>$IMOD_DIR/linklibs-mac 
				-u </code>before installing the new version.</p>
		<p><b>Java for OS X 10.7 - 10.9.</b>&nbsp; Java is not installed by default in OS X 
			10.7 and above.&nbsp; The system will offer to install it for you the first time you run 
			a Java program.&nbsp; To check the status of Java and get it installed, in the 
			terminal, enter<br>
			<code>&nbsp;&nbsp; java -version</code></p>
		<p>
			<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Using a 3-button Mouse.&nbsp; </span>The 
			one-button mouse on the Mac can be used in <code>3dmod</code> with some 
			keyboard modifiers, but this is painful.&nbsp; Just get a 3-button mouse.&nbsp; 
			It may just work when you plug it in, so try it in <code>3dmod</code>
		before installing drivers.&nbsp; Installing Logitech and some other drivers may 
		actually make it stop working, and the solution is to uninstall the drivers.<p>
			<b>Manual Install.</b>&nbsp; To install manually from the tar file that you can 
			get by running the self-installing file with the <code>-extract</code> option, 
			you have two alternatives.&nbsp;To do it from the command line, open a Terminal 
			window and:
		</p>
		<OL>
			<LI>
				cd to the directory where you downloaded IMOD, and
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;<code> sudo mv imod_4.7.1_osx_intel64.tar.gz /Applications</code>
			<li>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;<code> cd /Applications</code>
			<li>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;<code> sudo tar xzf imod_4.7.1_osx_intel64.tar.gz</code>
			<li>
				To see if you already have a /Applications/IMOD,
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;<code> ls -l</code>
			<li>
				If you do have a /Applications/IMOD and it is a link (e.g., it shows up as <code>IMOD 
					-&gt; imod_3.1.6</code>), then enter
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;<code> sudo rm IMOD</code>
				<br>
				Otherwise, rename the existing directory, e.g.:
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;<code> sudo mv IMOD oldIMOD</code>
			<li>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;<code> sudo mv imod_4.7.1 IMOD</code></li></OL>
		<P>If you are on a single user-machine or have administrative privileges from the 
			desktop, you can use the following alternative approach:</P>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Click on the downloaded file to unpack it with Stuffit Expander and create the 
				IMOD folder, e.g. <code>imod_4.7.1</code>
			<li>
			Drag this folder into the /Applications folder.
			<li>
			If you already have an IMOD folder in /Applications, rename it or move it 
			elsewhere.
			<li>
				Rename the new distribution to IMOD.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Whichever approach you use, you need to add some startup commands to the system 
			files <code>/etc/csh.login </code>and <code>/etc/profile</code>, unless they 
			are already there from a previous installation of IMOD.&nbsp;Use sudo to invoke <code>
				emacs </code>or <code>pico</code>&nbsp;on these files, .e.g.:<br>
			<code>&nbsp;&nbsp; sudo emacs /etc/csh.login</code><br>
			&nbsp;Copy the text in <code>IMOD/mac.cshrc</code>&nbsp;to the end of <code>/etc/csh.login</code>, 
			specifically the command
			<br>
			<code>if (-e /Applications/IMOD/IMOD-mac.csh) source 
				/Applications/IMOD/IMOD-mac.csh<br>
				<br>
			</code>Similarly, copy the text in <code>IMOD/mac.bashrc</code>&nbsp;to the end 
			of <code>/etc/profile</code>, specifically the command
			<br>
			<code>[ -r /Applications/IMOD/IMOD-mac.sh ] &amp;&amp; source 
				/Applications/IMOD/IMOD-mac.sh</code><br>
			<br>
			If you want to install at another location, change <code>/Applications/IMOD</code>&nbsp;to 
			the name of the top IMOD directory in <code>IMOD-mac.csh<span style="FONT-FAMILY: sans-serif"></span></code>and
			<code>IMOD-mac.sh<span style="FONT-FAMILY: sans-serif"></span></code>and in the 
			source commands placed in <code>/etc/csh.login </code>and<code> /etc/profile. </code>
			If you are sure you are not going to install somewhere else in the future, you 
			can avoid modifying <code>IMOD-mac.csh</code> and <code>IMOD-mac.sh</code> by 
			defining IMOD_DIR before the source commands, i.e. with
			<br>
			<code>&nbsp;&nbsp; setenv IMOD_DIR &lt;Location_of_IMOD&gt;</code><br>

			<h3>1.5. Setting Up a Windows PC to Run IMOD with Cygwin</h3>
		</a>
    <p>To use IMOD effectively under Windows, 
	    you need to install either a Unix-like 
	    environment called <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> or an
			appropriate version of Python. &nbsp;The option of just installing
			Python is new for IMOD 4.7; everything in IMOD will work except a few
			specialized C-shell scripts, but subtomogram averaging with PEET will
	    not work without Cygwin.  If this is the route that you prefer, go
	    to <a href="#SettingUpNoCygwin"> Setting Up a Windows PC and Installing
			IMOD without Cygwin</a></p>
    <p>This section deals with installing Cygwin.  We have 
			provided both a <a href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/windows/cygwinForIMOD0310.exe">
				Cygwin package</a> and a <a href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/windows/cygwin_installer_0310.exe">
				Cygwin installer</a> (from March 2010) to make this process simpler and 
			more predictable.&nbsp; This installation will occupy ~100 MB, all located 
			under a single directory that can be removed easily.&nbsp; The installation 
			will also create icons on the desktop and in the Start Menu, and make several 
			simple entries to the Windows registry.&nbsp; To satisfy the terms of the 
			Cygwin open source license, we also provide the <a href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/openSource/cygwinSource0310.zip">
				source code</a> matching the binaries in our package.</p>
		<p>
			Installing Cygwin creates a Unix-like directory tree (including directories <code>bin</code>,
			<code>etc</code>, <code>usr</code>, and <code>home</code>) under its top 
			directory, which is <code>C:\cygwin</code> by default.&nbsp;Terminal windows 
			and Cygwin programs such as the Unix tools will display and work with Unix-type 
			paths that are relative to the top Cygwin directory.&nbsp; For example, if you 
			install Cygwin in <code>C:\cygwin</code>, then the location where IMOD will be 
			installed is referred to as <code>/usr/local/IMOD</code> from within Cygwin and 
			will exist in the Windows file systems as <code>C:\cygwin\usr\local\IMOD</code>.</p>
		<p>
			<span class="style1">The Cygwin that you use must include Python, which is now 
      required for building tomograms.</span>&nbsp; Our last two Cygwin packages have 
			included Python.&nbsp; If you use a current version of Cygwin from the Cygwin 
			website, you may need to make sure that there is a Python executable, <code>/bin/python.exe</code>, 
			recognizable to Windows (see below).</p>
		<p>
			Our Cygwin packages also include a superior terminal window called <code>mintty</code>
			and a lightweight text editor, <code>nano</code> (derived from <code>pico</code>
			and similar to the editor in the <code>pine</code> email program).&nbsp; We 
			used to include <code>rxvt</code> and have now switched to <code>mintty</code> because 
			it has a better interface and because <code>rxvt</code> is no longer supported 
			and has developed problems in this Cygwin release. The primary advantage of the <code>
				mintty</code> window is that you can copy and paste just like under Unix 
			(highlight with left mouse button, paste with middle mouse button).&nbsp; This 
			capability uses the Windows clipboard, so you can copy text in a Windows 
			program (Ctrl-C) and paste with the mouse in the <code>mintty </code>window, or 
			highlight in the <code>mintty </code>window and paste in a Windows program with 
			Ctrl-V.&nbsp; Another advantage is that you can resize the <code>mintty</code> window 
			horizontally as well as vertically.</p>
		<p>
			Cygwin installation will work best if you are logged in as a user with 
			Administrative privileges.</p>
		<p>
			Use our <a href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/windows/cygwin_installer_0310.exe">installer</a>
			for a fresh installation of Cygwin. &nbsp;It performs all the steps described 
			below. &nbsp;Simply click on it; it will unpack itself and launch the Cygwin 
			setup program as well as show a page with some instructions. &nbsp;Note the 
			following points:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Ignore the alarming warning about the change in mounting conventions and the 
			advice to read the Cygwin user's manual.
			<li>
			For the most part, you just accept the defaults in Cygwin setup. &nbsp;The 
			instructions illustrate the one tricky step that is needed to get everything 
			installed from the package.
			<li>
				You are free to change the drive letter under which it will be installed, but 
				you should keep <code>cygwin</code>
			as the directory name.
			<li>
				After components are installed, you can uncheck the box for an icon on the 
				desktop, because our installer will create desktop shortcuts for starting a <code>mintty</code>
				window running either a <code>bash</code> or a <code>tcsh</code>
			shell.
			<li>
				Our installer also takes care of copying shell startup files to your Cygwin 
				home directory. &nbsp;It places a file named <code>.minttyrc</code> there that 
				will give good starting properties for a <code>mintty</code>
			window.
			<li>
				Copies of the two shortcuts and of <code>.minttyrc</code> will also be left in 
				/usr/local for other users to copy.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			In order to run eTomo, you also need to have Java installed.&nbsp; If you do 
			not already have Java (most machines do now), get the latest Java Run-time 
			Environment from <a href="http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp">Java
			download site</a>.&nbsp; Click on the file and take the defaults to install Java. 
			When you are done, you can delete any Java icons from your desktop.</p>
		<p>
			You can use our simpler <a href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/windows/cygwinForIMOD0310.exe">
				Cygwin package</a> instead to install Cygwin, but then you would have to do 
			all the steps described below yourself. &nbsp;You can also use this package to 
			upgrade a previous Cygwin installation. &nbsp;The rest of this section has 
			steps for installing or upgrading Cygwin from this package:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Click on the package to extract it. Press "Browse" and select a folder to unzip 
				to that is conveniently accessed (the Desktop will do). &nbsp;You will get the <code>
					setup.exe</code> program and a <code>cygwinMaster</code>
			folder with all the packages.
			<li>
				Click on <code>setup.exe</code>
			<li>
			Select install from a Local Directory
			<li>
				Set the root drive to <code>C:\cygwin</code> unless you want it on a different 
				disk.&nbsp; Do not install under a directory with spaces in its name.&nbsp; In 
				the rest of this document, C:\ is used in the examples, and you need to 
				substitute your location if it is different.<br>
			Take the default for the other selection: install for all users.
			<li>
				Select the <code>cygwinMaster</code>
			folder as the Local Package Directory
			<li>
			On the Select Packages page, click on the circular double arrow next to "All" 
			to switch from "Default" to "Install"
			<li>
				Proceed with the installation, and take the defaults to create icons on the 
				desktop and start menu.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			After installation you will get an icon that will start up a shell under 
			bash.&nbsp;The first time that you run this, a home directory is created 
			in&nbsp;<code>/home</code> (<code>C:\cygwin\home</code>) and some bash startup 
			files are copied there.</p>
		<p>
			The <code>cygwinMaster </code>folder contains two shortcuts and a configuration 
			file that make it easy to use <code>mintty.</code> To use mintty:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Copy one of <code>Cygwin-bash.lnk</code> or <code>Cygwin-tcsh.lnk</code> from <code>
					cygwinMaster</code>
			to your desktop, depending on your preferred shell.
			<li>
				Copy <code>minttyrc</code> from <code>cygwinMaster</code>
			to your Cygwin home directory.
			<li>
				In a Cygwin window, rename <code>minttyrc</code> to <code>.minttyrc</code> with 
				the command <code>mv minttyrc .minttyrc</code>
			(you cannot do this in Windows Explorer).&nbsp;
			<li>
				Click on the shortcut that you copied to get a <code>mintty</code> window.&nbsp; 
				You can right-click in the title bar of the window and select <b>Options</b>
			to get a dialog for adjusting font size and style, colors, default window size, 
			etc..
			<li>
				Delete the existing Cygwin shortcut on your desktop and rename the <code>Cygwin-bash</code>
				or <code>Cygwin-tcsh</code> shortcut to <code>Cygwin.</code>
			<li>
				If there are other users of Cygwin on your system, copy the shortcuts and <code>minttyrc</code>
				from the <code>cygwinMaster</code> folder to some other place where the users 
				can access them (such as <code>/usr/local</code>).
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>If you want to customize your Cygwin installation instead of using our package, 
			go to <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">www.cygwin.com</a>, click on "Setup", and 
			follow the installation procedures. &nbsp;<span style="COLOR: rgb(255,0,0); FONT-WEIGHT: bold">In addition to the
default installation, it is essential that you select </span><code style="COLOR: rgb(255,0,0); FONT-WEIGHT: bold">tcsh</code><span style="COLOR: rgb(255,0,0); FONT-WEIGHT: bold"> from the Shells
category and 
</span><code style="COLOR: rgb(255,0,0); FONT-WEIGHT: bold">python</code><span style="COLOR: rgb(255,0,0); FONT-WEIGHT: bold"> from the 
Python category.&nbsp; In addition, there must be a Python executable named
        <code>/bin/python.exe</code>, not 
        just a Cygwin link to an executable</span>.&nbsp; The IMOD installer will take care 
			of creating such an executable, but if you upgrade Cygwin without re-installing 
			IMOD, you should do the following:<ol>
				<li>
					In a terminal window, enter
					<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>ls /bin/python*</code>
					<br>
					to see if there is a <code>python.exe</code>
				<li>
					If there is not, copy <code>python2.7.exe</code> (or whatever numbered 
					executable shows up in the listing) with<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>cp /bin/python2.7.exe /bin/python.exe</code></li>
			</ol>
      If you upgrade Cygwin and you DO reinstall IMOD, it will fail if there is
      an old <code>python.exe</code> from Python 2.6.  In that case, you can
      just remove <code>python.exe</code> and run the installer again, or you
      can do the copy just described.
			<a name="InstallingWindows">
				<h3>1.6. Installing IMOD on a Windows PC with Cygwin</h3>
			</a>
		<p>For Windows, we provide an executable installer that works by clicking on it, 
			installs IMOD in <code>/usr/local</code>, copies the startup scripts <code>IMOD-cygwin.sh</code>
			and <code>IMOD-cygwin.csh</code> to <code>/etc/profile.d</code>, and takes care 
			of putting Cygwin on the system path and setting the environment variables <code>IMOD_DIR</code>
			and <code>HOME</code> as described below. Old versions of IMOD are 
			automatically deleted.&nbsp; If you need something besides this behavior, you 
			can still run a self-installing package (e.g., a <code>csh</code> file like <code>imod_4.7.1_win.csh</code>) 
			at the command line, as described below.
		</p>
		<p>
			To use the installer, just click on it and press buttons to confirm each 
			step.&nbsp; There are no choices to make.&nbsp; Open a new Cygwin window and 
			you should be able to run IMOD programs.</p>
		<p>Here are some optional steps, whichever way you install IMOD:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				You can add the location of the IMOD <code>bin</code> directory (e.g., <code>C:\cygwin\usr\local\IMOD\bin</code>) 
			to the Windows path, in which case you will be able to run everything, 
			including shell scripts, from a DOS window.
			<li>
				If you want to be able to display and print Postscript graphs from the Fortran 
				graphics programs (e.g., <code>nda, mtk, mtoverlap</code>), you can install <a href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/windows/gs811w32.exe">
					ghostscript</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/windows/gsv45w32.exe">
					gsview</a>&nbsp;for Windows.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			The rest of this section describes other ways of installing IMOD. If you run a 
			self-installing package at the command line instead (with filename ending in <code>.csh</code>), 
			it will install IMOD in /usr/local and copy <code>IMOD-cygwin.sh</code> and <code>IMOD-cygwin.csh</code>
			to <code>/etc/profile.d</code>, unless given options telling it to do something 
			else.
			<span style="COLOR: rgb(255,0,0); FONT-WEIGHT: bold">It will not work by
clicking on it, only
by executing it from the command line.</span>&nbsp; To install or upgrade IMOD this way, 
			start a Cygwin terminal window, change to the directory where the package is 
			located, and enter, e.g.:<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>csh -f imod_4.7.1_win.csh</code></p>
		<p>
			You will have to open a new Cygwin window for a new installation to take 
			effect.
		</p>
		<p>
			After installation, everything can be run from a Cygwin window. &nbsp;In order 
			to run eTomo, you also need to define some environment variables inside 
			Windows:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			Right click My Computer, select Properties, Advanced, Environment Variables. 
			Define all of these paths in Windows format as illustrated in the following 
			steps. Press "New" to define a variable.
			<li>
				Under "System variables", define <code>IMOD_DIR</code> to be <code>C:\cygwin\usr\local\IMOD</code>
			<li>
				Under "User variables for username", define <code>HOME</code> to be <code>C:\cygwin\home\username</code>
			<li>
				You also need to add the Cygwin bin to the system path, e.g., under "System 
				variables", select <code>PATH</code>, press "Edit", and add <code>C:\cygwin\bin; </code>
				to the front of the path (the ";" is a separator).</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Even if you are not running eTomo, if you installed to a drive other than C:, 
			you should define&nbsp; <code>IMOD_DIR</code> as an environment variable in 
			Windows as described above, but with the appropriate letter instead of C, so 
			that <code>3dmod</code> will be able to find help files if it is started by 
			clicking on an icon.</p>
		<p>
			The steps for manually installing from the tar file instead are:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			Start a Cygwin terminal window.
			<li>
				Move your copy of the IMOD distribution to <code>/usr/local</code> either from 
				the command line or from an Explorer window, where the location will appear as <code>
					C:\cygwin\usr\local</code>.
			<li>
				Change directory to <code>/usr/local</code> and, if you have an existing IMOD 
				installed, rename it.<br>
				<code>&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /usr/local<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp; mv IMOD oldIMOD</code><li>
				&nbsp;Unpack the tar file, rename it to IMOD, and copy startup files:
				<br>
				<code>&nbsp;&nbsp; tar -xzf imod_4.7.1.tar.gz </code>
				<br>
				<code>&nbsp;&nbsp; mv imod_4.7.1 IMOD </code>
				<br>
				<code>&nbsp;&nbsp; cp IMOD/IMOD-cygwin.* /etc/profile.d</code></li>

			<h3>1.7. Setting Up a Windows PC and Installing IMOD without Cygwin</h3>
		</a>
    <p>To install IMOD without Cygwin using our installer package, you need to
    have Administrator privileges on Windows versions past XP because, for
    now, the installation can go only in C:\Program Files.
    </p>
    <p>You must have Python installed to use IMOD fully on Windows, as well as
    a module called psutil built for the same version of Python.  The IMOD
    installer relies on the registry entries made by Windows
    Python packages from the 
    <a href = "http://www.python.org/download/releases/">Python download
    site</a> to find Python, so a package from there is probably needed to use
    the installer.  Some packages are provided here:
    <ul>
      <li> 32-bit <a href = "http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/windows/python-2.7.6.msi">Python 2.7</a> and matching
        <a href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/windows/psutil-1.2.1.win32-py2.7.exe">psutil</a>
      <li> 64-bit <a href = "http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/windows/python-2.7.6.amd64.msi">Python 2.7</a> and matching
        <a href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/windows/psutil-1.2.1.win-amd64-py2.7.exe">psutil</a>
      <li> 32-bit <a href = "http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/windows/python-3.3.3.msi">Python 3.3</a> and matching
        <a href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/windows/psutil-1.2.1.win32-py3.3.exe">psutil</a>
      <li> 64-bit <a href = "http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/windows/python-3.2.5.amd64.msi">Python 3.2</a> and matching
        <a href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/windows/psutil-1.0.1.win-amd64-py3.2.exe">psutil</a>
    </ul>
    Unless you know or anticipate that other software will need Python 2.7,
    you might as well install Python 3.  If you need to use a Python package
    other than the ones here, get a matching version of psutil from the
    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/psutil">psutil site</a>; use the
    Download link to get to current versions and the Download tab to get to
    older versions.
    </p>
    <p>Click on the downloaded file to install it; first Python, then psutil.
    Python does not need to install in the default location that it offers;
    you can put it in <code>C:\Program Files</code> under the name of the version (e.g.,
    set the install location to <code>C:\Program Files\Python3.2</code>).
    Python installs without using "Run as Administrator", but on Windows
    versions past XP, it appears to be necessary to install psutil by
    right-clicking and selecting "Run as Administrator".
    </p>
    <p>After Python is installed, click on the IMOD installer.  It will
    install IMOD in <code>C:\Program Files\IMOD</code>, define the environment
    variables <code>IMOD_DIR</code>, <code>IMOD_CALIB_DIR</code>, and 
      <code>IMOD_PLUGIN_DIR</code>, and place both IMOD and the version of
      Python that it finds on the path.
    </p>
    <p>In order to run eTomo, you also need to have Java installed.&nbsp; If
      you do not already have Java (most machines do now), get the latest Java
      Run-time Environment from the
      <a href="http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp">Java download
        site</a>.&nbsp; Click on the file and take the defaults to
      install Java.
      When you are done, you can delete any Java icons from your desktop.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to use a better terminal window than the Command Prompt
      window, try getting the Console program from 
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/console">sourceforge</a>.  This
      program allows window resizing, font and color control, easy cutting and
      pasting with mouse buttons, and multiple tabs.
      Unzip the package wherever you want to; it will create a directory
      "Console2" with Console.exe inside, to which you can create a shortcut on your
      desktop. This <a href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/windows/console.xml">
        configuration file</a> has some good initial settings.  Make a folder
      named <code>Console</code> inside 
      <code>C:\Users\yourUserName\Application Data</code> (or 
      <code>C:\Documents and Setting\yourUserName\Application Data</code> on
      Windows XP) and place the file in that folder.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no <code>man</code> command for viewing program manual pages,
      but <code>imodhelp programName</code> will open Qt Assistant to the
      manual page for the given program.  The program name can even be
      abbreviated. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to upgrade to a beta version after you have installed IMOD
      from one of the executable installer packages, you need to download the
      appropriate self-installing package file from the beta download site,
      for example, <code>imod_4.8.10_win64.csh</code>.  Copy the file 
      <code>installIMOD</code> from C:\Program Files\IMOD to the same place
      that you put the package.  In a terminal, <code>cd</code> to that folder
      and enter (for this example file) <br>
      <pre>    installIMOD -skip imod_4.8.10_win64.csh</pre>
    </p>
		<a name="UsingGPU"></a>
		<h3>1.8. Using a GPU for Tomography</h3>
		<p>With all IMOD 4.7 packages, you can use the graphics processing unit (GPU) of an 
			NVIDIA graphics card to compute tomograms.&nbsp; The card must be of a kind 
			that supports processing with a system called CUDA, and you also need to have 
			NVIDIA drivers new enough to support CUDA.&nbsp; To see if your card can be 
			used, check it in <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus">NVIDIA's 
				lists </a>.&nbsp; Most of the packages for IMOD 4.7 are built with CUDA 
			version 4.1.&nbsp; A few packages are built with CUDA 2 or with CUDA 3.&nbsp; 
			When there are two packages for a particular operating system, the one not 
			built with CUDA 4 has CUDA and the version number in its name.&nbsp; A package 
			built with a particular version of CUDA will work with CUDA drivers of the same 
			or a higher version.&nbsp; Here are details for the three operating systems:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Linux:</b>
			the RHEL6 package of IMOD and is built
			with CUDA 4.1, so you must be running a driver version of 285.05.33 or
			higher.  It is built with CUDA 3 in the 32-bit and 64-bit RHEL5 packages,
			and you must be running a driver version of 195.36.31 or higher.
			<li>
				<b>Windows:</b>
			the capability is available in both 32 and 64 bit packages, and you must be 
			running a driver version of 286.19 or higher for a package built with CUDA 
			4.1, such as the WHQL driver, 295.73, with a date of February 21,
			2012, or any later driver.&nbsp; Driver version numbers are not
			straightforward in Windows, so the dates are helpful.  A package built with 
			CUDA 2.1 must be run with a driver version of 180.22 or later, corresponding to 
			a driver date of January, 2009 or later.  A package built with CUDA 3.0
			must be run with a driver version of 197.13 286.19 or later, corresponding
			to a driver date of March 25, 2010 or later. 
		 <li>
				<b>Mac:</b> 
				The drivers 
				that support CUDA are not part of the basic graphics drivers and must be 
				installed separately.  Once they are installed, the system may offer
				to upgrade them, or you may be able to upgrade them through a button in the Other
				section of System Preferences.&nbsp;  All driver versions are
				available at the NVIDIA <a href = "http://www.nvidia.com/object/mac-driver-archive.html">CUDA Driver Archive</a>.
				<ul>
					<li>
						If you are running OS X 10.7 - 10.9 or have a Quadro 4000 card,
							you must use an IMOD package built with CUDA 4.1.  For OS X
							10.9, version 5.5.28 or higher is required, but 5.5.28 seems to
							support only GTX 680, K5000 and K4000 cards.
							<B>Check on the
							Supported Products tab to see if your card is supported BEFORE
							upgrading to 10.9.</B>  For OSX 10.7 - 10.8, you can
							install the final CUDA 4 driver, 4.2.10, or you can try a CUDA 5
							driver if your card is supported.  
					<li>
						Otherwise, you should use an IMOD package built with CUDA 3.1 and
							install a CUDA 3 driver such as 3.2.17.
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The GPU can be enabled for use through eTomo in one of two ways.&nbsp; If you 
			have a <a href="man/cpuadoc.html#TOP">cpu.adoc</a> file to specify machines 
			available for parallel processing, then you need to add a line</p>
		<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp; gpu = 1 </code>
		</p>
		<p>to the section for each computer with a usable GPU.&nbsp; If you do not have a <code>
				cpu.adoc</code> file, then select <B>Settings</B> from the <B>Options</B> menu 
			of eTomo.&nbsp; In the box <B>User Level Enhanced Processing</B>, check <B>Enable 
				graphics processing</B></p>
		<p>
			The easiest way to test whether the GPU is functioning and computing reliably 
			is to run the command:<br>
			<code>&nbsp;&nbsp; gputilttest</code></p>
		<p>
		This will unpack test data and do a one-minute test for reproducibility.&nbsp; 
		And optional argument can be added to set the length of the test in minutes; an 
		optional second argument can be used to specify the GPU number when there is 
		more than one.&nbsp; A few cards do give variable results, so it is important 
		to test for reproducible results initially, periodically thereafter, and
		especially after upgrading the NVIDIA drivers or the operating system.

		<h3>1.9. Using the ImodCalib directory</h3>
		Several parts of IMOD look for data and configuration files in a separate 
		location, pointed to by the environment variable IMOD_CALIB_DIR. These files 
		include the <code>cpu.adoc</code> file for enabling parallel processing, 
		distortion correction files, noise files for microscope CTF correction, and 
		local startup files. The default value for IMOD_CALIB_DIR is <code>/usr/local/ImodCalib</code>
		on all platforms, and it is set in the IMOD startup scripts if it is not 
		already defined. We have designed this directory as a place for local files 
		that should not be replaced when IMOD is upgraded. Minimally, then, you may 
		want to create this directory and place a <code>cpu.adoc</code> there defining 
		the number of processors on one or more machines. In addition, the IMOD startup 
		scripts will try to source local startup scripts in this directory: <code>IMOD-...csh</code>
		will source <code>$IMOD_CALIB_DIR/IMOD.csh</code> and <code>IMOD-...sh</code> will 
		source <code>$IMOD_CALIB_DIR/IMOD.sh</code>. You can use these startup scripts 
		for customizations, such as redefining <code>IMOD_JAVADIR</code>, instead of 
		modifying the startup scripts that come with IMOD and get replaced with each 
		new version. However, if you are going to take advantage of this mechanism and 
		want to redefine <code>IMOD_CALIB_DIR</code> to point to a different location, 
		your startup must set this environment variable before sourcing the IMOD 
		startup scripts.

			<h2>2. Getting Started</h2>
		</a>
		<p>You will want to go through the <a href="3dmodguide.html#TOP">Introduction to 3dmod</a>
			because <code>3dmod</code> is the central graphical tool of the IMOD 
			package.&nbsp; If you are doing tomography, you should start with the <a href="etomoTutorial.html#TOP">
				eTomo tutorial</a>.&nbsp;This eTomo tutorial is also available in video 
			form on our&nbsp; <A href="http://www.youtube.com/bl3demc">YouTube channel</A>.&nbsp; 
			If you are doing reconstructions from serial images such as serial thin
			sections or serial block face images, you should work through the 
      <a href="serialalign.html">Serial Section Alignment guide</a>, which
      will take you through the steps needed to align the images in eTomo.
      For access to the complete IMOD documentation, just enter <code>imodhelp</code> 
			at the command line to open it in the Qt Assistant, where it can be browsed and 
			searched.&nbsp; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from learning to use the major tools, your initial problem may be
			getting data into a format usable by the IMOD programs.&nbsp; If you are
			having problems getting 
			your data into a format usable by IMOD contact us for help.</p>
		<h3>2.1. The Image Data Format and File Conversion</h3>
		<p>All of the IMOD programs read and produce files in
			the <a href="mrc_format.txt">MRC image file format</a>.  As of
			IMOD 4.7, they can also read TIFF files and files in several specialized
			image formats compatible with MRC: DigitalMicrograph, PIF files from
			Bsoft, EM, and Hanspeter Winkler's NFF.
      In addition to those formats, <code>3dmod</code> can read some other common 
			formats like JPEG, PNG, and BMP,
			and it has a dialog box and options for specifying how to read raw
			data.</p>
    <p>As of IMOD 4.7, programs will write MRC files in byte mode as signed by
    default (values of -128 to 127), which
    is a change from previous behavior to conform with a clarification of the
    MRC standards.  Such files will not be read correctly by IMOD versions
    before 4.3, and you may encounter other software that has difficulty with
    signed byte files.  Two programs have command-line options to produce
    unsigned output files (values 0-255):
    <a href="man/newstack.html#TOP">newstack</a> (option "-byte 0")
    and  <a href="man/clip.html#TOP">clip</a> (option "-m ubyte").  In
    addition, you can make all programs write unsigned bytes by setting the
    environment variable WRITE_MODE0_SIGNED to 0.
    </p>
    <p>
			Even though IMOD programs can read multiple file types, you will
			generally want to convert your data to a stack of images in MRC format, 
      because most programs are designed to operate on a stack of images
			in a single file rather than on a set of single-image files.  Thus,
			we have utility programs available for converting TIFF files and raw data into 
			the MRC file format and combining single-image files into a stack.&nbsp; 
    </p>
		<p>
			Use the program <a href="man/tif2mrc.html#TOP">tif2mrc</a> to convert a series 
			of TIFF image files into a single MRC image file. The <code>tif2mrc</code> program 
			has an option for converting 24-bit color to 8-bit grayscale images, and 
			options for dealing with unsigned 16 bit images, which are a potential problem 
			because the standard MRC format supports only signed 16-bit images. The 
			following example entry will create a MRC file from a list of TIFF files 
			(cell01.tif, cell02.tif ...).
			<br>
			<code>&nbsp;&nbsp; tif2mrc cell*.tif cell.mrc</code></p>
		<p>See the <a href="man/tif2mrc.html#TOP">tif2mrc manual page</a> for more 
			information on how to use <code>tif2mrc</code>.</p>
		<P>Use the program <a href="man/dm2mrc.html#TOP">dm2mrc</a> to convert a series of 
			DigitalMicrograph image files into a single MRC image file. The following 
			example will create a MRC file from a list of DigitalMicrograph files 
			(cell01.dm3, cell02.dm3....;&nbsp;note that dm2 and dm4 files are also 
			supported.)<BR>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size="2" face="Courier New">dm2mrc 
				cell*.dm3 cell.mrc</FONT></P>
		<P>
			If you have a series of MRC files, with one image per file, you can 
			combine them into a single stack easily with the program &nbsp;<a href="man/newstack.html#TOP">newstack</a>.&nbsp; 
			For example, enter
			<br>
			<code>&nbsp;&nbsp; newstack cell*.mrc cell.st&nbsp;</code><br>
      With the new file-reading capabilities in IMOD 4.7, you can also
      use <code>newstack</code> to stack TIFF and DigitalMicrograph files,
      provided that no special conversion options are needed.
    </P>
		<p>
			The program <a href="man/raw2mrc.html#TOP">raw2mrc</a> is used to convert raw 
			image data into the mrc format. This program can take a file of 8, 16,or 32 bit 
			integers, IEEE float values, or 24-bit RGB triplets and convert them into an 
			MRC image file. In MRC files, the data start in the lower left hand corner of 
			the image, with the data stored in rows. To use <code>raw2mrc</code>, you need 
			to know the size of the images, the type of data, and the size of any header 
			information preceding the image. &nbsp;For example, if you have a set of files 
			(cell01.em, cell02.em, ...) with 1024 x 1024 images of signed 16-bit integers, 
			and a header of 512 bytes, use:
			<br>
			<code>&nbsp;&nbsp; raw2mrc -t short -x 1024 -y 1024 -o 512 cell*.em cell.mrc</code></p>
		<p>If the data need to have their bytes swapped because they come from a machine 
			with the opposite byte ordering (e.g. PPC Mac versus Intel), use the -s option. 
			&nbsp;If you do not know something about the image, such as the header size or 
			whether the data are unsigned or need swapping, you may be able to figure it 
			out just by trying different options for data types and swapping. &nbsp;If you 
			do not know the header size, convert one file without the -o option, load it 
			into 3dmod, and try to see where the image data start. If the final MRC image 
			is upside down use the -f option in the initial conversion or use the program <a href="man/clip.html#TOP">
				clip</a> to flip the image back.</p>
		<p>When a <a href="man/3dmod.html#TOP">3dmod</a> is started with an image file that 
			it does not recognize, it brings up a dialog that allows you to specify the 
			image and header size and the data type.&nbsp; Alternatively, you can specify 
			these features with options at the command line, which could be the most 
			convenient way to experiment and find the right values.&nbsp; For example, the 
			files in the previous command could be displayed with:<br>
			<code>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3dmod -r 1024,1024,1 -H 512 -t 1 cell*.em</code>
		</p>
		<h3>2.2. The Model Format</h3>
		<p>
			If you already have a 3-D model and wish to view it within the IMOD model 
			viewing program, <code>3dmodv</code>, you will need to convert the file into 
			the IMOD format. See the IMOD model file format <a href="asciispec.html#TOP">ASCII</a>
			and <a href="binspec.html#TOP">binary specifications</a> if you wish to write 
			your own conversion program. Model files from the HVEM3D program can be 
			converted to the IMOD model format using the <a href="man/rec2imod.html#TOP">rec2imod</a>
			program.
		</p>
		<p>
			The IMOD model format can be either binary or ASCII. Currently supported 
			machines can all read and write binary model files interchangeably, so the main 
			use of the ASCII format would be to access the data for analysis or conversion 
			by other programs. To convert a binary IMOD file (binary.imod) to an ASCII IMOD 
			file (ascii.imod) use the <a href="man/imodinfo.html#TOP">imodinfo</a> command:
			<br>
			<code>&nbsp; imodinfo -a binary.imod &gt; ascii.imod</code>
			<br>
			or
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>imodinfo -a -f ascii.imod binary.imod</code>
		<p>
			will both create an ASCII model file from the binary.imod model.&nbsp; The 
			ASCII format preserves many but not all possible features in the model.&nbsp; 
			It is moderately complex and may not be the most convenient format to use for 
			exporting or importing data.&nbsp; There are also two programs,&nbsp;<a href="man/model2point.html#TOP">model2point</a>
			and&nbsp;<a href="man/point2model.html#TOP">point2model</a>, that can be used 
			to convert an IMOD model to or from a simple list of point coordinates.
		</p>
			<h2>3. Getting Quantitative Information</h2>
		</a>
		<p>In order to get accurate information the fields in the model header have to be 
			set properly. See the <a href="3dmodguide.html#SettingZ-scale">Introduction to 
				3dmod</a>&nbsp;for an explanation of how to do this. Selecting the 
			Edit-&gt;Contour-&gt;Info menu item from the 3dmod Information Window will 
			cause some quantitative information to be printed out in the bottom panel of 
			the window.</p>
		<p>
			Use the <a href="man/imodinfo.html#TOP">imodinfo</a> command to get basic 
			information from a model and print it out to a terminal or file. For example:<br>
			<code>&nbsp;&nbsp; imodinfo cell.imod </code>
		</p>
		<PRE># MODEL cell.imod<br># NAME  A little cell<br># PIX SCALE:  x = 1<br>#             y = 1<br>#             z = 9.17<br># PIX SIZE      = 0.00654<br># UNITS: um<br><br>OBJECT 1<br>NAME:  spindle pole<br>       5 contours<br>       object uses closed contours.<br>       color (red, green, blue) = (0, 1, 1)<br><br>       	CONTOUR #1,2,0  16 points, length = 0.464513,  area = 0.0134249<br>        CONTOUR #2,2,0  14 points, length = 0.458311,  area = 0.0125642<br>        CONTOUR #3,2,0  8 points,  length = 0.200755,  area = 0.00277481<br>        CONTOUR #4,2,0  13 points, length = 0.313501,  area = 0.00664029<br>        CONTOUR #5,2,0  9 points,  length = 0.232374,  area = 0.00272134<br><br>        Total volume = 0.00228646<br>        Total contour cylinder surface area = 0.10012.<br>                Total mesh surface area = 0.0349499.<br></PRE>
		<P>There are several useful command line options for imodinfo to extract lengths of 
			contours into a single column output, print surface and point size information, 
			and&nbsp;compute&nbsp;volumes and mesh areas.&nbsp;A text file can be created 
			using the -f option.</P>
