The MRC file format used by IMOD.

The MRC header, length 1024 bytes.  Names are the the names used in C code.

OFFSET  SIZE DATA    NAME	Description

  0 000  4   int     nx;	Number of Columns 
  4 004  4   int     ny;        Number of Rows
  8 010  4   int     nz;        Number of Sections.

 12 014  4   int     mode;      Types of pixel in image.  Values used by IMOD:
         	       	 0 = unsigned or signed bytes depending on flag in imodStamp
                             only unsigned bytes before IMOD 4.2.23
         	       	 1 = signed short integers (16 bits)
         	       	 2 = float
         	       	 3 = short * 2, (used for complex data)
         	       	 4 = float * 2, (used for complex data)
                         6 = unsigned 16-bit integers (non-standard)
         	       	16 = unsigned char * 3 (for rgb data, non-standard)

 16 020  4   int     nxstart;     Starting point of sub image (not used in IMOD)  
 20 024  4   int     nystart;
 24 030  4   int     nzstart;

 28 034  4   int     mx;         Grid size in X, Y, and Z       
 32 040  4   int     my;
 36 044  4   int     mz;

 40 050  4   float   xlen;       Cell size; pixel spacing = xlen/mx, ylen/my, zlen/mz
 44 054  4   float   ylen;
 48 060  4   float   zlen;

 52 064  4   float   alpha;      cell angles - ignored by IMOD
 56 070  4   float   beta;
 60 074  4   float   gamma;

         	       	 These need to be set to 1, 2, and 3 for pixel spacing
                                   to be interpreted correctly
 64 100  4   int     mapc;       map column  1=x,2=y,3=z.       
 68 104  4   int     mapr;       map row     1=x,2=y,3=z.       
 72 110  4   int     maps;       map section 1=x,2=y,3=z.       

                                 These need to be set for proper scaling of data
 76 114  4   float   amin;       Minimum pixel value.
 80 120  4   float   amax;       Maximum pixel value.
 84 124  4   float   amean;      Mean pixel value.

 88 130  4   int     ispg;       space group number (ignored by IMOD)
 92 134  4   int     next;       number of bytes in extended header (called nsymbt in
                                   MRC standard)
 96 140  2   short   creatid;    used to be an ID number, is 0 as of IMOD 4.2.23
 98 142  30  ---     extra data  (not used, first two bytes should be 0)

                                 These two values specify the structure of data in the
                                 extended header; their meaning depend on whether the
                                 extended header has the Agard format, a series of
                                 4-byte integers then real numbers, or has data 
                                 produced by SerialEM, a series of short integers.
                                 SerialEM stores a float as two shorts, s1 and s2, by:
                                   value = (sign of s1)*(|s1|*256 + (|s2| modulo 256))
                                      * 2**((sign of s2) * (|s2|/256))
128 200  2   short   nint;       Number of integers per section (Agard format) or
                                 number of bytes per section (SerialEM format)
130 202  2   short   nreal;      Number of reals per section (Agard format) or bit
                                 flags for which types of short data (SerialEM format):
                                 1 = tilt angle * 100  (2 bytes)
                                 2 = piece coordinates for montage  (6 bytes)
                                 4 = Stage position * 25    (4 bytes)
                                 8 = Magnification / 100 (2 bytes)
                                 16 = Intensity * 25000  (2 bytes)
                                 32 = Exposure dose in e-/A2, a float in 4 bytes
                                 128, 512: Reserved for 4-byte items
                                 64, 256, 1024: Reserved for 2-byte items
                                 If the number of bytes implied by these flags does
                                 not add up to the value in nint, then nint and nreal
                                 are interpreted as ints and reals per section

132 204  20  ---     extra data (not used)

152 230  4   int     imodStamp   1146047817 indicates that file was created by IMOD or 
                                 other software that uses bit flags in the following field
156 234  4   int     imodFlags   Bit flags:
                                 1 = bytes are stored as signed
                                 2 = pixel spacing was set from size in extended header 

                              Explanation of type of data.
160 240  2   short   idtype;  ( 0 = mono, 1 = tilt, 2 = tilts, 3 = lina, 4 = lins)
162 242  2   short   lens;
164 244  2   short   nd1;	for idtype = 1, nd1 = axis (1, 2, or 3)     
166 246  2   short   nd2;
168 250  2   short   vd1;                       vd1 = 100. * tilt increment
170 252  2   short   vd2;                       vd2 = 100. * starting angle

                		Current angles are used to rotate a model to match a
                                new rotated image.  The three values in each set are
                                rotations about X, Y, and Z axes, applied in the order
                                Z, Y, X.
172 254  24  float   tiltangles[6];  0,1,2 = original:  3,4,5 = current 

                               The image origin is the location of the origin of the
                               coordinate system relative to the first pixel in the
                               file.  It is in pixel spacing units rather than in
                               pixels.  If an original volume has an origin of 0, a
                               subvolume should have negative origin values.

208 320  4   char    cmap;      Contains "MAP "
212 324  4   char    stamp;     First two bytes have 17 and 17 for big-endian or 
                                  68 and 65 for little-endian
216 330  4   float   rms;       RMS deviation of densities from mean density

        ALL HEADERS:
220 334  4   int     nlabl;  	Number of labels with useful data.
224 340  800 char[10][80]    	10 labels of 80 charactors.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Offsets are given as bytes in decimal and octal.
Total size of header is 1024 bytes plus the size of the extended header.
 
Image data follows with the origin in the lower left corner,
looking down on the volume.

The size of the image is nx * ny * nz * (mode data size).
