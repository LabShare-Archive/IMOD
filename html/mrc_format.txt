30   ---     extra data (not used)

                         These two values specify the structure of data in the
                         extended header; their meaning depend on whether the
                         extended header has the Agard format, a series of
                         4-byte integers then real numbers, or has data 
                         produced by SerialEM, a series of short integers.
                         SerialEM stores a float as two shorts, s1 and s2, by:
                           value = (sign of s1)*(|s1|*256 + (|s2| modulo 256))
                              * 2**((sign of s2) * (|s2|/256))
2    short   nint;       Number of integers per section (Agard format) or
                         number of bytes per section (SerialEM format)
2    short   nreal;      Number of reals per section (Agard format) or
                         flags for which types of short data (SerialEM format):
                         1 = tilt angle * 100  (2 bytes)
                         2 = piece coordinates for montage  (6 bytes)
                         4 = Stage position * 25    (4 bytes)
                         8 = Magnification / 100 (2 bytes)
                         16 = Intensity * 25000  (2 bytes)
                         32 = Exposure dose in e-/A2, a float in 4 bytes
                         128, 512: Reserved for 4-byte items
                         64, 256, 1024: Reserved for 2-byte items
                         If the number of bytes implied by these flags does
                         not add up to the value in nint, then nint and nreal
                         are interpreted as ints and reals per section

28   ---     extra data (not used)

                      Explanation of type of data.
2    short   idtype;  ( 0 = mono, 1 = tilt, 2 = tilts, 3 = lina, 4 = lins)
2    short   lens;
2    short   nd1;	for idtype = 1, nd1 = axis (1, 2, or 3)     
2    short   nd2;
2    short   vd1;                       vd1 = 100. * tilt increment
2    short   vd2;                       vd2 = 100. * starting angle

        		Current angles are used to rotate a model to match a
                        new rotated image.  The three values in each set are
                        rotations about X, Y, and Z axes, applied in the order
                        Z, Y, X.
24   float   tiltangles[6];  0,1,2 = original:  3,4,5 = current 

                       The image origin is the location of the origin of the
                       coordinate system relative to the first pixel in the
                       file.  It is in pixel spacing units rather than in
                       pixels.  If an original volume has an origin of 0, a
                       subvolume should have negative origin values.

NEW-STYLE MRC image2000 HEADER - IMOD 2.6.20 and above:
4    float   xorg;      Origin of image
4    float   yorg;
4    float   zorg;

4    char    cmap;      Contains "MAP "
4    char    stamp;     First two bytes have 17 and 17 for big-endian or 
                          68 and 65 for little-endian
4    float   rms;       RMS deviation of densities from mean density

ALL HEADERS:
4    int     nlabl;  	Number of labels with useful data.
800  char[10][80]    	10 labels of 80 charactors.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Total size of header is 1024 bytes plus the size of the extended header.
 
Image data follows with the origin in the lower left corner,
looking down on the volume.

The size of the image is nx * ny * nz * (mode data size).
