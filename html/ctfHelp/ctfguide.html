<A NAME = "TOP"><h2 align="center">Guide to Ctfplotter</h2></A>
<h3 align="center">Boulder Laboratory for 3-D Electron Microscopy of
Cells</h3>
<p>
Ctfplotter plots noise-subtracted, rotationally averaged power spectra from
tilt series data and allows one to determine the position of the first zero of
the microscope CTF.  The power spectra are obtained by extracting small
squares of image (referred to as tiles) that overlap by 50%, taking their
2D Fourier transforms, rotationally averaging the transforms to obtain
one-dimensional curves, dividing by the corresponding curves obtained from
images consisting only of noise, and summing these 1D curves.
Once defocus is determined from such power spectra, the phase
inversions of the CTF can be corrected with the program 
<a href="../man/ctfphaseflip.html#TOP">Ctfphaseflip</a>.  Defocus
can be found in angular subranges of the tilt series.  The defocus values are
stored in a table so that they can be visualized, deleted, or recomputed if
necessary. All of the values in the table are saved to the defocus file, which
is provided as input to Ctfphaseflip.
<h2>The CTF Graph</h2>
<OL>
<LI> The plotter shows graphs of image power as a function of spatial
frequency.  The X coordinate is in cycles per pixel (also referred to as 
reciprocal pixels).
0.5 equals the Nyquist frequency determined by the pixel size.
If the pixel size is in nanometers, any frequency on the X axis can be
converted to 1/nm by dividing by the pixel size. 
<br> The Y coordinate is the logarithm of image power.</li>
<li> The red curve is the logarithm of the power spectrum
of the selected views after subtracting the noise floor. <br>
If you use a fitting method that fits just one curve, the green curve fits the 
red curve from "X1_starts" to "X2_ends", which can be set in the fitting range
dialog.<br>
If you use a method that fits two curves, the green curve is fit to the
red curve from "X1_starts" to "X1_ends" and the blue curve
fits the red curve from "X2_starts" to" X2_ends", all of which can be set in
the fitting range dialog.<br>
In either case, the curves are drawn over the whole frequency range.</li>
<li> To zoom in an area, hold down the left mouse button down and
draw a rubber band around that area. <br>
To go back to the previous zoom level, push the Zoom-out icon.<br>
Successive zooms are kept in a list, and you can go forward or backward
through the zooms using either the Zoom-in and Zoom-out icons or the standard
hot keys for zooming in 3dmod, "-" or "+/=". </li>
<li>
Use arrow keys to scroll vertically and horizontally.  You can also use the
mouse scroll wheel to scroll vertically.</li>
<li> The text field marked
with "Z" on the top line reports the normalized frequency of the
first zero, either found by fitting to the power spectra, or set by
double-clicking with the left mouse button.  The absolute frequency of the
first zero in 1/nm is (normalized frequency)*(Nyquist frequency).<br>
The text field marked with "D" on the top line
reports the found defocus in microns.<br>
If you double-click on the position of the
second zero with the middle or right mouse button, the text field marked "D2"
shows the defocus implied by that second zero position, and the text field
marked "D-avg" shows the average of the defocus from the first and second
zeros.</li>
<li> Double clicking at a point in the plot with the left mouse button will set
the found frequency of the first zero to the frequency at point.<br>
The found defocus field will
change accordingly. This is useful for manually locating the first zero
and finding its corresponding defocus.<br>
Once a first zero position is set either by fitting or manually clicking,
double-clicking with the middle or right mouse button can be used to indicate
the second zero position.  The text fields based on the second zero will be
set back to "NA" whenever a new first zero is set.</li>

<h2>Fitting Ranges & Methods Dialog
</h2>
This dialog allows three different kinds of fitting, which can be selected by 
the radio buttons at the top.  After changing parameters, either press
<B>Apply</B> or type the "Enter" key in one of the text boxes to have the fit
recomputed with the current parameters.
<p>
<img alt="rangeDialog" src="rangeCTF-like.png">
</P><P>
Fitting to a CTF-like curve involves finding four parameters, or five if the
option <B>Vary exponent of CTF function</B> is selected.  Varying the exponent
can allow the curve to fit better to the width of the dip around the first
zero, but since it adds a parameter, it can destabilize the fitting and
produce bad results in some cases.  One of the parameters of the curve is the
defocus.
</P>
<p>
The range of the curve is set from the entries <B>X1 Starts</B> and 
<B>X2 Ends</B>.  When the program first starts, it sets these values to be
about 0.05/pixel before the first zero, and close to the second zero,
respectively, based on the expected defocus.  If necessary, you should adjust
the starting value so that it is to the right of where the fitted curve
strongly deviates from the actual.  If the red curve become noisy and falls
off before a second zero, you should also reduce the ending point of the fit
to exclude that region.  See the example below.
</P>
<P>
The fit does rely on an initial approximate value for the defocus and may
fail if the actual defocus is far from that value.  It takes
this value either from the expected defocus or from the current defocus
estimate, depending on whether the option is selected to use the current
defocus estimate in the Tilt Angle Range Dialog.  If the defocus revealed by
the power spectrum is far from the expected defocus, you should either change
the value of the expected defocus, or select the option to use the current
defocus estimate and make sure that estimate is approximately correct.
</P>
<p>
<img src="rangePolynomial.png">
</P><P>
You can also fit a polynomial to the region around the first zero.
The <B>Order of polynomial</B> spin button allows you to select an order
between 2 and 6, which involves finding 3 to 7 parameters.  The goal here is
to get a smooth curve through the dip; the minimum
of the curve is taken as the location of the first zero.
</P>
<p>
As for CTF-like fitting, the range of the curve is set from the entries 
<B>X1 Starts</B> and <B>X2 Ends</B>.  Since you are just trying to localize
the dip at the first zero, you should restrict the range as necessary to get a
good fit there.
</P>

<p>
<img src="rangeIntersect.png">
</P><P>
Finding the zero at the intersection of two curves involves fitting two
separate curves, before and after the first zero.  Each can be fit to either a
straight line or a Gaussian over the selected range.  The program finds the
intersection of the two curves, if possible, and assigns that as the first
zero.
</P>
<P>
X1 sets the fitting range for the curve before the first
zero, drawn in green. Use the <B>X1 fitting method</B> radio
button to select whether to fit to a straight line or to a Gaussian.
</P>
<P>
X2 sets the fitting range for the
curve after the first zero, drawn in blue. Use the <B>X2 fitting method</B>
radio button to
fit to a straight line or to a Gaussian.
</P>

<h2>Angle Range and Tile Selection Dialog<br>
</h2>
This dialog presents the various parameters that control how the power
spectrum is computed.  After changing parameters, either press
<B>Apply</B> or type the "Enter" key in one of the text boxes to have the curve
recomputed with the current parameters.  The dialog also shows the table of
defocus values and allows it to be manipulated.  Because of the importance of
this dialog, it is opened automatically when the program starts.
<P>
<img alt="angleDialog" src="angleDialog.png">
</P><P>
<B>Starting tilt angle</B><br>
<B>Ending tilt angle</B>: <br>
The views with tilt angle
greater than or equal to the starting angle but less than or equal to the
ending angle will be included in the estimation.  If you enter a value beyond
the end of the range of angles in the tilt series, it will be adjusted to the
starting or ending angle of the series.
</P><P>
<B>Step angle range</B>:<br>
Pressing <B>Step Up</b> or <B>Step Down</B> will shift the angular range by
the amount in the <B>Step angle range by</B> text box.  This step size will be
added to or subtracted from both the starting and ending tilt angles.  If the
shift would make one of the limiting angles go outside the bounds of the
tilt series, both angles are changed by a lesser amount so as to keep the
range the same size.  The power spectrum is computed and fit to at the new
angular range.  The step size is initialized to be half the original angular
range.
</P><P>
<B>Autofitting</B>:<br>
Once fitting parameters have been set optimally and an appropriate angular
range has been chosen, the <B>Autofit All Steps</B> button can be used to step
automatically to a series of angular ranges, find the defocus, and store the
defocus in the table.
<UL>
<LI>The angular range will be the same as the range between the <B>Starting
    tilt angle</B> and <B>Ending tilt angle</B> entries.</LI>
<LI>Ranges will span the angular extent specified in the <B>Autofit:</B>
  and <b>to</b> text boxes.  Specifically, the first range will start at the
  angle in the <B>Autofit:</B> box and the last range will end at the value in
  the <b>to</b> box.  These boxes are initialized with the starting and
  ending tilt angles of the series.</LI>
<LI>The spacing between ranges will be approximately that specified in the 
<B>Step angle range by</B> entry, adjusted to span the desired angular
extent.</LI>
<LI>With a step size of 0, each image in the desired angular extent will be
  fit separately, regardless of the size of the current angular range.</LI>
<LI>The current settings for <B>Which defocus to use</B> and <B>Initial tiles
    to include</B> are used in computing and fitting the power spectra.  If
    the current defocus is selected for use, each power spectrum fit will be
    iterated three times to reach a consistent defocus value.</LI>
<LI>If there are already values in the defocus table, the program will ask
  whether you want to remove or retain ones that are already present in the extent being
  analyzed.  The message will list the middle of the tilt angle range for the
  first and last one to be removed.  If existing entries get deleted, look
  carefully at the end of the range for ones that might not have been deleted.</LI>
</UL>
</P><P>
<B>Tile parameters</B>:<br>
The <B>+</B> pushbutton will open up a section of the dialog for parameters
that are rarely adjusted; they include:
<ul>
<LI>
<B>Tile size</B>: the tile size in pixels.</li>
<li><B>Tilt axis angle</B>: 
The amount in degrees that the tilt axis deviates from being vertical
(Y axis)</li>
<li><b>Center defocus tol</B>: 
The image region with defocus difference less than this tolerance is
defined as the center region.</li>
<li><B>Left defocus tol</B> and <B>Right defocus tol</B>:
These two entries set the maximum defocus difference for adding in
tiles from image regions to the left and right of the center region,
respectively,
after the "Adding Noncenter Tiles" button is pushed,
or if the <B>All tiles</B> radio
button is selected.
You can set one to be small and the other large in order to 
assess the results of
adding in tiles from only one side of the image, but this will mix tiles at
lower and higher defocuses unless the tilt angles are all positive or all
negative.</li>
</ul>
</P><P>
<B>Expected defocus</B>: <br>
This field starts out with the expected defocus value
specified in the parameter file, but you can change it.  Initially, this value
is used to compute the expected frequency of the first zero of the power
spectrum and to set
the initial values of the X1 and X2 ranges which determine what segments of
the power spectrum are fitted.
When non-center tiles are being included, Ctfplotter uses a defocus to
compute shifts needed to align the power spectra of non-center
tiles with the CTF curve of center tiles. With the radio button group
<B>Which defocus to use</B>, you can specify 
whether to use the expected defocus shown in the <B>Expected defocus
(um)</B> Edit field or the defocus previously found by the
program as the defocus for computing the shifts.
</P><P>
<B>Initial tiles to include</B> radio
button group:<br>
Choose whether or not to include the noncenter tiles in the estimation
when computing the power spectrum.<br>
If <B>Only central tiles</B> is checked, only the center region defined by
<B>Center defocus tol</B> will be
included in the next computation, and the "Adding Non-center Tiles" button
will be enabled.  You need to push that button to add the left region
defined by <B>Left defocus tol</B> and the right region
defined by <B>Right defocus tol</B>
to the estimation.<br>
If <B>All tiles</B>&nbsp; is checked,
all regions (center, left, right) will be included when the curve is
recomputed,
and the "Adding Non-center Tiles" button will be disabled.<br>
</P><P>
<B>Store Defocus in Table:</B>
<br>
Push this button to store
the defocus found for
the selected views in the angles and defocus table.&nbsp; The defocus
indicated by "D" is stored unless a second zero has been clicked, in which
case the average defocus indicated by "D-avg" is stored.
</P><P>
<B>Angles and Defocus Table:</B>
<br>
This table shows the starting and ending tilt angle,
the middle of the angular range, and the defocus value for each range where
you have stored results.  The lines are in order by the middle of the angular
range.  When you store a value for an angular range matching that of an
existing line in the table, the existing defocus value is replaced with the
new one.  When the program starts, this table is loaded with values from an
existing version of the output file.  Below the table are three buttons that
operate on the table:
</P><P>
Push the <B>Delete Row</B> button to delete the entry for the currently
selected row of the table. If you store
results for an angular range and then want to replace them with results from a
wider or narrower range, you would need to delete the row with the initial
results.
</P><P>
Push the <B>Set Tilt Angles</B> button to reset the starting and ending tilt
angles to the values on the currently selected row of the table and recompute
the power spectrum.  To conveniently step through a series of angular ranges,
click the mouse anywhere on a row to select that row of the table.
Then press the <B>Set Tilt Angles</B> button with the mouse, or using the
keyboard accelerator Alt-T.  Thereafter, you can type an up
or down arrow key to move up or down in the table and press this button again,
without moving the mouse.
</P><P>
Push the <B>Save to File</B> button to write the contents of the angles and
defocus table to the output file.

</P>
<h2>Example</h2>
This example shows the appearance of the plotting window with a tilt series
from bovine papilloma virus, taken at a nominal defocus of 3 microns and a
pixel size of 0.76 nm.  When the program is started with the default
angular range in the command file, the window looks like this:
</P><P>
<img src="plotStartup.png">
</P><P>
The range of the display in Y is dominated by the power at low frequencies, so
it is essential to zoom the display.  This graph was zoomed by pressing the
left mouse button with the cursor just at the place where the green and red
curves diverge (at ~0.125 in X), then dragging the mouse to just below the 
curves and just to the left of 0.4 to set the lower right corner of the rubber
band.  Then the window looks like this:
</P><P>
<img src="plotCenterZoom.png">
</P><P>
Now we can see more clearly that the background subtraction is giving a
reasonable power spectrum that is close to flat at high frequencies.
The next step is to add in all of tiles, either by pushing the "Adding
Non-center Tiles" button or by opening the Angle range dialog and switching to
the <B>All tiles</B> option.  These two methods will give slightly different
results, and the latter is actually preferable.
</P><P>
<img src="plotAllTiles.png">
</P><P>
The power spectrum is much smoother and it is now easier to see that it has a
discernable dip, but that the green
curve does not fit very well. If we open the Fitting Range & Method dialog, we
see that it is fitting from 0.215 to 0.39, a range that was determined from the
nominal defocus but is not quite appropriate for the actual defocus.  The
range was changed to what was shown above in the dialog: the left side was
moved to 0.19 to include more of the falling phase of the power spectrum, and the
right side was reduced to 0.29 because the power spectrum drops off after that
point, well before its second zero.  At this point it is also clear that the
actual defocus is different from 3 microns, so we select the <B>Current
defocus estimate</B> radio button in the Angle Range dialog so that the
shifting from non-centered tiles will be more accurate.
If the fitting were unstable, a better way to do this would be to
change the <B>Expected defocus</B> entry.
After recomputing the curves and zooming the display again, it looks
like this:
</P><P>
<img src="plotFixRange.png">
</P><P>
Here we see that the
CTF-like fitting works fairly well near the bottom of the dip, and that it
leads to a defocus estimate significantly different from the nominal defocus.
Turning on the <B>Vary exponent of CTF function</B> gives a slightly better
fit:
</P><P>
<img src="plotPower.png">
</P><P>
This fitting method can now be used over different angular ranges, and the
results can be stored from each range.  If <B>Autofit All Steps</B> is
used over the full extent of the tilt series, four ranges have defocus values
near 3.5 but the last one has a value of only 2.5 microns.  The curve for this
range lacks a dip, so this value is wrong.  This problem is solved by
restricting the high end of the extent analyzed to 57 degrees.  After running
with this extent and loading the last range to verify that its spectrum has a
dip, the angle dialog looks like this:
</P><P>
<img src="angleAutofit.png">

Although there is no need to try the
different fitting methods with this data set, they are illustrated next.

This panel shows the power spectrum for a different angular range (-50 to -10
degrees) with a
fourth-order polynomial fit to the frequency range shown in the dialog above.
As is typical of polynomials, the green curve goes off wildly outside the
fitting range.
</P><P>

This panel shows the power spectrum for the original angular range with
determination of the zero from the intersection of two curves, with the
frequency range as shown in the dialog above.
