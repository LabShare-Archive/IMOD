<a name="overall"></a><big>1. The X coordinate is normalized frequency.
1.0 equals the Nyquist frequency determined by the pixel size.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our case the pixel
size is in nanometers, the Nyquist frequency in 1/nm would be
0.5*1.0/pixel_size.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Edit field marked
with Z at the top center reports the found normalized frequency of the
first zero.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The absolute frequency of the first
zero in 1/nm is (normalized frequency)*(Nyquist frequency).<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The Edit field marked with D at the
top center reports the found defocus in microns.<br>
<a name="two"></a>2. The red curve is the logrithm of the CTF
curve of the selected slices after subtracting the noise floor. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The green curve fits the red
curve from X1_starts to X1_ends which can be set in the fitting range
dialog.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blue </big><big>curve
fits the red curve from X2_starts to X2_ends which can be set in the
fitting range dialog.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The intersection point of
the green curve and the blue curve is where the program finds the first
zero of the CTF.<br>

left
mouse button to
draw rubber bands around that area. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To go back to previous zoom
level, push the Zoom_out icon.<br>
<a name="intro2"></a>4.
Use arrow keys to scroll vertically and horizontally.<br>
<a name="five"></a>5. Double clicking at a point in the plot will set
the found frequency of the first zero to the frequency that point is
located at.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The found defocus field will
change accordingly. This is usefull in manually locating the first zero
and finding its corresponding defocus.<br>

The first time this diaglog is brought up, the expected defocus value
the user specifies in the parameter file is shown.<br>
When ctfplotter computes its first estimation, It finds the frequency
the first zero of the CTF curve with this original<br>
&nbsp;expected defocus locates at. The segments of the CTF curve of the
input stack around that frequency are selected to be fitted.<br>
For the subsequent estimation,&nbsp; ctfplotter uses a defocus to
compute shifts needed to align the CTF curves of non-center <br>
strips with the CTF curve of center strips. By the radio button group
'Which defocus to use', the user can specify <br>
whether to use the expected defocus shown in the 'Expected defocus
(um)' Edit field or the defocus previously found by the <br>
program as the defocus for computing the shifts.<br>
<br>
Center defocus tol: <br>
The image region with defocus difference less than this tolerance is
defined as
the center region.<br>
<br>
Left defocus tol: <br>
The image region left to the center region with defocus difference less
than this
tolerance <br>
will be included after the Adding Noncenter Strips button is pushed.<br>
<br>
</small></big></big><big><big><small>Right defocus tol: <br>

Tilt axis angle:<br>
The amount in degrees that the tilt axis deviates from being vertical
