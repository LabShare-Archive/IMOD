<H2  align="center">IMOD Library Documentation</H2>
Here are links to documentation of the IMOD libraries.  Almost all of it is
automatically extracted from the source code with the program sourcedoc.  The
documentation is being added gradually, but the C/C++ libraries listed here
are now completely documented.
<P>
Whenever the documentation indicates that a function returns a
non-zero number for an error, it returns 0 for success.
