<H2  align="center">IMOD Library Documentation</H2>
Here are links to documentation of the IMOD libraries and of the functions
used when making a plugin to 3dmod.  Almost all of it is
automatically extracted from the source code with the program sourcedoc.  The
documentation is being added gradually, but the C/C++ libraries
are now completely documented.
<P>
Whenever the documentation indicates that a function returns a
non-zero number for an error, it returns 0 for success.
