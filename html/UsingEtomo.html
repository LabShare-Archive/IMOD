<h1 class="western"><a name="Usage|outline"></a>Usage</h1>
<p class="western">eTomo provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to
the IMOD Tomography package. The general user interface design idea
on which eTomo is built is to present a separate panel for each
distinct step in computing a tomogram with the IMOD package. This
allows the user to focus on the current step in the processing
sequence,
presenting only the parameters and controls required for the current
step.</p>
<h2 class="western">Starting eTomo</h2>
<p class="western">eTomo can be started from the command line with
the command</p>
<dl>
  <dd><i>etomo</i></dd>
  <dd style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm;"> <br>
    <br>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="western">
It may take a little while to come up; Java applications have a slow
startup time. You can also open up a previous dataset by specifying
the relative path to the .edf file on the command line, such as</p>
<dl>
  <dd style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm;"><i>etomo path/to/dataset.edf</i></dd>
</dl>
<p class="western">
<br>
<br>
</p>
<h2 class="western">The Setup Panel</h2>
<p class="western">When eTomo is first started the <b>Setup Panel</b>
is shown; at this point you can either setup the processing for a new
tomogram, open one that was previously being worked on, or open several
other interfaces (see below). </p>
<p class="western">To start working on a new dataset you need to fill
out the fields in the <b>Setup Panel</b>. </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="western">The <b>Dataset Name</b> is the name of the file
containing the projection sequence (or the name of one of these files
in the case of a dual axis tomogram). You can enter the <b>Dataset Name</b>
by opening the file selection dialog window using the folder labeled
button associated with the <b>Dataset Name</b> field. Alternatively,
you may enter the relative path to the projection sequence file
directly into the edit box.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="western">The <b>Backup Directory</b> is optionally
available to save small working files every time you run a procedure.
You can leave this field empty if you do not wish to use a backup
directory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="western">Specify the pixel size, fiducial size and image
rotation in the appropriate fields.&nbsp; If the header of your image
file includes pixel size and/or image rotation information, press the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Scan Header</span> button to extract these
values.<br>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="western">Specify the source for the tilt angles for
either one or both axes, as appropriate. You can also optionally
specify individual projections to exclude from the processing. The
syntax for this exclude list is a comma separated list of ranges (i.e.
1,4-5,60-70)</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="western">Press the <b>Create com scripts</b> button to move
on to generating the tomogram. You can also use an existing set of
com scripts by pressing the <b>Use existing coms</b> button; just be
sure that the setup parameters you have entered exactly match those
that were entered using <i>copytomocoms</i>.</p>
<p class="western">To return to a previous tomogram, select the .edf
(eTomo Data File) file from the most recently used list on the bottom
of the File menu, or the Open... item on the File menu if the .edf is
not listed in the most recently used list. The file dialog will let
you navigate around to select the .edf file associated with the
tomogram you wish to work on.</p>
<h2 class="western">The Main Window</h2>
<p class="western">The main window consists of several areas: on the
left is a column of buttons (<b>Process Control Buttons</b>) that
allow you to select the particular step of the tomogram computation
to work on, the top center is the <b>Process Monitor</b> that will
inform you of the status of the current process or the last process
completed and a button to kill the current process, the bottom status
bar presents some basic information about the dataset you are working
on. If you are working on a dual axis tomogram this layout will be
repeated for both the A and B axes.</p>
<p class="western">The <b>Process Control Buttons</b> are arranged in
the suggested order of processing from top to bottom and are color
coded to signify the state of the process. Red indicates that the
process has not been started, magenta indicates that the process is
in progress, and green indicates that the process has been completed.
The state of the process is also indicated in text on the button.
When one of the buttons is selected the right side of the window will
fill in with information and fields associated with that process;
these forms are called <b>Process Panels</b>. They allow you to
modify the necessary parameters and execute the programs required by
that processing step. The parameters and buttons on each <b>Process
Panel</b> are typically laid out from top to bottom in the order they
should be executed. When you execute a process (by pressing a button
on one of the <b>Process Panels</b>) the <b>Process Monitor</b> will
indicate what the process is doing and when it is complete.&nbsp; In
many cases, the button that you pressed will turn dark to indicate that
the operation has been completed.<br>
</p>
<p class="western">The text output of a particular process is written
to a log file named for the particular process; this log file can be
viewed by right clicking the mouse pointer over the window region
associated with the process. This will open a menu that is split into
three sections: the entries in the first section will open up the log
files associated with the current process; the second section will
allow you to open up man pages associated with the current
process; the final menu section opens the general help documents.
There is more information regarding online help resources in the
section <a href="#Accessing%20Help%7Coutline">Accessing Help</a>.</p>
<p class="western">When you are done with all of the processes for a
given step press the <b>Done</b> button; this will inform eTomo that
the step is complete and will also move the GUI forward to the next
step in the tomogram processing. Pressing the <b>Postpone</b> button
will save all of the current parameters for that step and pressing
<b>Cancel</b> will abort all of the changes made since the last
process was run for that step. If you move between process panels by
pressing the buttons in the left column, this will save the current
parameters just as a Postpone does.&nbsp; The final button of interest
at the
bottom of most processing panels is the <b>Advanced</b> button. This
will present a much more complete list of parameters for each step,
which are mostly needed for unique or extreme cases.</p>
<p class="western">Since the number of parameters that a particular
step requires can vary significantly, <span
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">.epp</span>the amount
of screen space the
GUI needs to present that information also changes. The current version
of the program will adjust the window size automatically to fit tightly
around the <b>Process Panel </b>whenever you change
screens or change the amount of information displayed (such as by
changing to advanced mode).&nbsp; You make this fitting occur
automatically by selecting the <b>Options/Fit Window</b>
menu item or using Ctrl-F hot key.&nbsp; Whenever the window is
too small to display the information, scroll bars will appear so that
you can pan across the <b>Process Panel</b>.&nbsp; To reduce the need
for scrolling, several of the large panels are divided into sections
that can be opened or closed independently with a button in the
upper-left corner.&nbsp; This button is initially "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">-</span>" when the section is open, and
becomes "<span style="font-weight: bold;">+</span>" when the section is
closed.&nbsp; In addition, a<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
button may appear in the upper right corner to allow a section to be
switched to advanced or basic mode independently of the others; this
button will be labeled <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span> in
basic mode and <span style="font-weight: bold;">B</span> in
advanced.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p class="western">If you are working on a dual axis tomogram, each
tomogram is processed in a separate window.&nbsp; The upper left corner
of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Axis A</span> window (or the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Axis B</span> window, if it is the only one
open) will have buttons to allow you to switch between displaying one
or the other axis or both axes.&nbsp; There are also hot keys, Ctrl-A,
Ctrl-B, and Ctrl-2, to display axis A, axis B, or both. <br>
</p>
<p class="western">Every process panel has one or more buttons for
starting 3dmod to display an image file.&nbsp; To make it easier to
deal with very large data sets and problems that require more control
over the way that 3dmod is run, there are two ways to make 3dmod load
in images binned by 2 or to make it open with its startup window, so
that options can be selected.&nbsp; One way is to right-click on one of
these buttons, then select <span style="font-weight: bold;">Open with
startup window</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Open binned
by 2.</span>&nbsp; The other way is to select the corresponding items
in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Options</span> menu, which
will make 3dmod open that way every time.<br>
</p>
<p class="western">It is possible to load more than one data set into
eTomo.&nbsp; Under the <span style="font-weight: bold;">File</span>
menu there are entries to open an existing data set, open a new Setup
window for tomogram processing, or open a new window to setup joining
serial sections.&nbsp; If you start working on more than one data set
by any of these routes, eTomo will place each data set in a separate
tab so that you can go between them easily.<br>
</p>
<p class="western">The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Options/Settings</span>
dialog presents several configuration options, such as one to change
the font size being used, and one to switch to a compact display in
which the buttons on the left are very small.&nbsp; It may be necessary
to close and reopen the program to see options like these take full
effect.<br>
</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="Accessing Help|outline"></a>Accessing
Help</h2>
<p class="western">One of the significant features of the eTomo GUI
is the immediate access to context sensitive online help. By context
sensitive we mean that the help being presented is specific to the
current processing problem at hand. Access to the online help is
available through two methods. The first, commonly know as Tooltips,
is accessed by leaving the mouse stationary over the parameter or
other GUI object of interest. This will pop up a short text
description of the parameter or function of the object. The object
being described can be changed by moving the mouse around or the
description can be removed by moving the mouse over a blank window
region. The description will also be dismissed (disappear) after a
short time if the mouse is not moved. Both the amount of time to
delay displaying the Tooltip and the amount of time to keep the
Tooltip visible can be set in the <b>Options/Settings</b> dialog.</p>
<p class="western">The second method to access context sensitive help
is by right clicking the mouse over the processing region of
interest. This will open up a pop-up menu containing three sections.
The top section presents menu items that will open up a new window
containing a log file appropriate for the current processing step.
The second section presents menu items that will open up the
appropriate man pages for the current processing step. The final
section provides access to the Tomography Guide, Serial Section Joining
Guide, IMOD Guide and the 3dmod Introduction. If
the Tomography Guide is selected the Guide will be opened up to the
section that is appropriate for the current processing step.&nbsp; All
documentation is opened in the Qt Assistant, so that you can follow
hyperlinks and return from them, as well as have access to the full
IMOD documentation using the sidebar on the left.<br>
</p>
<h2 class="western">Saving Your Work</h2>
<p class="western">The current state of the
processing and the value of any parameters you entered or changed (that
are not saved in the underlying com scripts) are saved automatically to
a file with the dataset name and the extension .edf.&nbsp; If you are
working on joining serial sections, the state is saved instead to a
file with extension .ejf.&nbsp; The state file is updated whenever you
run a process, change process panels, or exit the program.&nbsp; If you
wish to save this file with a different name, use the <b>File/Save as</b>
menu item.&nbsp; Be aware that if you reopen an earlier version of the
.edf file you may get unpredictable results. <br>
</p>
<h2 class="western">Using Parallel Processing<br>
</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Two steps in
the processing can now be split into chunks and run in parallel on
multiple machines or processors: tomogram generation, and the final
stage of combining volumes in a dual-axis data set.&nbsp; This
capability is enabled if the machine on which you are running eTomo has
a configuration file called cpu.adoc located in the IMOD calibration
directory, which is /usr/local/ImodCalib by default.&nbsp; Run "man
cpuadoc" for a full description of how to set up such a file.&nbsp; A
two-line file is sufficient to use a single multiprocessor
system.&nbsp; Alternatively, you can enable parallel processing by
setting an environment variable IMOD_PROCESSORS to the number of
processors in the computer.&nbsp; For example, if you have 4 processors
and use tcsh for your shell, place <br>
&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">setenv IMOD_PROCESSORS 4</span><br>
in your .cshrc file, or if you use the bash shell, place<br>
&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">export IMOD_PROCESSORS=4</span><br>
in your .bashrc file.&nbsp; You
will also need to be able to log in via ssh without entering a password
(see below) and run IMOD on all of the other computers that you want to
use.&nbsp;
<br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">When parallel
processing is available, you will be able to select
whether to use it with checkboxes on the Tomogram Generation and the
Combination Final Match pages.&nbsp; With it selected, a parallel
processing table and controls will appear in the Process Monitor area
of the window.&nbsp; The table will show computers, their properties,
and their current loads.&nbsp; When you are ready to run the given
operation, select the computers and number of CPUs that you want to
use, then press the appropriate action button (e.g., <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Generate Tomogram</span>).&nbsp; The table
will show how many chunks are completed on each machine.&nbsp; The
parallel processing area includes several controls:<br>
</span></p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">The <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Kill</span> button, as usual, will kill all
running processes</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">The <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Pause</span> button will stop the
processing more gracefully by allowing all currently running chunks to
finish.</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">The <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Resume</span> button can be used after
either a Kill or a Pause to resume processing without having to redo
any
chunks that were already completed.</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">The <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Save as Defaults</span> button will save
your current selection of computers as the default for future sessions.</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">The <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Nice</span> control lets you select the
"niceness" of your jobs; the higher the value, the lower the
priority.&nbsp; The highest value is 19, which will compete with screen
savers, while a value of 0 will compete equally with normal interactive
usage of the machine.</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">The <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">+/-</span> button in the upper left can be
used to minimize the table.</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">The <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">&lt;/&gt;</span> button in the upper right
can be used to make the table smaller, so that it shows only the
selected computers and information needed while running.<br>
    </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="western"> </p>
<span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">To&nbsp; be able
to log in via ssh without a password, you need to generate ssh keys
that are present on each machine.&nbsp; First run <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-style: italic;">ssh-keygen
-t dsa</span><br>
<span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">and type Enter
for all of the queries.&nbsp; Then do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">cp
$HOME/.ssh/id_dsa.pub $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys2</span><br>
If necessary, distribute this authorized_keys2 file to the .ssh
directories on other machines that do not have the same home
directory.&nbsp; The three different kinds of platforms (Linux/Unix,
Mac OSX, Windows) may require separately generated keys.&nbsp; If this
seems
to be the case, run
ssh-keygen once on each type of machine then combine the
.ssh/id_dsa.pub files from each into one authorized_keys2 file.&nbsp;
Distribute this combined authorized_keys2 file to the .ssh directories.<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
</span>
<h1 class="western"><a name="Other_Interfaces"></a>Other Interfaces in
Etomo</h1>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">eTomo
provides a good framework for developing new interfaces for managing
parameter files and running processes, so we continue to add interfaces
for operations other than generating a tomogram.&nbsp; All of these
interfaces are available through the <span style="font-weight: bold;">File</span>
menu via the various selections starting with <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">New</span>.&nbsp; They include interfaces
for:<br>
</span></p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Joining
together tomograms from serial sections, opened by selecting <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">File/New Join</span>.&nbsp; See&nbsp;
the&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="tomojoin.html">Guide to Joining Tomograms</a>
for instructions.&nbsp; The processing state is saved to a file with
extension <span style="font-style: italic;">.ejf</span>, which you can
reopen to resume your work.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></span><br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Running
the PEET volume alignment and averaging software, opened by selecting <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">File/New PEET</span>.&nbsp; The processing
state is saved to a file with extension <span
 style="font-style: italic;">.epe</span>, which you can reopen to
resume working on a data set.</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Running
parallel processing on an appropriate set of command files, such as the
ones created by the programs <a href="man/chunksetup.html">chunksetup</a>,
    <a href="man/sirtsetup.html">sirtsetup</a>, and <a
 href="man/splitcorrection.html">splitcorrection</a>.&nbsp; This
interface is opened by selecting <span style="font-weight: bold;">File/New
Parallel Process</span> then pressing the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Generic Parallel Process</span>
button.&nbsp; The program state is saved in a file with extension<span
 style="font-style: italic;"> .epp</span>, which you can reopen to
process files with the same name as previously. <br>
    </span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Filtering
by nonlinear anisotropic diffusion.&nbsp; This procedure often requires
finding the right parameter settings with a small test volume before
running on the full volume, so the interface provides tools for doing
this conveniently.&nbsp; All of the temporary and working files are
kept in a subdirectory that you can remove at the end.&nbsp; The
interface is opened by </span><span
 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">selecting <span

bugs</h1>
<p class="western">We very much appreciate feedback from our
users; this includes bug reports, suggestions for enhancements and
general comments on what ideas or use models do or do not work.&nbsp;
eTomo itself is now mature enough so that it is often not initially
obvious to either you or us whether a problem is occuring because of
bug in eTomo, a bug in the rest of IMOD, or other difficulties with a
particular data set.&nbsp; To help diagnose problems, we have developed
a script, tomosnapshot, that will collect system information and
package up many of the small files that reflect the state of the
processing.&nbsp; The best way to run this is to cd to the directory
where the data are, start eTomo with the .edf file for the given data
set, repeat the series of actions that give the error (if this is
reasonably fast), then select the menu item <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">File/Run Tomosnapshot</span>.&nbsp; You can
then send the resulting tar file (setname-snapshot.tar.gz), along with
a description of what you did and the undesired result, to&nbsp;
David Mastronarde or Sue Held (see <a href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu">
web
site</a> for addresses).&nbsp; You can
also report bugs and make suggestions or comments by posting a message
on the IMOD mailing list at the University of
