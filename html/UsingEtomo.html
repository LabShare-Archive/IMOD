<P CLASS="western">eTomo provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to
the IMOD Tomography package. The general user interface design idea
on which eTomo is built is to present a separate panel for each
distinct step in computing a tomogram with the IMOD package. This
allows the user to focus on the current step in processing sequence,
presenting only the parameters and controls required for the current
step.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Starting eTomo</H2>
<P CLASS="western">eTomo can be started from the command line with
the command</P>

it may take a little while to come up, Java applications have a slow
startup time. You can also open up previous dataset buy specifying
the relative path to the .edf file on the command line, such as</P>

<H2 CLASS="western">The Setup Panel</H2>
<P CLASS="western">When eTomo is first started the <B>Setup Panel</B>
is shown, at this point you can either setup the processing for a new
tomogram or open one that was previously being worked on. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">To start working on a new dataset you need to fill
out the fields in the <B>Setup Panel</B>. 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">The <B>Dataset Name</B> is the name of the
	file containing the projection sequence (or the name of one of these
	files in the case of a dual axis tomogram). You can enter the
	<B>Dataset Name</B> by opening the file selection dialog window
	using the folder labeled button associated with the <B>Dataset Name</B>
	field. Alternatively, you may enter the relative path to the
	projection sequence file directly into the edit box.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">The <B>Backup Directory</B> is optionally
	available to save small working files every time you run a
	procedure. You can leave this field empty if you do not wish to use
	a backup directory.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Select the type of data you are working with
	in the <B>Data Type</B> panel.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Specify the pixel size, fiducial size and
	image rotation in the appropriate fields.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Specify the source for the tilt angles for
	either one or both axes, as appropriate. You can also optionally
	specify individual projections to exclude from the processing. The
	syntax for this exclude list is a comma separated list of range
	(i.e. 1,4-5,60-70)</P>
</UL>
<P CLASS="western">Press the <B>Create com scripts</B> button to move
on to generating the tomogram. You can also use an existing set of
com scripts by pressing the <B>Use existing coms</B> button, just be
sure that the setup parameters you have entered exactly match those
that were entered using <I>copytomocoms</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="western">To return to a previous tomogram, select the .edf
(eTomo Data File) file from the most recently used list on the bottom
of the File menu, or the Open... item on the File menu if the .edf is
not listed in the most recently used list. The file dialog will let
you navigate around to select the .edf file associated with the
tomogram you wish to work on.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">The Main Window</H2>
<P CLASS="western">The main window consists of several areas: on the
left is a column of buttons (<B>Process Control Buttons</B>) that
allow you to select the particular step of the tomogram computation
to work on, the top center is the <B>Process Monitor</B> that will
inform you of the status of the current process or the last process
completed and a button to kill the current process, the bottom status
bar presents some basic information about the dataset you are working
on. If you are working on a dual axis tomogram this layout will be
repeated for both the A and B axes.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The <B>Process Control Buttons</B> are arranged in
the suggested order of processing from top to bottom and are color
coded to signify the state of the process. Red indicates that the
process has not been started, magenta indicates that the process is
in progress, and green indicates that the process has been completed.
The state of the process is also indicated in text on the button.
When one of the buttons is selected the right side of the window will
fill in with information and fields associated with that process,
these forms are called <B>Process Panels</B>. They allow you to
modify the necessary parameters and execute the programs required by
that processing step. The parameters and buttons on each <B>Process
Panel</B> are typically laid out from top to bottom in the order they
should be executed. When you execute a process (by pressing a button
on one of the <B>Process Panels</B>) the <B>Process Monitor</B> will
indicate what the process is doing and when it is complete.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The text output of a particular process is written
to a log file named for the particular process, this log file can be
viewed by right clicking the mouse pointer over the window region
associated with the process. This will open a menu that is split into
three sections, the entries in the first section will open up the man
pages associated with the current process, the second section will
allow you to open up the log files associated with the current
process, the final menu section opens the general help documents.
There is more information regarding online help resources in the
section <A HREF="#Accessing Help|outline">Accessing Help</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="western">When you are done with all of the processes for a
given step press the <B>Done</B> button, this will inform eTomo that
the step is complete and will also move the GUI forward to the next
step in the tomogram processing. Pressing the <B>Postpone</B> button
will save all of the current parameters for that step and pressing
<B>Cancel</B> will abort all of the changes made since the last
process was run for that step. The final button of interest at the
bottom of most processing panels is the <B>Advanced</B> button. This
will present a much more complete list of parameters for each step,
which are mostly needed for unique or extreme cases.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Since the number of parameters that a particular
step requires can vary significantly, the amount of screen space the
GUI needs to present that information also changes. If the window is
too small to display the information scroll bars will appear so that
you can pan across the <B>Process Panel</B>. To fit the main window
tightly around the <B>Process Panel</B> the <B>Options/Fit Window</B>
menu item can be selected, this will resize the window appropriately.
If you are working on a dual axis tomogram there will also be a
divider between the information presented for each axis which can be
moved to give each axis the desired amount of screen area.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="Accessing Help|outline"></A>Accessing
Help</H2>
<P CLASS="western">One of the significant features of the eTomo GUI
is the immediate access to context sensitive online help. By context
sensitive we mean that the help being presented is specific to the
current processing problem at hand. Access to the online help is
available through two methods. The first, commonly know as Tooltips,
is accessed by leaving the mouse stationary over the parameter or
other GUI object of interest. This will pop up a short text
description of the parameter or function of the object. The object
being described can be changed by moving the mouse around or the
description can be removed by moving the mouse over a blank window
region. The description will also be dismissed (disappear) after a
short time if the mouse is not moved. Both the amount of time to
delay displaying the Tooltip and the amount of time to keep the
Tooltip visible can be set in the <B>Options/Settings</B> dialog.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The second method to access context sensitive help
is by right clicking the mouse over the processing region of
interest. This will open up a pop-up menu containing three sections.
The top section presents menu items that will open up a new window
containing the man pages appropriate for the current processing step.
The second section presents menu items that will open up the
appropriate log files for the current processing step. The final
section provides access to the Tomography Guide and Imod Guide. If
the Tomography Guide is selected the Guide will be opened up to the
section that is appropriate for the current processing step.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Saving Your Work</H2>
<P CLASS="western">To preserve your current position in the
processing and value of any parameters you entered or changed (that
are not saved in the underlying com scripts) you should save the
current state before exiting eTomo, either through the <B>File/Save</B>
or <B>File/Save as</B> menu items. If you attempt to exit and the
current state has not been saved a dialog box will prompt you if you
want to save the current data file. If you choose to save the current
state and have not already given the eTomo Data File a name you will
be prompted with a file dialog box to name to name the .edf file. In
selecting a name for your .edf file you do not need to add the .edf
extension, it will be added automatically.
