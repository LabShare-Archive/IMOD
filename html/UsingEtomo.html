    <h1 class="western"><a name="Usage"></a>Usage</h1>
    <p class="western">eTomo provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to the IMOD 
      Tomography package. The general user interface design idea on which eTomo is 
      built is to present a separate panel for each distinct step in computing a 
      tomogram with the IMOD package. This allows the user to focus on the current 
      step in the processing sequence, presenting only the parameters and controls 
      required for the current step.</p>
    <h2 class="western">Starting eTomo</h2>
    <p class="western">eTomo can be started from the command line with the command</p>
    <dl>
      <dd>
        <i>etomo</i>
        <dd style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0.5cm">
          <br>
          <br>
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <p class="western">
      It may take a little while to come up; Java applications have a slow startup 
      time. You can also open up a previous dataset by specifying the relative path 
      to the .edf file on the command line, such as</p>
    <dl>
      <dd style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0.5cm">
        <i>etomo path/to/dataset.edf</i></dd>
    </dl>
    <p class="western">
      <br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <h2 class="western">The Front Page and the Setup Panel</h2>
    <p class="western">When eTomo is first started, it shows its <b>Front Page</b>, 
      which contains a set of buttons for starting different kinds of interfaces (see 
      below). At this point you can either open a dataset that was previously being 
      worked on by selecting it from the recent file list in the <b>File</b> menu, or 
      you can use one of the buttons to open an interface for working on a new 
      dataset.
    </p>
    <p class="western">
      Selecting <b>New Tomogram</b> will bring up the tomogram <b>Setup Panel</b>.&nbsp; 
      To start working on a new dataset you need to fill out the fields in the <b>Setup 
        Panel</b>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="western">The <b>Dataset Name</b> is the name of the file containing the 
          projection sequence (or the name of one of these files in the case of a dual 
          axis tomogram). You can enter the <b>Dataset Name</b> by opening the file 
          selection dialog window using the folder labeled button associated with the <b>Dataset 
            Name</b> field. Alternatively, you may enter the relative path to the 
          projection sequence file directly into the edit box.</p>
      <li>
        <p class="western">The <b>Backup Directory</b> is optionally available to save 
          small working files every time you run a procedure. You can leave this field 
          empty if you do not wish to use a backup directory.</p>
      <li>
        <p class="western">Specify the pixel size, fiducial size and image rotation in 
          the appropriate fields.&nbsp; If the header of your image file includes pixel 
          size and/or image rotation information, press the
          <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Scan Header</span>
          button to extract these values.<br>
        </p>
      <li>
        <p class="western">Specify the source for the tilt angles for either one or both 
          axes, as appropriate. You can also optionally specify individual projections to 
          exclude from the processing. The syntax for this exclude list is a comma 
          separated list of ranges (i.e. 1,4-5,60-70)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="western">Press the <b>Create com scripts</b> button to move on to 
      generating the tomogram. You can also use an existing set of com scripts by 
      pressing the <b>Use existing coms</b> button; just be sure that the setup 
      parameters you have entered exactly match those that were entered using <i>copytomocoms</i>.</p>
    <p class="western">To return to a previous tomogram, select the .edf (eTomo Data 
      File) file from the most recently used list on the bottom of the File menu, or 
      the Open... item on the File menu if the .edf is not listed in the most 
      recently used list. The file dialog will let you navigate around to select the 
      .edf file associated with the tomogram you wish to work on.</p>
    <h2 class="western">The Main Window</h2>
    <p class="western">The main window consists of several areas: on the left is a 
      column of buttons (<b>Process Control Buttons</b>) that allow you to select the 
      particular step of the tomogram computation to work on, the top center is the <b>Process 
        Monitor</b> that will inform you of the status of the current process or the 
      last process completed and a button to kill the current process, the bottom 
      status bar presents some basic information about the dataset you are working 
      on. If you are working on a dual axis tomogram this layout will be repeated for 
      both the A and B axes.</p>
    <p class="western">The <b>Process Control Buttons</b> are arranged in the 
      suggested order of processing from top to bottom and are color coded to signify 
      the state of the process. Red indicates that the process has not been started, 
      magenta indicates that the process is in progress, and green indicates that the 
      process has been completed. The state of the process is also indicated in text 
      on the button. When one of the buttons is selected the right side of the window 
      will fill in with information and fields associated with that process; these 
      forms are called <b>Process Panels</b>. They allow you to modify the necessary 
      parameters and execute the programs required by that processing step. The 
      parameters and buttons on each <b>Process Panel</b> are typically laid out from 
      top to bottom in the order they should be executed. When you execute a process 
      (by pressing a button on one of the <b>Process Panels</b>) the <b>Process Monitor</b>
      will indicate what the process is doing and when it is complete.&nbsp; In many 
      cases, the button that you pressed will turn dark to indicate that the 
      operation has been completed.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="western">The text output of a particular process is written to a log 
      file named for the particular process; this log file can be viewed by right 
      clicking the mouse pointer over the window region associated with the process. 
      This will open a menu that is split into three or four sections: the entries in the 
      first section will open up the log files associated with the current
      process; some menus will have a second section with choices for plotting
      various kinds of information;
      the next section will allow you to open up man pages associated with the 
      current process; the final menu section opens the general help documents. There 
      is more information regarding online help resources in the section <a href="#AccessingHelp">
        Accessing Help</a>.</p>
    <p class="western">When you are done with all of the processes for a given step 
      press the <b>Done</b> button; this will inform eTomo that the step is complete 
      and will also move the GUI forward to the next step in the tomogram processing. 
      Pressing the <b>Postpone</b> button will save all of the current parameters for 
      that step and pressing <b>Cancel</b> will abort all of the changes made since 
      the last process was run for that step. If you move between process panels by 
      pressing the buttons in the left column, this will save the current parameters 
      just as a Postpone does.&nbsp; The final button of interest at the bottom of 
      most processing panels is the <b>Advanced</b> button. This will present a much 
      more complete list of parameters for each step, which are mostly needed for 
      unique or extreme cases.</p>
    <p class="western">Since the number of parameters that a particular step requires 
      can vary significantly,
      <span style="FONT-FAMILY: helvetica,arial,sans-serif"></span>the amount of 
      screen space the GUI needs to present that information also changes. The 
      current version of the program will adjust the window size automatically to fit 
      tightly around the <b>Process Panel </b>whenever you change screens or change 
      the amount of information displayed (such as by changing to advanced 
      mode).&nbsp; You make this fitting occur automatically by selecting the <b>Options/Fit 
        Window</b> menu item or using Ctrl-F hot key.&nbsp; Whenever the window is 
      too small to display the information, scroll bars will appear so that you can 
      pan across the <b>Process Panel</b>.&nbsp; To reduce the need for scrolling, 
      several of the large panels are divided into sections that can be opened or 
      closed independently with a button in the upper-left corner.&nbsp; This button 
      is initially "<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">-</span>" when the section is 
      open, and becomes "<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">+</span>" when the section 
      is closed.&nbsp; In addition, a<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"></span>
      button may appear in the upper right corner to allow a section to be switched 
      to advanced or basic mode independently of the others; this button will be 
      labeled
      <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">A</span>
      in basic mode and
      <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">B</span>
      in advanced.&nbsp;
      <br>
    </p>
    <p class="western">If you are working on a dual axis tomogram, each tomogram is 
      processed in a separate window.&nbsp; The upper left corner of the
      <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Axis A</span>
      window (or the
      <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Axis B</span>
      window, if it is the only one open) will have buttons to allow you to switch 
      between displaying one or the other axis or both axes.&nbsp; There are also hot 
      keys, Ctrl-A, Ctrl-B, and Ctrl-2, to display axis A, axis B, or both.
      <br>
    </p>
    <p class="western">Every process panel has one or more buttons for starting 3dmod 
      to display an image file.&nbsp; To make it easier to deal with very large 
      datasets and problems that require more control over the way that 3dmod is run, 
      there are two ways to make 3dmod load in images binned by 2 or to make it open 
      with its startup window, so that options can be selected.&nbsp; One way is to 
      right-click on one of these buttons, then select
      <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Open with
startup window</span>
      or
      <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Open binned
by 2.</span>&nbsp; The other way is to select the corresponding items in the
      <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Options</span>
      menu, which will make 3dmod open that way every time.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="western">For many processing steps, it is also possible to run the 
      operation and have the resulting images loaded into 3dmod automatically.&nbsp; 
      Right click on the button that starts the action (e.g., Generate Tomogram) and 
      menu will pop up with the choices
      <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">And open 3dmod</span>,
      <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">And open 3dmod with startup window</span>,
      <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">And open 3dmod binned by 2.<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&nbsp; </span></span>Select 
      the desired option to start the operation.<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><br>
      </span></p>
    <p class="western">It is possible to load more than one dataset into eTomo.&nbsp; 
      Under the
      <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">File</span>
      menu there are entries to open an existing dataset, open a new Setup window for 
      tomogram processing, or open a new window to setup joining serial 
      sections.&nbsp; If you start working on more than one dataset by any of these 
      routes, eTomo will place each dataset in a separate tab so that you can go 
      between them easily.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="western">The
      <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Options/Settings</span>
      dialog presents several configuration options, such as one to change the font 
      size being used, and one to switch to a compact display in which the buttons on 
      the left are very small.&nbsp; It may be necessary to close and reopen the 
      program to see options like these take full effect.<br>
    </p>
    <h2 class="western"><a name="ProjectLog"></a>The Project Log</h2>
    <P class="western">
      When you start processing a tomogram, a separate window will be opened called a 
      project log.&nbsp; This window will receive selected output from various 
      operations, and error messages that occur. You can also type your own notes 
      into the window.&nbsp; There is an entry under the View menu, and a hot key 
      Ctrl-L, for hiding or making it visible again.&nbsp; Even when it is hidden, 
      output will be saved to it.&nbsp; The contents are automatically saved to a 
      file named with the dataset name and "_project.log".
    </P>
    <h2 class="western"><a name="AccessingHelp"></a>Accessing Help</h2>
    <p class="western">One of the significant features of the eTomo GUI is the 
      immediate access to context sensitive online help. By context sensitive we mean 
      that the help being presented is specific to the current processing problem at 
      hand. Access to the online help is available through two methods. The first, 
      commonly know as Tooltips, is accessed by leaving the mouse stationary over the 
      parameter or other GUI object of interest. This will pop up a short text 
      description of the parameter or function of the object. The object being 
      described can be changed by moving the mouse around or the description can be 
      removed by moving the mouse over a blank window region. The description will 
      also be dismissed (disappear) after a short time if the mouse is not moved. 
      Both the amount of time to delay displaying the Tooltip and the amount of time 
      to keep the Tooltip visible can be set in the <b>Options/Settings</b> dialog.</p>
    <p class="western">The second method to access context sensitive help is by right 
      clicking the mouse over the processing region of interest. This will open up a 
      pop-up menu containing three sections. The top section presents menu items that 
      will open up a new window containing a log file appropriate for the current 
      processing step. The second section presents menu items that will open up the 
      appropriate man pages for the current processing step. The final section 
      provides access to the Tomography Guide, Serial Section Joining Guide, IMOD 
      Guide and the 3dmod Introduction. If the Tomography Guide is selected the Guide 
      will be opened up to the section that is appropriate for the current processing 
      step.&nbsp; All documentation is opened in the Qt Assistant, so that you can 
      follow hyperlinks and return from them, as well as have access to the full IMOD 
      documentation using the sidebar on the left.<br>
    </p>
    <h2 class="western">How Your Work Is Saved</h2>
    <p class="western">The current state of the processing and the value of any 
      parameters you entered or changed (that are not saved in the underlying com 
      scripts) are saved automatically to a file with the dataset name and the 
      extension .edf.&nbsp; If you are working on joining serial sections, the state 
      is saved instead to a file with extension .ejf.&nbsp; The state file is updated 
      whenever you run a process, change process panels, or exit the program.&nbsp; 
      If you wish to save this file with a different name, use the <b>File/Save as</b>
      menu item.&nbsp; Be aware that if you reopen an earlier version of the .edf 
      file you may get unpredictable results.
      <br>
    </p>
    <a name="Templates"></a>
    <h1 class="western">Using Templates<br>
    </h1>
    <p class="western">Default settings for many&nbsp;tilt series&nbsp;processing 
      parameters can be customized in files&nbsp;called template files.&nbsp;&nbsp;To 
      provide flexibility, eTomo is set up to work with&nbsp;three different levels 
      of template files, although there is no need to use all three.&nbsp; The three 
      levels are:
    </p>
    <UL>
      <LI>
        <p class="western"><STRONG>Scope template</STRONG>: These files&nbsp;are intended 
          to&nbsp;be used for parameters specific to a microscope, a combination of 
          microscope and camera, or perhaps a combination of microscope and some imaging 
          condition, such as voltage and spherical aberration for CTF correction, or 
          image distortion correction files.&nbsp; These files should be placed in a 
          subdirectory <EM>ScopeTemplate</EM> of the directory pointed to by the 
          environment variable <EM>IMOD_CALIB_DIR</EM>, which is <EM>/usr/local/ImodCalib</EM>
          by default.
        </p>
      <LI>
        <P style="Z-INDEX: 0" class="western"><STRONG>System template</STRONG>: These 
          files are meant to hold settings that are available to all users on the 
          system.&nbsp; eTomo will look for these files first in a subdirectory <FONT face="Courier New">
            <FONT face="Arial"><EM>SystemTemplate</EM> </FONT></FONT>under the installed 
          IMOD directory, then in a subdirectory SystemTemplate under the directory 
          pointed to by <EM>IMOD_CALIB_DIR</EM>.&nbsp; When eTomo sees a file with the 
          same name in latter location as in the IMOD directory, it ignores the one from 
          the IMOD distribution.Thus, if you want to customize&nbsp;a&nbsp;template 
          distributed with IMOD, you can modify&nbsp;it and save&nbsp;it with the same 
          name in the&nbsp;<EM>$IMOD_CALIB_DIR/SystemTemplate</EM> directory.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
      <LI>
        <P style="Z-INDEX: 0" class="western"><STRONG>User template</STRONG>: These files 
          hold settings for an individual user.&nbsp; eTomo will look for these files 
          in&nbsp;a directory <FONT face="Courier New">.etomotemplate</FONT>&nbsp;under 
          your home directory, and save them there from&nbsp;its template editor, but a 
          different location can be chosen in the
          <SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Options/Settings</SPAN>
          dialog.
        </P>
      </LI>
    </UL>
    <P style="Z-INDEX: 0" class="western">All template files must have the extension <EM>
        .adoc</EM>.&nbsp; Two system templates are distributed with IMOD.&nbsp; One 
      is <EM>plasticSection.adoc</EM>, which just turns on the use of a Sobel filter 
      to achieve better centering when tracking gold markers in the bead 
      tracker.&nbsp; The other is <EM>cryoSample.adoc</EM>, which also turns on the 
      Sobel filter centering but with an appropriate smoothing parameter, and has 
      some other settings that we have found appropriate for cryo-ET.&nbsp; One way 
      to see the settings in a template is to start a data set, select the template, 
      and create the com scripts.&nbsp; At this point you can select <STRONG>Templates/Save 
        System Template</STRONG> in the <STRONG>File</STRONG> menu (to see a system 
      template).&nbsp; The items in the existing template are all checked for 
      inclusion in a new template.&nbsp; You may have to check <STRONG>Show only 
        included</STRONG> to see just the items in the template.</P>
    <P style="Z-INDEX: 0" class="western">The template files form a hierarchy and are 
      considered in the order Scope - System - User, with later ones overriding 
      earlier ones.&nbsp; In other words, if the same&nbsp;parameter is found in more 
      than one template, the setting in the last template is the one that is used.</P>
    <P style="Z-INDEX: 0" class="western">The template editor can be used to save 
      template files containing&nbsp;any of the&nbsp;parameters&nbsp;supported in the 
      editor, but currently templates can be saved only from an actual data 
      set.&nbsp; The parameters are organized into sections corresponding to 
      different&nbsp;processing steps; there&nbsp;is a set of checkboxes that control 
      whether eahc section is open or closed.&nbsp; Whether a parameter&nbsp;is saved 
      is determined by the state of the&nbsp;<STRONG>Include</STRONG> checkbox to the 
      left of each&nbsp;entry.&nbsp; You can set these however you want, but the 
      state of the <STRONG>Includes</STRONG> when you first open it&nbsp;depends on 
      which kind of template you select to save.&nbsp; If you select to save a Scope 
      or System template, items will be checked for inclusion only if the data set 
      was started with a Scope or System template, respectively, and the items 
      checked will be the ones in that template.&nbsp; Other items shown grayed out 
      will be ones that&nbsp;eTomo thinks have changed&nbsp;since the data set was 
      started.&nbsp;&nbsp;The same applies if you&nbsp;go to save a User template 
      and&nbsp;started the data set with a&nbsp;User template.&nbsp; However, if no 
      User template was used, the program will shows items it thinks have changed and 
      select some items for inclusion based on how they are coded in a master file of 
      parameters, excluding ones in Scope or System templates.&nbsp; Unfortunately, 
      there are still numerous problems with the program's ability to tell whether an 
      item has changed.&nbsp; In particular, it will think almost everything has 
      changed for a data set started with a version of IMOD before 4.6.20, so it is 
      best to open this editor only with a recently started data set.</P>
    <P style="Z-INDEX: 0" class="western">The template editor is still under 
      construction;&nbsp;we plan changes that will make it&nbsp;clear whether a 
      parameter is contained in a lower-level template than the one being viewed, and

    <a name="ParallelProcessing"></a>
    <H1 class="western">Using Parallel Processing<br>
    </H1>
    <p class="western">Several steps in the processing can now be split into chunks 
      and run in parallel on multiple machines or processors, including CTF 
      correction, tomogram generation, and the final stage of combining volumes in a 
      dual-axis dataset.&nbsp; This capability is enabled if the machine on which you 
      are running eTomo has a configuration file called cpu.adoc located in the IMOD 
      calibration directory, which is /usr/local/ImodCalib by default.&nbsp; Run "man 
      cpuadoc" for a full description of how to set up such a file.&nbsp; A two-line 
      file is sufficient to use a single multiprocessor system.&nbsp; There are two 
      other alternatives when using a single system.&nbsp; First, you can open the
      <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Options/Settings</span>
      dialog<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"></span>, turn on
      <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Enable Parallel processing</span>, and then 
      fill in the number of CPUs.&nbsp; Second, you can enable parallel processing by 
      setting an environment variable IMOD_PROCESSORS to the number of processors in 
      the computer.&nbsp; For example, if you have 4 processors and use tcsh for your 
      shell, place
      <br>
      &nbsp;
      <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">setenv IMOD_PROCESSORS 4</span><br>
      in your .cshrc file, or if you use the bash shell, place<br>
      &nbsp;
      <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">export IMOD_PROCESSORS=4</span><br>
      in your .bashrc file.&nbsp; If you are using multiple machines, you will also 
      need to be able to log in via ssh without entering a password (see below) and 
      run IMOD on all of the other computers that you want to use.&nbsp;
      <br>
    </p>
    <p class="western">When parallel processing is available, you will be able to 
      select whether to use it with checkboxes on panels where it can be used.&nbsp; 
      With it selected, a parallel processing table and controls will appear in the 
      Process Monitor area of the window.&nbsp; The table will show computers, their 
      properties, and their current loads.&nbsp; When you are ready to run the given 
      operation, select the computers and number of CPUs that you want to use, then 
      press the appropriate action button (e.g.,
      <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Generate Tomogram</span>).&nbsp; The table will 
      show how many chunks are completed on each machine.&nbsp; The parallel 
      processing area includes several controls:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="western">The
          <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Kill</span>
          button, as usual, will kill all running processes</p>
      <li>
        <p class="western">The
          <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Pause</span>
          button will stop the processing more gracefully by allowing all currently 
          running chunks to finish.</p>
      <li>
        <p class="western">The
          <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Resume</span>
          button can be used after either a Kill or a Pause to resume processing without 
          having to redo any chunks that were already completed.&nbsp; If you press <STRONG>
            Pause</STRONG> in order to select a different set of CPUs, you can change 
          your CPU selection then press <STRONG>Resume</STRONG> without waiting for 
          running chunks to finish;&nbsp;processing will resume with the new set of CPUs 
          after those chunks finish.</p>
      <li>
        <p class="western">The
          <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Save as Defaults</span>
          button will save your current selection of computers as the default for future 
          sessions.</p>
      <li>
        <p class="western">The
          <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Nice</span>
          control lets you select the "niceness" of your jobs; the higher the value, the 
          lower the priority.&nbsp; The highest value is 19, which will compete with 
          screen savers, while a value of 0 will compete equally with normal interactive 
          usage of the machine.</p>
      <li>
        <p class="western">The
          <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">+/-</span>
          button in the upper left can be used to minimize the table.</p>
      <li>
        <p class="western">The
          <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&lt;/&gt;</span>
          button in the upper right can be used to make the table smaller, so that it 
          shows only the selected computers and information needed while running.<br>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="western">
      To be able to log in via ssh without a password, you need to generate ssh keys 
      that are present on each machine.&nbsp; First run
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">ssh-keygen
-t dsa</span><br>
      and type Enter for all of the queries.&nbsp; Then do<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">cp
$HOME/.ssh/id_dsa.pub $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys2</span><br>
      If necessary, distribute this authorized_keys2 file to the .ssh directories on 
      other machines that do not have the same home directory.&nbsp; The three 
      different kinds of platforms (Linux/Unix, Mac OSX, Windows) may require 
      separately generated keys.&nbsp; If this seems to be the case, run ssh-keygen 
      once on each type of machine then combine the .ssh/id_dsa.pub files from each 
      into one authorized_keys2 file.&nbsp; Distribute this combined authorized_keys2 
      file to the .ssh directories.<br>
      &nbsp;
      <br>
      In addition to being done on multiple processors, tomogram generation can now 
      be done on the graphics processing unit (GPU) of an NVIDIA graphics card. See 
      the <a href="guide.html#UsingGPU">IMOD User's Guide</a> for instructions on 
      setting up a machine to use the GPU. Reconstructions can also be done in 
      parallel using GPUs on several computers, although it is not yet possible to 
      use more than one GPU on a single computer.

    <p class="western">We very much appreciate feedback from our users; this includes 
      bug reports, suggestions for enhancements and general comments on what ideas or 
      use models do or do not work.&nbsp; It is often not initially obvious to either 
      you or us whether a problem is occurring because of bug in eTomo, a bug in the 
      rest of IMOD, or other difficulties with a particular dataset.&nbsp; To help 
      diagnose problems, we have developed a script, tomosnapshot, that will collect 
      system information and package up many of the small files that reflect the 
      state of the processing.&nbsp; This script is now able to collect files for all 
      of the kinds of projects that have a saved state (i.e, joining, PEET, NAD as 
      well as tomogram generation). The best way to run this is to cd to the 
      directory where the data are, start eTomo with the project file for the given 
      data set, repeat the series of actions that give the error (if this is 
      reasonably fast), then select the menu item
