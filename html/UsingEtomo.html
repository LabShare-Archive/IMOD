<h1 class="western"><a name="Usage|outline"></a>Usage</h1>
<p class="western">eTomo provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to
the IMOD Tomography package. The general user interface design idea
on which eTomo is built is to present a separate panel for each
distinct step in computing a tomogram with the IMOD package. This
allows the user to focus on the current step in the processing
sequence,
presenting only the parameters and controls required for the current
step.</p>
<h2 class="western">Starting eTomo</h2>
<p class="western">eTomo can be started from the command line with
the command</p>
<dl>
  <dd><i>etomo</i></dd>
  <dd style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm;"> <br>
    <br>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="western">
It may take a little while to come up, Java applications have a slow
startup time. You can also open up a previous dataset by specifying
the relative path to the .edf file on the command line, such as</p>
<dl>
  <dd style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm;"><i>etomo path/to/dataset.edf</i></dd>
</dl>
<p class="western">
<br>
<br>
</p>
<h2 class="western">The Setup Panel</h2>
<p class="western">When eTomo is first started the <b>Setup Panel</b>
is shown; at this point you can either setup the processing for a new
tomogram, open one that was previously being worked on, or open the
setup panel for joining tomograms from serial sections. </p>
<p class="western">To start working on a new dataset you need to fill
out the fields in the <b>Setup Panel</b>. </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="western">The <b>Dataset Name</b> is the name of the file
containing the projection sequence (or the name of one of these files
in the case of a dual axis tomogram). You can enter the <b>Dataset Name</b>
by opening the file selection dialog window using the folder labeled
button associated with the <b>Dataset Name</b> field. Alternatively,
you may enter the relative path to the projection sequence file
directly into the edit box.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="western">The <b>Backup Directory</b> is optionally
available to save small working files every time you run a procedure.
You can leave this field empty if you do not wish to use a backup
directory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="western">Specify the pixel size, fiducial size and image
rotation in the appropriate fields.&nbsp; If the header of your image
file includes pixel size and/or image rotation information, press the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Scan Header</span> button to extract these
values.<br>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="western">Specify the source for the tilt angles for
either one or both axes, as appropriate. You can also optionally
specify individual projections to exclude from the processing. The
syntax for this exclude list is a comma separated list of ranges (i.e.
1,4-5,60-70)</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="western">Press the <b>Create com scripts</b> button to move
on to generating the tomogram. You can also use an existing set of
com scripts by pressing the <b>Use existing coms</b> button; just be
sure that the setup parameters you have entered exactly match those
that were entered using <i>copytomocoms</i>.</p>
<p class="western">To return to a previous tomogram, select the .edf
(eTomo Data File) file from the most recently used list on the bottom
of the File menu, or the Open... item on the File menu if the .edf is
not listed in the most recently used list. The file dialog will let
you navigate around to select the .edf file associated with the
tomogram you wish to work on.</p>
<h2 class="western">The Main Window</h2>
<p class="western">The main window consists of several areas: on the
left is a column of buttons (<b>Process Control Buttons</b>) that
allow you to select the particular step of the tomogram computation
to work on, the top center is the <b>Process Monitor</b> that will
inform you of the status of the current process or the last process
completed and a button to kill the current process, the bottom status
bar presents some basic information about the dataset you are working
on. If you are working on a dual axis tomogram this layout will be
repeated for both the A and B axes.</p>
<p class="western">The <b>Process Control Buttons</b> are arranged in
the suggested order of processing from top to bottom and are color
coded to signify the state of the process. Red indicates that the
process has not been started, magenta indicates that the process is
in progress, and green indicates that the process has been completed.
The state of the process is also indicated in text on the button.
When one of the buttons is selected the right side of the window will
fill in with information and fields associated with that process;
these forms are called <b>Process Panels</b>. They allow you to
modify the necessary parameters and execute the programs required by
that processing step. The parameters and buttons on each <b>Process
Panel</b> are typically laid out from top to bottom in the order they
should be executed. When you execute a process (by pressing a button
on one of the <b>Process Panels</b>) the <b>Process Monitor</b> will
indicate what the process is doing and when it is complete.</p>
<p class="western">The text output of a particular process is written
to a log file named for the particular process; this log file can be
viewed by right clicking the mouse pointer over the window region
associated with the process. This will open a menu that is split into
three sections: the entries in the first section will open up the log
files associated with the current process; the second section will
allow you to open up man pages associated with the current
process; the final menu section opens the general help documents.
There is more information regarding online help resources in the
section <a href="#Accessing%20Help%7Coutline">Accessing Help</a>.</p>
<p class="western">When you are done with all of the processes for a
given step press the <b>Done</b> button; this will inform eTomo that
the step is complete and will also move the GUI forward to the next
step in the tomogram processing. Pressing the <b>Postpone</b> button
will save all of the current parameters for that step and pressing
<b>Cancel</b> will abort all of the changes made since the last
process was run for that step. If you move between process panels by
pressing the buttons in the left column, this will save the current
parameters just as a Postpone does.&nbsp; The final button of interest
at the
bottom of most processing panels is the <b>Advanced</b> button. This
will present a much more complete list of parameters for each step,
which are mostly needed for unique or extreme cases.</p>
<p class="western">Since the number of parameters that a particular
step requires can vary significantly, the amount of screen space the
GUI needs to present that information also changes. If the window is
too small to display the information scroll bars will appear so that
you can pan across the <b>Process Panel</b>. To fit the main window
tightly around the <b>Process Panel</b> the <b>Options/Fit Window</b>
menu item (hot key Ctrl-F) can be selected; this will resize the window
appropriately.
If you are working on a dual axis tomogram there will also be a
divider between the information presented for each axis which can be
moved to give each axis the desired amount of screen area.&nbsp; You
can display just one axis or the other with the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Options/Axis A</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Options/Axis B</span> menu items (hot keys
Ctrl-A and Ctrl-B).&nbsp; You can also select an option to have the
program adjust the window size automatically whenever you change
screens.&nbsp; Select the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Options/Settings</span>
menu item and check <span style="font-weight: bold;">Auto-fit</span>.<br>
</p>
<p class="western">It is possible to load more than one data set into
eTomo.&nbsp; Under the <span style="font-weight: bold;">File</span>
menu there are entries to open an existing data set, open a new Setup
window for tomogram processing, or open a new window to setup joining
serial sections.&nbsp; If you start working on more than one data set
by any of these routes, eTomo will place each data set in a separate
tab so that you can go between them easily.<br>
</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="Accessing Help|outline"></a>Accessing
Help</h2>
<p class="western">One of the significant features of the eTomo GUI
is the immediate access to context sensitive online help. By context
sensitive we mean that the help being presented is specific to the
current processing problem at hand. Access to the online help is
available through two methods. The first, commonly know as Tooltips,
is accessed by leaving the mouse stationary over the parameter or
other GUI object of interest. This will pop up a short text
description of the parameter or function of the object. The object
being described can be changed by moving the mouse around or the
description can be removed by moving the mouse over a blank window
region. The description will also be dismissed (disappear) after a
short time if the mouse is not moved. Both the amount of time to
delay displaying the Tooltip and the amount of time to keep the
Tooltip visible can be set in the <b>Options/Settings</b> dialog.</p>
<p class="western">The second method to access context sensitive help
is by right clicking the mouse over the processing region of
interest. This will open up a pop-up menu containing three sections.
The top section presents menu items that will open up a new window
containing a log file appropriate for the current processing step.
The second section presents menu items that will open up the
appropriate man pages for the current processing step. The final
section provides access to the Tomography Guide, Serial Section Joining
Guide, IMOD Guide and the 3dmod Introduction. If
the Tomography Guide is selected the Guide will be opened up to the
section that is appropriate for the current processing step.</p>
<h2 class="western">Saving Your Work</h2>
<p class="western">The current state of the
processing and the value of any parameters you entered or changed (that
are not saved in the underlying com scripts) are saved automatically to
a file with the dataset name and the extension .edf.&nbsp; If you are
working on joining serial sections, the state is saved instead to a
file with extension .ejf.&nbsp; The state file is updated whenever you
run a process, change process panels, or exit the program.&nbsp; If you
wish to save this file with a different name, use the <b>File/Save as</b>
menu item.&nbsp; Be aware that if you reopen an earlier version of the
.edf file you may get unpredictable results.&nbsp; <br>
