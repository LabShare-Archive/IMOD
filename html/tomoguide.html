<A NAME = "PRELIMINARIES"><H3>
PRELIMINARIES
</H3></A>
<A NAME = "Program Names"><H4>
Program Names
</H4></A>
In this document, program names are capitalized.  However, their true
names are all lower case, and they must be run by entering these names in
lower case because UNIX is case-sensitive.

<A NAME = "Command Files"><H4>
Command Files
</H4></A>
Nearly all of the processing for tomography is done by running command
files.  The format of these files was originally based on the batch files used
in VMS.  In our command files, every line that runs a command or program must
start with "$" or "%"; comments can be inserted anywhere in the file on lines
that start with "$!" or "#".  To skip over part of a command file, you can
insert the lines:
<PRE>
  $goto label             ("label" can be any label you choose)
  ...
  $label:                 (This must be on a line by itself)
</PRE>
     The program Vmstocsh converts a command file to a script that can be run
by the C shell, csh.  To run command files, put the following entry in your
.cshrc file if it is not already in the setup procedures that allow you to
run IMOD programs:
<BR><CODE>     alias subm 'vmstocsh <\!^:r.com \!^:r.log | csh -ef ; echo ^G&'
<BR></CODE>
 The ^G should be a CTRL-G to get a bell when the command file finishes.  You
could add "\!^ finished", (without the "") before the ^G to get a message
also.  With this alias, you can say, e.g., "subm track", and a file named
track.com will be executed in the background, a log file will be created
called track.log, and the bell will ring when the command file is completed.
You can also enter "subm track." or "subm track.com".
<P>
     The -ef flag after csh in the alias is important to make a command file
stop executing if one of the programs that it runs generates an error.
<P>
     If you need to interrupt a command file after you have started it, bring
it to the foreground with "fg", then used CTRL-C to interrupt it.  If there is
more than one process in the background, give the command "jobs" first to
determine which one is the process in question, then use, for example, "fg %2"
to bring job 2 to the foreground.

<A NAME = "Entries to Programs"><H4>
Entries to Programs
</H4></A>
The programs that you will run have many parameters or options to control
their behavior.  There are two basic ways to enter these options: as arguments
on the command line after the program name, and interactively in response to
queries from the program after it starts.  The first way follows the
conventions that are common for Unix commands, the most typical form being
<BR><CODE>    command [options] input_file output_file
<BR></CODE>
 The [ ] around "options" signifies that this is an optional entry; this is a
common convention when summarizing how to invoke a program.  Optional
arguments are usually single letters or abbreviations starting with a dash
(-).  Some options must be followed by another entry, which could be a
filename, a single number, or a list of numbers.  Other options stand on their
own, without an additional entry.  Command line entries are finicky in that
they require spaces separating all of the elements, including a space between
an option and its value, and no embedded spaces in the entries.  For example:
<BR><CODE>     newst -sec 0-7,13-21 -xf images.xg images.st images.ali
<BR></CODE>
 Here the -sec option is followed by a list of section numbers (with no
embedded spaces), the -xf option is followed by the name of file with
transformations in it, and the last two arguments are the names of the input
and output files.
<P>
A program that takes command line arguments will almost always print a
summary of its usage when you type in the program name with no arguments.
<P>
Programs that take entries interactively print out a query for an entry,
accept a line of input, then go on to the next entry.  In the command files
used to run the tomography software, the answer to each query will appear on a
separate line after the line on which such a program is invoked.  When you
look at the log file produced by running a command file, you will see all of
the queries but none of the entries, because the entries are not echoed into
the log file.
<P>
It may help to be aware of the underlying structure of the programs in
the IMOD package.  They are written in three languages: C, Fortran, and shell
script language.  The C programs take command line arguments.  Most of the
shell scripts also take command line arguments, the main exceptions being
Copytomocoms, Setupcombine, and Makejoincom, which take inputs interactively.
The Fortran programs, which are the predominant programs used for tomography,
take inputs interactively.  Some of them also take input and output filenames
on the command line, particularly ones which need no other entries (e.g.,
Header and Fftrans).
<P>
Fortran programs have several conventions for numeric input:
<OL>
<LI>When several numbers are expected in response to a query, they can be
separated by commas or spaces.  In addition, they can be entered on more than
one line.
<LI>A slash (/) at the beginning of a line will accept the default values
for all of the entries expected on that line.
<LI>When several numbers are being entered, specific values can be entered
for some of the numbers, followed by a slash to accept the defaults for the
rest of the entries (e.g., if 6 numbers are expected, 128,384/ will enter two
and accept the defaults for the other four).
<LI>Entering a comma without a number will accept the default for the
number expected before that comma (e.g., ,,,,128,384 will accept the defaults
for the first four numbers and enter values for the last two).
<LI>Once the program has received all the numbers that it is expecting, it
ignores the text on the rest of the line, as long as it is appropriately
separated from the last numeric entry (by a tab or space).  Command files take
advantage of this feature by having comments after numeric entries.
</OL>
<P>
Filename or other text entries do not follow these conventions for
numeric input, and cannot be followed by comments on the same line in the
command file.
<P>
Some Fortran programs accept lists of numbers for specific entries.
Lists are comma-separated ranges of numbers, such as 1,3,6-9,12-10, which
would enter the numbers 1,3,6,7,8,9,12,11,10.  Lists follow slightly different
conventions:
</OL>
<LI>A list must be confined to a single line (which can be 1024 characters
long).
<LI>A slash (/) at the beginning of the line will accept the default
values for the list (or leave a previous entry unmodified), but there is no
way to enter defaults for only some of the numbers in the list.
<LI>A character other than space, minus, comma, or a digit will terminate
the list; text after that character will be ignored, thus allowing comments
after lists.
</OL>

<A NAME = "Numbering System"><H4>
Numbering System
</H4></A>
You need to distinguish three numbering systems:
<OL>
<LI>The "section number" of a view is its physical location in file,
numbered from zero.  It is used when referring to sections within Cids or
<A HREF = "man/newstack.html">Newstack</A>.

<LI>The "Z value" of a view is what its section number would be in a file
arranged in order; it is also numbered from zero.  
These are the Z values in
a model of fiducial points.
<LI>The "view number" is the sequential number of the view in the tilt
series, starting from 1.  <A HREF = "man/beadtrack.html">Beadtrack</A>,
<A HREF = "man/tiltalign.html">Tiltalign</A>
and <A HREF = "man/tilt.html">Tilt</A>
refer to views by
"View number".
</OL>
<P>
Yes, this presents endless possibilities for confusion.  To reduce the
confusion, I'll at least refer to them consistently as "section number", "Z
value", and "view number". Before you start digitizing from film, it's a good
idea to write the section number and either the Z value or the view number on
the data sheets.  Then you can check for errors periodically as you digitize.
Note that when Cids says that N sections have been stored, the section number
of the last section stored is N-1 and N is the section number of the NEXT
section.

<A NAME = "Backup Files"><H4>
Backup Files
</H4></A>
     Nearly every program that you run will create a backup file if an output
file already exists, rather than simply deleting the old version of the output
file.  The existing file is renamed by adding a "~" at the end.  For example,
when you run track.com, an existing copy of track.log is renamed to
track.log~.  When you run the "newst" command given above, an existing copy of
image.ali would be renamed to image.ali~.  This can lead to some large
unneeded files if commands are run more than once.  It is helpful to have an
alias for purging backup files in your .cshrc: <BR><CODE> alias purge '\rm *~'
<BR></CODE>
 With this alias, "purge" will delete all backup files without asking for 
confirmation.

<A NAME = "NON-BOULDER NOTES"><H3>
NOTES FOR NON-BOULDER USERS
</H3></A>

<A NAME = "Film versus CCD Images"><H4>
Film versus CCD Images
</H4></A>
     Some of the programs make a distinction between images from film and ones
acquired on a CCD camera.  This is based on a virtually obsolete method of
digitizing from film, in which tilt images were already in good translational
and rotational alignment after being digitized.  In general, if your images
are already in fairly good alignment, treat them as data from "film"; whereas
if they will need a prealignment step, treat them as data from "CCD".


<A NAME = "Image Scaling"><H4>
Image Scaling and Contrast Polarity
</H4></A>
     Some of the programs and command files assume that the numbers in your
images are linearly related to the number of transmitted electrons caught
by the detector.  This is the case if images are recorded directly by CCD
camera or if film is digitized in optical density units.  The logarithm of
such values should then be proportional to projected mass density for imaging
dominated by amplitude (aperture) contrast.  Because of this, the command file
to run the backprojection program, <A HREF = "man/tilt.html">Tilt</A>,
contains an entry to take the log
of the numbers after adding a base value (which might correspond to the
fog level of film).  If your images are already mass-normalized, you should
remove the "LOG" entry in tilt.com; if your images are in arbitrarily scaled
units, you may need to remove that line or at least adjust the base value
that is added before taking the log.
<P>
     If electron density appears as white in your images, 
<A HREF = "man/beadtrack.html">Beadtrack</A> will
fail to track your fiducials properly with the default settings in track.com.
Simply change the entry on the line ending in "0 for dark beads" from 0 to 1
in track.com.

<A NAME = "Image File Header"><H4>
Image File Header
</H4></A>
The programs described here will work most reliably if the header in the
raw MRC image stack indicates that the "Pixel spacing" is 1,1,1 and the
"Origin" is 0,0,0.  If the stack is generated from files of another format
with
<A HREF = "man/Raw2mrc.html">Raw2mrc</A> or
<A HREF = "man/tif2mrc.html">Tif2mrc</A>, these conditions should be satisfied.  If the stack
is generated by other means, that may not be the case.  Check the header with:
<BR><CODE>     header filename
<BR></CODE>
 If you need to change the pixel spacing or origin, run:
<BR><CODE>     alterheader filename
<BR></CODE>
 enter "fixpixel" to fix the pixel size, enter "org" and 0,0,0 to fix the
origin, and enter "done" to rewrite the header and exit.


<A NAME = "ALIGNING IMAGES"><H3>
ALIGNING IMAGES AND GENERATING A TOMOGRAM
</H3></A>

<A NAME = "Getting Files"><H4>
Getting Command Files
</H4></A>
     There is a program to provide you with a complete set of command files
for your particular situation; just enter
<CODE><BR>     copytomocoms</CODE><BR>
 No command-line arguments are needed; the program will ask you a series of
questions about whether you have a tilt series about one axis or two, whether
the data are from CCD camera or film, etc.  The program works best if your
data files are already present in the directory where you will be working.
<P>
     Before you run Copytomocoms, you may need to decide how tilt angles will
be entered to <A HREF = "man/beadtrack.html">Beadtrack</A>,
<A HREF = "man/tiltalign.html">Tiltalign</A>, and
<A HREF = "man/tiltxcorr.html">Tiltxcorr</A>.
There are 3 ways to enter tilt angles: by giving a starting and increment
angle, by entering the list of all tilt angles into each command file, or by
placing the tilt angles in a separate file, one per line.  Data acquired on
the HVEM with
SerialEM have tilt angles in the file header, which Copytomocoms will offer to
extract
into a separate file for you.
Otherwise, if a tilt series
does not deviate from regular increments, the first way is fine; otherwise you
will have to decide between the other two ways.  For extensive tilt series,
it's easier to use a separate file;
you can probably find a nearly correct file in $IMOD_DIR/com.  A file
with raw tilt values should be named "setname.rawtlt".
<P>
     You will also need to make an entry for initial rotation angle.  This is
the angle from vertical to the tilt axis in the raw images (e.g., if the axis
runs from top left to bottom right, the angle would be 45 degrees).
If the tilt axis is already vertical,
enter a 0.  If the tilt axis is horizontal, enter 90 to have the aligned
images be rotated clockwise from their current orientation, or -90 to have
them rotated counterclockwise.  This will determine the orientation of the
resulting tomogram.
<P>
     You will also need to enter information about the size of gold fiducials.
You can enter the pixel size and size of gold particles in nanometers, or just
the size of the particles in pixels.
<P>
     For a single tilt series from film, you will get copies of 7 command
files:
<UL>
<LI> track.com     runs <A HREF = "man/beadtrack.html">Beadtrack</A>
to generate a fiducial model
<LI> newst.com     runs <A HREF = "man/newstack.html">Newstack</A>
to make a floated or aligned stack
<LI> align.com     runs <A HREF = "man/tiltalign.html">Tiltalign</A>
to get the alignment
<LI> tilt.com      runs <A HREF = "man/tilt.html">Tilt</A> to generate a tomogram or slices thereof
<LI> sample.com    runs <A HREF = "man/newstack.html">Newstack</A> and the
<A HREF = "man/tilt.html">Tilt</A> command file on three regions 
<LI> findsec.com   runs <A HREF = "man/findsection.html">Findsection</A>
to help find the section
<LI> tomopitch.com runs <A HREF = "man/tomopitch.html">Tomopitch</A>
 to find the pitch of the section from models
</UL>
<P>
     If you have montaged files, you will get a blend.com instead of
newst.com.  This runs <A HREF = "man/blendmont.html">Blendmont</A>,
 as will the sample.com.  If the overlap
between pieces was not very accurate when you digitized, you can choose to get
a preblend.com to make an initial correction of these misalignments.
<P>
     For a tilt series from a CCD camera, you will get two or three more
files:
</UL>
<LI> eraser.com     runs <A HREF = "man/ccderaser.html">Ccderaser</A>
 to erase bad spots in the image
<LI> xcorr.com      runs <A HREF = "man/tiltxcorr.html">Tiltxcorr</A>
 to get an initial alignment by correlation
<LI> prenewst.com   runs <A HREF = "man/xftoxg.html">Xftoxg</A> and 
<A HREF = "man/newstack.html">Newstack</A> to get a temporary pre-aligned stack
</UL>
<P>
     Finally, if you have montaged with SerialEM, you will get preblend.com
instead of prenewst.com and blend.com instead of newst.com.
<P>
     If you have a two-axis tilt series, you will get one copy for each
series, with names ...a.com and ...b.com.
For convenience, most command files will be referred to
below by a name without an "a" or "b" (e.g., track.com), but in practice you
will always be running an "a" or "b" version when you have a dual tilt series.
<P>
     The man pages for the programs run by these command files give full
details on their operation and on the meaning of the entries to each.  Consult
them for any questions on the options available in these programs.
<P>
     Copytomocoms fetches the command files from $IMOD_DIR/com.  If 
something goes wrong, you can copy files from there manually.


<A NAME = "Using Insecure Storage"><H4>
Using Temporary or Insecure Storage
</H4></A>
     It is possible to have your small working files automatically saved to
another directory every time that you run a command file.  This will provide
backup protection if you build tomograms in a disk area that is not regularly
backed up.  To use this feature, first be sure that the directory where you
will do your work and the directory where files should be saved both exist.
Run Copytomocoms from the directory where you will build the tomogram.  When
it asks about a directory to save small files into for backup protection,
enter the path to that directory.  If your raw stacks are not located in the
current directory, the program assumes that they are in the backup directory
instead, and creates links to them from the current directory.  In this way,
you can work in this directory just as you would in the original directory,
without having to copy or move the raw stacks.  However, you may choose to
copy the raw stacks to the working directory if this gives significantly
faster access.
     After every command file is run, the script "savework" will be run
automatically, copying files over to the source directory.  You can also run
"savework" yourself at any time (for example, after working on a fiducial
model for a while).


<A NAME = "Preliminary Steps"><H4>
Preliminary Steps for Images from a CCD Camera
</H4></A>
<P>
     1) If necessary, convert files from Digital Micrograph to a single MRC
stack with Dm2mrc.
<P>
     2) If there are extreme low or high values in your data file which ruin
the contrast when you read the images into imod, you should wipe them out with
<A HREF = "man/ccderaser.html">Ccderaser</A>,
 which is run by eraser.com.  See the man page for Ccderaser for
details on how to specify the pixels to erase in a model file, which should be
named "setname.erase".  If the image stack is your only copy of the data, you
might want to have <A HREF = "man/ccderaser.html">Ccderaser</A>
 make a new output file, and examine that file
before replacing the original stack with the erased file.  To do so, add a
filename for such an output file in eraser.com.
<P>

     3) Get a prealignment using cross-correlations.  There is one option to
decide on in xcorr.com.  If your images are noisy and the camera did not do a
good gain-normalization, then cross-correlation may find a spurious peak near
zero instead of the real alignment.  If this happens with your data, change
the entry on the line "to exclude central peak due to fixed pattern noise" to
1.  However, select this option only if you must, because with this option,
the program will give an incorrect alignment for pairs of images that are
already within a few pixels of being perfectly aligned.
<P>

     4) Check the alignment by running prenewst.com and looking at the
prealigned stack (setname.preali), or by running 
<A HREF = "man/midas.html">Midas</A> and quickly looking at
each pair of images in turn.

<P>
     5) If there are serious alignment errors, run 
<A HREF = "man/midas.html">Midas</A>.  The image file is
the raw image stack setname.st, and the transform file to edit is
setname.prexf.
<P>
     6) After fixing bad transforms with <A HREF = "man/midas.html">Midas</A>,
 run prenewst.com.

<A NAME = "Montage Preliminary"><H4>
Preliminary Steps with Montaged CCD Images
</H4></A>

     If you have montaged images, the last three steps are a little different.
First, the xcorr.com file makes a blended image of up to 1024 pixels in size
to find the initial alignment.  This file is setname.bl.  If you need to use
<A HREF = "man/midas.html">Midas</A>,
 run it on this file rather than on setname.st.  Finally, you use
preblend.com instead of prenewst.com to get the prealigned stack.
<P>
     With montaged images, you should always check xcorr.log to see how well
<A HREF = "man/blendmont.html">Blendmont</A>
was able to shift pieces into proper registration.  For each section
in the file, you will see a line giving the "mean, max error before ... after
...".  These errors are the amounts of image displacement that 
<A HREF = "man/blendmont.html">Blendmont</A> thinks
are present in the overlap zones between adjacent pieces of the montage.  The
error before shifting the pieces around will generally be large.  The error
after pieces have been shifted into optimal registration should be small, less
than 0.5 pixels.  If it is large, then 
<A HREF = "man/blendmont.html">Blendmont</A> was probably not able to
measure one or more image displacements accurately enough.  If this happens,
you can adjust the measured image displacements by hand with 
<A HREF = "man/midas.html">Midas</A>.  You
should definitely do this for a section whose maximum error exceeds 1, and
consider it for sections with maximum errors greater than 0.5.  
<P>
     To fix displacements in 
<A HREF = "man/midas.html">Midas</A>, enter:
<BR><CODE>    midas -p setname.pl setname.st setname.ecd </CODE><BR>
 Select the Interpolate toggle button to visualize sub-pixel shifts properly.
Enter the section number of a section with a large error in the Current
Section text box.  The control panel has push-buttons for the four edges with
the worst errors; use these to select the edge with the worst error.  Toggle
between the two pieces to visualize the registration in the overlap zone.  If
it looks bad, shift the Current piece into alignment (the Apply Leave-out
Error button can be a useful shortcut if this is the only piece with an error
-- see the 
<A HREF = "man/midas.html">Midas</A>
 man page for explanation.)  If the overlap looks fine, simply
go on to another edge; you will probably find the error there.  This
potentially confusing situation may be quite frequent, because whenever a bad
edge involves a corner piece of the montage, its error is spread equally
between the two edges of that piece.  It will thus look like there are two
equally bad edges when only one is bad.
<P>
     After you correct the displacement at an edge, the push-buttons will
rearrange and show new maximum errors.  Once the maximum error is down to 0.3,
you can go on to another section.  When you are done, save the edge
correlation displacement file and exit.  Your corrected displacements will
automatically be used when 
<A HREF = "man/blendmont.html">Blendmont</A> is run again.
However, you should have
<A HREF = "man/blendmont.html">Blendmont</A>
build new edge functions on its next run, because the edge functions depend
partly on the displacements that you just modified.  To do this, modify
preblend.com by changing the 1 to a 0 on the line "0 build new/1 read old 
edge function files."<P>
     It is important to correct these displacements before building the
prealigned stack and modeling fiducials on it.  When displacements are
changed, image positions in the blended image change as well.  If you have
already modeled fiducials before correcting displacements, you should check
the positions of all model points on the sections that were fixed.
<P>
     If you have a montage consisting of a single row or a single column, the
reported errors are all zero, even if there are incorrect displacements.  If
you suspect that there is a problem with some overlaps (for example, at high
tilt in a horizontal montage), your only recourse is to examine each edge in
turn in 
<A HREF = "man/midas.html">Midas</A>.


<A NAME = "Getting Fiducial"><H4>
Getting a Fiducial Model
</A></H4>
     The first step is to set up a seed model.  Run
 <A HREF = "man/imod.html">Imod</A> on the stack (using
the piece list) and pick a view near zero tilt that has good images of the
beads.  Put one point exactly in the center of each desired bead (zoom up to 3
or 4 to do this accurately).  Each bead should be in a separate contour;
<A HREF = "man/beadtrack.html">Beadtrack</A>
 will try to extend each contour through the tilt series.  Beads too
close to the edges are not trackable by 
<A HREF = "man/beadtrack.html">Beadtrack</A> but could be tracked by hand
if necessary.  Try to have at least 8 beads well distributed over the area.
The more beads you have, the better the alignment will be, up to a point, but
the longer it will take to run.  If the beads are all on one surface, there is
not much point in having more than 12 or so; if they are on both surfaces, 20
or more may be useful.  Save the model with the extension ".seed".
<P>
     If you are doing a double-tilt series, at least some (8-10) of the beads
that you track must be the same in the two series.  In the simplest cases, you
can run <A HREF = "man/imod.html">Imod</A>
 on both stacks at once and add the beads in the same order in the
two models.  This can be burdensome if you are tracking many beads or if the
density of beads is high.  In these cases, you can make sure that the first 5
beads correspond between the two series, then add the rest in any order.  If
you do this, then when you prepare to combine the two tomograms, you would
specify that only the first 5 beads correspond.  If there are beads on both
surfaces, be sure to include at least one bead from each surface of the
section in this initial subset.
<P>
     <A HREF = "man/beadtrack.html">Beadtrack</A>
 proceeds from one view to the next, tracking as many beads as
possible on the new view.  Once it has bead positions on enough views, it runs
a simplified tilt alignment to get improved predictions of where beads should
be and to reject erroneous positions.  Thus, there are several entries to
<A HREF = "man/beadtrack.html">Beadtrack</A>
 that are the same as ones needed for 
<A HREF = "man/tiltalign.html">Tiltalign</A>.
<P>
     Most standard entries to <A HREF = "man/beadtrack.html">Beadtrack</A>
 should work well.  The radius for
determining the center of gravity of gold particles is set to the actual
radius plus 1.5 pixels, based on the entries that you made to Copytomocoms.
Make the following changes to track.com:
<OL>
<LI>      Enter a list of views to be skipped over.  Skip over a view if
there is a big mag change for that view only, or a particularly poor image for
that view.
Typically you would leave this entry blank on a first run and enter a Z value
here for a second run if the program fails to track accurately through that
view.
<LI>      Specify the views that should be kept out of groupings with adjacent
views ("reshoots" or other views that don't match the surrounding ones for
some reason).  Put the number of series of reshoots
(typically 1) on the line "# of sets of reshoots", then put the
list of VIEW NUMBERS for each series on a separate line.  
<LI>      If you have a sudden lurch in tilt angles or in magnification, you may
need to change the grouping of tilt or mag variables to avoid having these
variables grouped across the discontinuity.
<LI>      If you have finer that 1.5 degree tilts, you may need to increase the
minimum number views for doing tilt alignment.
<LI>      If you have partially tracked a bead in the seed model and left a gap
because of ambiguity, you should set the entry for "fill in gaps" to 0.
</OL>
<P>
     Run the command file.  You can examine the log file to see how well the
tilt alignment did, but the program will end with a summary of which beads
could not be tracked completely.  To see this, use
<BR><CODE>     tail -40 track.log</CODE><BR>
 If several beads fail to track past a particular view, you might want to
add that view to the list of views to be skipped and rerun the tracking.
<P>
     At this point, read the new model into <A HREF = "man/imod.html">Imod</A>
and activate the Bead Fixer
plugin under the "Special" menu.  This will allow you to jump from one gap in
the data to the next and fill in missing points if appropriate.  It is
acceptable for some of the points to be missing on some of the views.  If too
few of the points can be extended all the way to the first or last views, you
can add some fiducials that are present only in higher tilt views.  Just be
sure to add them on a substantial number of views, not just on a few, so that
their 3-D positions can be solved for accurately.  If you do need to add
several fiducials, you could put some "seeds" into your edited fiducial model
and allow Beadtrack to track those beads as far as possible.


<A NAME = "Running Tiltalign"><H4>
Running Tiltalign
</A></H4>
     Whether you have fiducials on one surface or two determines what
variables can be solved for.  If there are beads on only one surface, you can
solve for either tilt angles or stretch in the X direction but not both.  If
there are beads on both surfaces, you can solve both for tilt angles and for
distortion, or for tilt angles and compression, but not for all three kinds of
variables.
<P>
     You should first run <A HREF = "man/tiltalign.html">Tiltalign</A>
 with all tilt angles variable and no
distortion; this will reveal bad fiducials, check for switched views and
reveal some sudden changes in alignment that may need to be taken into account
when grouping views together.  After fixing fiducials, include distortion and
group the tilt angles as appropriate.  
<P>
     For your first run, modify the align.com file as follows:
<OL>
<LI> Put in the lists of reshoots.  Put the number of series of reshoots
(typically 1) on the line "# of separate sets for automapping", then put the
list of VIEW NUMBERS for each series on a separate line.
<LI> Set "the # of the reference view..." to the number of the view that
was shot first on the microscope.  Be sure not to have a reshoot as the
reference view.
<LI> Change the entry for surface analysis to 1 or 2 if there are beads on
one or two surfaces.
</OL>
<P>
     Run the alignment and examine the solution.  The program 
<A HREF = "man/alignlog.html">Alignlog</A> can be
used to extract particular sections of the lengthy log file.  You may want to
look at some of the fiducials with the largest errors, particularly ones with
errors greater than 2 pixels.  Adjust point positions in the model, if
appropriate.  The Bead Fixer plugin allows you to look easily at the points
with the greatest error.
<P>
     Every time you run <A HREF = "man/tiltalign.html">Tiltalign</A>,
 it will analyze the bead positions and
recommend a change in tilt angles that would make the beads lie in a
horizontal plane.  Make this change before the next run of 
<A HREF = "man/tiltalign.html">Tiltalign</A>.
<P>
     In the section of <A HREF = "man/tiltalign.html">Tiltalign</A>'s
 output where it reports parameters for each
view, the last column ("mean resid") shows the mean error (residual) for all
of the points on each particular view.  This information will reveal whether
some views give a poorer fit than others.

<A NAME = "Background Grouping"><H4>
Background on Grouping Variables and Solving for Distortion
</A></H4>
     Examine the tilt angles, looking for places where they change by unusual
amounts.  The column labeled "deltilt" shows the difference between the solved
tilt angle and the original, nominal tilt angle.  This column should change
gradually (except at reshoots), with a local variability of 0.1 to 0.2
degrees.  Low tilt angles cannot be solved for as accurately, so variability
might be somewhat greater there, but should not be much greater.
<P>
     Before you get into trying to solve for distortion and grouping
variables, you should be aware of several points.  First, the grouping of
variables can be done in two different ways.  In one way, the particular
parameter will change linearly from the first view in one group to the first
view in the next group, and will appear to change smoothly over the whole tilt
series.  This is referred to as linear grouping or linear mapping.  In the
other way, all of the views that are grouped will have exactly the same value
for the particular parameter (except tilt angle, where the grouped views will
differ from each other by fixed amounts).  This is referred to as mapping in
blocks.  For every variable except stretch along the X-axis, linear mapping
is now the "default", selected by the option number that you will find in the
command file, because it gives a slightly better fit to typical data.  In
each case, mapping in blocks can be selected by increasing the option number
by one (typically, from 3 to 4).
<P>
     The second point concerns the nature of the distortion solution, a
strange beast.  Even if the only thing happening to the section is a stretch
along the X-axis, solving for distortion will successfully account for these
changes, but the resulting solution will not numerically reproduce the
amount of stretch.  The problem is that there is an infinity of equivalent
solutions, which all account for the distortion equally well, but differ in
the geometry of the resulting reconstruction.  This geometric difference is a
"strain", a shifting in Z proportional to the X value of a column of
pixels.  Without additional information about the section, there is no way to
recover its true structure, and the actual amount of stretching that occurred.
The program needs to pick one solution out of the equivalent ones, and it does
so by eliminating one variable; thus you will notice a variable listed as
"dummy" in the <A HREF = "man/tiltalign.html">Tiltalign</A>
 log file.  Typically, this arbitrarily selected
solution will change the most at high tilt angles, sometimes dramatically so,
even though the actual changes in the section happen at a nearly constant rate
through the series.
<P>
     The distortion solution will also account for thinning when tilt angle is
allowed to vary as well.  The equations governing this situation dictate that
the X-axis stretch change rapidly at the highest tilts, even if thinning
occurs at a regular rate through the series.  Thus, regardless of whether
there is section distortion or thinning, or both, it is almost inevitable that
the X-axis stretch will change most rapidly at high tilt.
<P>
     The third point to be aware of is that group sizes will vary with tilt
angle when using linear mapping.  Group size for tilt angle will be
proportional to the cosine of the angle, and will be set so that the average
size equals the value that you specify for grouping.  Because of the peculiar
behavior of the X-axis stretch, its group size will change even more with tilt
angle.
<P>
     Finally, be aware that including distortion can lead the program into
inappropriate solutions, in which the tilt angle and the X-axis stretch covary
excessively.  This can occur when there are too few fiducials, too great an
imbalance between the number of fiducials on the two surfaces, substantial
random errors in the locations of the model points, or a ratio of measurements
to unknowns that is too low.  The potential remedies are to increase group
sizes, switch from linear grouping to grouping in blocks, solve only for skew
angle, or give up on solving for distortion.

<A NAME = "Distortion Two"><H4>
Solving for Distortion - Fiducials on Both Surfaces
</A></H4>
     If you have fiducials on both surfaces, make the following changes to
include distortion:
<OL>
<LI> Change the entry for "0 fixed, 1/2/3 all vary..." to 5 for
automapping.
<LI>      Uncomment the following line to specify the tilt angle grouping;
for example, "10,0" will
combine tilt angles for sets of 10 views at a time.
<LI>      Change the entry for "distortion" to 2, to allow stretch and skew to
be mapped differently.
<LI>      Uncomment the lines for the stretch variable: 3 for automapping,
then a default group size and 0 on the following line (use a group size of 5
to 10).
<LI>      Uncomment the lines for the skew variable: 3 for automapping,
then a default group size and 0 on the following line (use a group size of 7
to 15).
</OL>
<P>
     You would want to pick the low end of these ranges of group sizes if an
alignment run reveals that one of the distortion variables changes especially
quickly (but don't be fooled by big changes for reshoots).  Conversely, if the
ratio of measurements to unknowns is lower than 10-12, you would want to make
the default group sizes large.  Start with the values that come in the command
file.
<P>
    The stretch variable ("dmag") will typically range from 0.001 to 0.02 but
can easily reach 0.05 at high tilts.  If you get values larger than 0.05, or
if you get changes in tilt angle ("deltilt") more than 2 degrees,  you
should increase the group size and see if the range of values decreases,
particularly if you have only 3-5 fiducials on the surface with fewer
fiducials.  If the range decreases substantially, stick with the larger group
size.  You can also increase the grouping for skew and tilt angles to try
to get a better-behaved solution.  If a solution seems unreasonable, either
abandon the attempt to solve for distortion, or solve for skew angle only, as
described in a few paragraphs.
<P>
     The skew is an angle in degrees and will typically range from 0 to 1
degrees.  Values greater than about 0.2 degrees are worth correcting for, and
a change of more than about 0.3 degrees from one group to the next would be a
big change.
<P>
     If you have discovered that there is some sudden change in alignment such
that two views should not be grouped together, then you need to specify some 
"separate ranges" for each of these entries.  Suppose there is a big change
between views 20 and 21.  Then, for automapping the tilt angles, you would
use "10,1" to specify default grouping of 10 and 1 separate range, then you
would add a line with "1,20,10", so that views from 1 to 20 would be grouped
separately with a group size of 10.  Make similar entries for the distortion
variables.
<P>
     A good alignment has a mean error of 0.25 to 0.5 pixels, or more for
larger gold particles.

<A NAME = "Distortion One"><H4>
Solving for Distortion - Fiducials on Only One Surface
</A></H4>
     If you have fiducials on only one surface, you can't properly solve for
both tilt angle and distortion.  If the section has thinned but not distorted,
then allowing the tilt angles to vary will correct for the thinning.  If the
section has distorted but not thinned, then solving for distortion with fixed
tilt angles is appropriate.  In reality, both phenomena occur, and section sag
and goniometer error make the tilt angles inaccurate so that fixing them
completely is almost always problematic.  In any event, you should first try
solving for distortion and grouping the tilt angles in large groups (20 to
30).  Make the changes described above with grouping of tilt angle by 25,
stretch by 10 and skew by 15.  Run the alignment.  Be very careful before
accepting these results - it is possible for tilt angle and stretch to
compensate for each other and give an artifactual solution.  This would show
up particularly on reshoots - if their tilt angles are far off from the value
expected from the adjacent views, don't trust the result.  Instead, do one of
the following:
<OL>
<LI> If skew is not significant (say, less than 0.25 degrees), then don't
solve for distortion, and set the group size for tilt angles at 5-10.

<LI> If skew is significant, there are two options.  One is to fix all tilt
angles and continue to solve for distortion, perhaps reducing the group size
accordingly.  The other is to solve for tilt angles, and for skew angles, but
not for stretch.  This is done by setting the option for X-axis stretch to 4
instead of 3, and the group size for stretch to -200 (a number larger than the
number of views, and negative so that reshoots will be fixed as well).  You
can then group tilt angle and skew by 5-10.
</OL>

<A NAME = "Using Local Alignments"><H4>
Using Local Alignments
</A></H4>

     If you are reconstructing a large area, particularly if you are
montaging, then you may need to solve for local tilt alignments to get the
same quality of alignment and resulting resolution as you would with a smaller
area.  In order to do so, you will need about 6-8 fiducials per 500 by 500 
pixel area digitized from film, or 8-12 fiducials per 1000 by 1000 pixel area 
acquired with the CCD camera on the HVEM.
<OL>
<LI> Find a global solution using all of the fiducials, as described above.
Because you have many fiducials, you can make the grouping of variables for
tilt angles and distortion smaller than usual.  Reduce group sizes accordingly
but keep the ratio of measurements to unknowns fairly high (~15).
<LI> If you did not indicate that you might need to do local alignments when
you ran Copytomocoms, then you need to add entries to your align.com.  First
add a line at the end specifying the file in which to place the local
alignments, typically setnamelocal.xf.  The append the contents of the file
$IMOD_DIR/com/localpart.com.
<LI> Change the entry from 0 to 1 on the line "0 to exit, or 1 to do local
alignments".
<LI> Adjust the entries for number of local areas and area sizes so that
there will be an overlap of about 40-50% between local areas.  For data from
film, a size of 500 pixels is appropriate, but a size of 750-800 pixels is
probably better for unbinned data from the CCD camera.  To have an overlap of
40%, allow 300 pixels per area for film, or 450 pixels for CCD data, and
divide the total size in one dimension by 300 or 450 to obtain the desired
number of areas in that dimension.  For example, with 500-pixel areas, a 1500
by 2000 pixel data set should have 5 by 7 local areas.
</OL>
<P>
     Run align.com and examine the results.  You can assess the results easily
with:
<BR><CODE>
     grep Residual align.com
<BR></CODE>
 The typical result has been that a global mean residual of 0.75-1 is reduced
to about 0.5 in the local alignments.

<A NAME = "Getting Trial"><H4>
Getting a Trial Aligned Stack and Tomogram
</A></H4>
     To obtain a sliver of an aligned stack, run newst.com for a non-montaged
set or blend.com for a montaged one.  Edit these files (the size entry in a
newst.com file, or the min and max Y values in a blend.com file) if you want a
sliver bigger than 10 pixels.  After the first time that you run blend.com,
you need to edit and change the entry for "build new edge function files" from
0 to 1, unless you have run a preblend.com.  Set this entry to 1 for every run
thereafter.
<P>
     After you obtain and examine an aligned stack, modify the tilt.com file
as follows:
<OL>
<LI> Set the thickness to at least twice the expected thickness of the
section in the tomogram.
<LI> Set the cutoff value and sigma value for the filter on the "RADIAL"
line as appropriate for the resolution of your tomogram.  These should be
entered in reciprocal pixels (values from 0 to 0.5) so that the filter setting
will not depend on the size of the image.
<LI> The entry on the LOG line should be 5000 times the approximate fog OD
level for film, but must be 0 for images from CCD camera.
<LI> For extra speed, or if your aligned stack is bigger than 10 in Y, add
a line "slice 1 5 1" to do just 5 slices.
</OL>
<P>
     Examine the tomogram piece in cross-section with 
<A HREF = "man/imod.html">Imod</A>.  You will see that
you need to shift the section up or down.  If you can't see both surfaces of
the section, either rerun <A HREF = "man/tilt.html">Tilt</A>
 with a bigger thickness, or make a large entry
to "move the tilt axis in Z" in the align.com file (positive moves the section
up in the tomogram).  Then rerun <A HREF = "man/tiltalign.html">Tiltalign</A>,
<A HREF = "man/newstack.html">Newstack</A>
 or <A HREF = "man/blendmont.html">Blendmont</A>,
 and <A HREF = "man/tilt.html">Tilt</A>.
Once you can see both surfaces of the section, estimate how much you would
have to move the section to center it in the image.  Set or change the "amount
to move tilt axis in Z" in align.com.  If the section looks appreciably
tilted, you should also estimate the rotation needed to make it flat.  A
positive slope means that all tilt angles should be changed by a positive
amount.  Make this change in align.com and rerun this file.


<A NAME = "Sampling"><H4>
Sampling 3 Areas of Tomogram and Positioning the Section Optimally
</A></H4>

     The goal of the next step is to shift and rotate your reconstruction so
that it is as flat as possible and will fit into the smallest volume.  This is
done by sampling three regions of the tomogram, ones computed from near the
top, middle, and bottom of the tilt images.  There are two rotations which can
be adjusted: the rotation about the tilt axis, to make the section level when
viewed in the X-Z plane; and a rotation about the X axis, to make the section
come out at the same Z height throughout the length of the tomogram.  The
latter adjustment is optional since it involves more computation time and
requires more interpolations in the back-projection, which could conceivably
reduce resolution.
<P>
     Check your tilt.com file before proceeding.  Eliminate the "slice 1 5 1"
statement if any.  Make the thickness be about 40 pixels bigger than the
estimated thickness of the section.
<P>
     Now run the sample.com file.  When it is finished, you will have 3
sample tomograms, bot.rec, mid.rec, and top.rec (or bota.rec, etc., for
a dual-axis data set).  You have two choices,
automatically finding the section with
 <A HREF = "man/findsection.html">Findsection</A>, or modeling the edges of
the section and computing angles with 
<A HREF = "man/tomopitch.html">Tomopitch</A>.  
<A HREF = "man/findsection.html">Findsection</A> is harder to use
because it can give spurious results that need some judgement to filter out,
so you may prefer to skip it completely and just use 
<A HREF = "man/tomopitch.html">Tomopitch</A>.
<P>
     To use <A HREF = "man/tomopitch.html">Tomopitch</A>,
 first load each of the 3 tomograms into Imod.
Model each edge of the section by drawing a line along
the boundary.  Just use two points, one on the left and one on the right side
of the tomogram.  Put the lines for the top and bottom edges in separate
contours.  In other words, the model should have one object, two contours, two
points per contour.  Save the model on top.rec as top.mod for a single axis
data set, or topa.mod or topb.mod for a dual-axis data set.  Then run
tomopitch.com and examine the result.  For each sample, there is an estimate
of shift, rotation, and thickness, but your main interest is in the estimates
based on all three samples.  These appear at the end of the log file as four
recommendations: the amount of tilt around the X axis, the amount to rotate
the tilt angles, the amount to shift the tilt axis in Z, and the required
thickness for the full tomogram.  If the X-axis tilt is small and your
tomogram is going to be small, don't bother with it, and use the
recommendations before this tilt is taken into account.  Otherwise, use the
final recommendations.  Note that there is one entry in tomopitch.com
specifying the number of pixels to add to the tomogram beyond the surfaces
defined by your lines.  You may want to change this value in some special
cases.
<P>
     To use <A HREF = "man/findsection.html">Findsection</A>,
 run findsec.com and examine the result.  There should
be a thickness and location estimate for 5, 7 or 9 patches across each of the
three sample tomograms.  If a few patches have widely divergent thickness
estimates, edit the findsec.com file to eliminate those patches from the final
calculations and rerun the program. (If there are more than a few such
patches, look at the 3 tomograms to see if there is some other problem.)  The
end of the log file has the same four recommendations just described for
<A HREF = "man/tomopitch.html">Tomopitch</A>.
  (Use the results from the "edge-thicknesses" unless you are
pressed for space or know better).  If you have trouble with 
<A HREF = "man/findsection.html">Findsection</A>, drop
back to using <A HREF = "man/tomopitch.html">Tomopitch</A>.


<A NAME = "Doing Tilted Samples"><H4>
Doing Samples with X-axis Tilt or Local Alignments
</A></H4>

     It is possible to run samples of the tomogram with local alignments or
X-axis tilt taken into account.  You might want do this for your initial
samples if your alignment solution indicates a large X-axis tilt, or you might
want to check the samples on a second round after correcting for X-axis tilt
as above or after introducing local alignments.  In order for 
<A HREF = "man/tilt.html">Tilt</A> to compute
such a portion of a tomogram correctly from a subset of an aligned stack, it
needs to know the starting coordinates of the subset.  Tilt.com has a line
"subsetstart" to enter these coordinates, but you do not need to change this
line if you are running sample.com, because sample.com substitutes the correct
values.  To get samples with these features, modify tilt.com by entering the
desired X-axis tilt, and/or adding a line with the name of your local
alignment file, i.e., add
     localfile setnamelocal.xf
 Run sample.com.  If you do this on your initial run then make models and run
<A HREF = "man/tomopitch.html">Tomopitch</A>,
be sure to ADD the recommended X-axis tilt to the value already
applied tilt.com.

small volume from each tomogram (one of which is rotated) and use 3-D
cross-correlation to find shifts in X, Y and Z.
<LI> <A HREF = "man/matchvol.html">Matchvol</A>:
 Using this initial alignment, generate an initial matching
volume from one of the tomograms.
<LI> <A HREF = "man/patchcrawl3d.html">Patchcrawl3d</A>:
 Extract small patches from a regular 3-D array of
positions in the two volumes (one original, one transformed to match), and
use 3-D cross-correlation to determine the error (displacement) between the
two volumes at each position.
<LI> <A HREF = "man/matchorwarp.html">Matchorwarp</A>:
 Analyze the displacements with 
<A HREF = "man/refinematch.html">Refinematch</A>, and if they
fit well enough to a single linear transformation, use

refining transformation to produce the final matching volume.  If they do
not, run <A HREF = "man/findwarp.html">Findwarp</A>
 to find the best warping between the volumes automatically,
then run <A HREF = "man/warpvol.html">Warpvol</A>
 to produce a final matching volume with a series of linear
transformations.  Warping is done by solving for a series of local 3-D
transformations and making a gradual transition from one to another in the
plane of the section.
<LI> Match the density between the two volumes

because it is much faster to take Fourier transforms of these pieces.

<A NAME = "Setting Up"><H4>
Setting Up
</A></H4>

     Go through the following steps before running Setupcombine:
<OL>
<LI> Decide which tomogram will be transformed to match the other.
Typically, the "b" set is matched to the "a" set.  However, if the two
tomograms are not the same thickness, then the thicker one must be matched to
the thinner one.  If the section is appreciably flatter in one tomogram, then
the other one should be matched to that one.
<LI> Examine the tomogram being matched TO and determine the first and last
slices that contain useful information for cross-correlating the tomograms
(i.e., are inside the section).  Ignore the gold particles; there is
too much empty space around them.
<LI> Try to determine if there are regions within the section that should
not be used for correlating the tomograms because they are either empty of
material or contain reconstruction of poor quality.  You can exclude such
areas from consideration in two ways.  One way is to set more restrictive
lower and upper limits in X and Y on the region from which patches will be
extracted by <A HREF = "man/patchcrawl3d.html">Patchcrawl3d</A>.
  Take note of the coordinates in X and Y beyond
which the image is unreliable, and enter these coordinates to Setupcombine.
The other way is to draw one or more model contours completely enclosing the
patches that you want included in the analysis.  See the man page for
<A HREF = "man/refinematch.html">Refinematch</A>
 for details.  Do not worry about identifying regions in this
tomogram that are outside the bounds of the other tomogram; 
<A HREF = "man/patchcrawl3d.html">Patchcrawl3d</A> will
take care of this limitation.
<LI> If you have fiducials on only one surface, note whether one tomogram
is upside down relative to the other.
<LI> 
If your fiducial points are not in 1:1 correspondence between the two
tomograms, be prepared to specify the correspondences that you are confident
of.  <A HREF = "man/solvematch.html">Solvematch</A>
 can be given a small list of fiducials that are known to
correspond and it will find the remaining correspondences.  There are two
restrictions on this ability: you must give it at least 4 correspondences to
start with (5 is recommended); and if you have fiducials on both surfaces, you
must include at least one from each surface.  To specify correspondences to
Setupcombine, you enter two lists of numbers.  For example, if
you are matching "b" to "a", first enter the list of points from "a" which
have corresponding points in "b", then enter the list of corresponding points
in "b".
<LI>
Decide what size patches to use in Patchcrawl3D.  Ideally, this
decision would be based on how much high frequency information is in the
tomograms and on how well the two volumes seem to agree with each other, but
these features are difficult to assess.  Setupcombine provides three built-in
sizes, small, medium, and large.  Small patches should be adequate for
relatively high-resolution tomograms from film, while the medium patches are
more appropriate for data from a CCD camera.  If the tomograms seem
particularly fuzzy, go up one size in either case.
</OL>

<A NAME = "Temporary Combining Storage"><H4>
Using Temporary Storage for Combining
</A></H4>
     It is possible to use temporary disk space when combining two tomograms;
this is useful if you want to run the combine operation on a machine different
from the one where the two tomograms are located.  Combining creates a large
number of temporary files, and considerable time can be saved by placing these
files on a local disk instead of writing and reading them across a network.
To use this feature, enter the name of a temporary directory (/tmp, /usr/tmp,
or other appropriate scratch directory) when Setupcombine asks if you want to
use one.  Whatever directory you specify must exist already.  Then select
either auto-cleanup or hand-cleanup.  Auto-cleanup will build the final
sum.rec into the current directory and remove all temporary files at the end.
Hand-cleanup is provided if you want the fastest possible access to sum.rec or
if you want to examine the setname.mat file.  With this option, sum.rec is
built in the temporary directory and a link is provided to it from the current
directory.
     When Setupcombine exits, it indicates the name of the directory that it
will be using.  You can look there to monitor the progress of the operation.
(That is where the setname.mat and sumxxx.rec files are built.)  If the
combine operation crashes and has to be restarted, it will use the same
directory.  However, if you have to rerun Setupcombine, the new combine.com
will create a new temporary directory.


<A NAME = "Proceeding"><H4>
Proceeding
</A></H4>

     Run Setupcombine.  There should be nothing to change in combine.com,
unless you have special needs based on prior experience.
<P>
     Make sure that the "....tlt" and "...fid.xyz" files produced by
<A HREF = "man/tiltalign.html">Tiltalign</A> are still present.
<P>
     Check free disk space (df -k). Typically, you need 3 times as much free
space as one tomogram occupies; Setupcombine provides a more accurate
estimate.  You may need to delete the aligned tilt
series (and tape and delete raw tilt series) before proceeding.
<P>
     Run combine.com.  You can monitor the status of the combine operation
by checking the combine.log file.
This file is obnoxiously long, but periodically it contains a line starting
with "STATUS" to report overall progress.  You can pick out these lines by
entering
<BR><CODE>
   grep STATUS combine.log
<BR></CODE>
<P>
When the combining is done (or sooner, if the tomogram is large),
check the combine.log file to see how good the registration between the two
volumes is.  After <A HREF = "man/patchcrawl3d.html">Patchcrawl3d</A>
runs, you
will see <A HREF = "man/refinematch.html">Refinematch</A>'s
 report on the mean and maximum deviation at the various
locations after applying a single linear transformation.  Then there will be
either a message that <A HREF = "man/matchvol.html">Matchvol</A>
 is being run, or a message that warping is
needed.  In the latter case, <A HREF = "man/findwarp.html">Findwarp</A>
 may run several times; just above a
message that <A HREF = "man/warpvol.html">Warpvol</A>
 is being run next will be a report on the mean and
maximum of the mean residuals.  If the mean is reasonable but the maximum is
quite high (1 or more), 
 you should make a patch
vector model with <A HREF = "man/patch2imod.html">Patch2imod</A>
and consider whether to take any of the remedial
actions described below.


<A NAME = "Problems in Combining"><H4>
Problems in Combining
</A></H4>

     If combine.com fails right away, this is probably because of a bad
correspondence between fiducial points.  
<A HREF = "man/solvematch.html">Solvematch</A> can eliminate some bad
points, but if it fails to do this, and there is a maximum residual greater
than 10-20, you should change the entry to Solvematch for corresponding points
so that it specifies only a few points which you are sure correspond.
For a large
volume with serious distortion between the two tomograms, the residuals in the
fit can be high even if there is no error in correspondence; in this case, you
should just increase the "limiting value for maximum residual" entry to 
<A HREF = "man/solvematch.html">Solvematch</A> and proceed.
<P>
     It is possible that <A HREF = "man/matchshifts.html">Matchshifts</A>
 will fail to find the proper shift
between the two tomograms, if the displacement between them is particularly
large.  One sign of this would be large and erratic patch displacements
in the file patch.out, at a variety of coordinates.  (On each line, the first
three numbers are the patch coordinates, and the next three numbers are the
displacements between the two volumes in X, Y, and Z.)  If possible, you
should examine the initial matching volume (setnameb.mat, if matching "b" to
"a") to confirm that <A HREF = "man/matchshifts.html">Matchshifts</A>
 has failed.  To correct for this, you have to
make models of corresponding points by loading both tomograms into Imod with
-Y.  Make two models, "setnamea.matmod" and "setnameb.matmod", containing 3-5
corresponding points, as described in the man page for
 <A HREF = "man/solvematch.html">Solvematch</A>.  If you are
marking gold particles, put the model point on the section with the strongest
white side bands around the black bead.  Uncomment the "goto usemodels"
entry in combine.com and rerun it.
<P>
     If combine.com exits because neither 
<A HREF = "man/refinematch.html">Refinematch</A>
 nor <A HREF = "man/findwarp.html">Findwarp</A> could find
a fit to the patch displacements with a sufficiently low mean residual, then
there are several possible reasons.  The patches could be too
small, leading to widespread random errors.  There could be local regions in 
the volume where a relatively high proportion of patches have large errors, a
situation that the outlier elimination algorithm in 
<A HREF = "man/findwarp.html">Findwarp</A> cannot handle.
Finally, there could be inaccurate displacements only along one or more edges
of the volume.  To assess this situation, the first step is to make and
examine a model that will show the patch displacements as vectors, with
<CODE><BR>     patch2imod patch.out patchvector.mod   </CODE><BR>
 This program will convert each displacement to a line whose length is 10
times the actual length of the displacement.  To allow editing of this model,
display the model without images in the Zap window using
<CODE><BR>     imod patchvector.mod   </CODE><BR>
 then open the model view window with "v".  Spin the model slowly and zoom as
needed to see the pattern of displacement vectors.  
<P>
     1) If there are many lines that do not fit the pattern of surrounding
lines, scattered around the whole volume, then you should rerun 
<A HREF = "man/patchcrawl3d.html">Patchcrawl3d</A>
with larger patches.  Modify the first three entries on the 
<A HREF = "man/patchcrawl3d.html">Patchcrawl3d</A>
command line in combine.com.  A 25% increase in each dimension is recommended,
as this will double the volume of the patches and substantially improve
accuracy.  Uncomment the "goto dopatch" entry at the top of combine.com and
rerun the command file.
<P>
     2) If displacements generally look fairly regular but there are a large 
number of bad patches in well-defined regions, it may be easiest to make a
model with contours enclosing the regions with good patches, or to modify
such a model if you have already made one.  Do do this while looking at the
patch vector model, you would have to load the tomogram being matched to into
a separate Imod and make or edit the boundary contour model there, while
trying to correlate positions between the tomogram and the patch vector model.
If you do make a new model of boundary contours, add the entries "-modelfile"
and the model filename right after the "matchorwarp" line in combine.com.
With either a new or a modified model, uncomment the "goto domatchorwarp" 
entry at the top of combine.com and rerun the command file.
<P>
     3) If bad patches are fairly scattered and not too numerous, it is most
appropriate to edit them out.  To do this, position the mouse on an aberrant
vector in the model
view window and press the third mouse button to select
this contour in the Zap window.  If you have any doubt about which contour you
selected, use the [ and ] hotkeys in the Zap window to examine the
starting and ending points of the contour.  The starting point will be at a
regular position in array, while the ending point should be
displaced by an unusual amount.
Delete the contour with the "D" hotkey in the Zap window;
it will disappear from the model view
window also.  When finished, save the model and exit.  Then run 
<A HREF = "man/imod2patch.html">Imod2patch</A>:
<CODE><BR>     imod2patch patchvector.mod patch.out    </CODE><BR>
 You may want to rename the existing patch.out before doing this.  Uncomment
the "goto domatchorwarp" entry at the top of combine.com and rerun the command
file.
<P>
     4) If the patch vector model indicates that bad patches are numerous near
edges of the volume, or if all else fails, you will need to run 
<A HREF = "man/findwarp.html">Findwarp</A>
interactively.  See the man page for 
<A HREF = "man/findwarp.html">Findwarp</A>.  First explore whether omitting
a whole column or row of patches will dramatically improve the fit to all of
the remaining patches.  If this fit is adequate (e.g., residual < 0.3), then
you can exit, saving a single refining transformation in a file named
refine.xf.  In this case, uncomment the "goto domatch" entry at the top of
combine.com and rerun the command file.  Otherwise, examine results with
transformations based on various subsets of patches, but no fewer than 3 by 3
by 2 or 4 by 2 by 2.  Try to retain all of the rows and columns if possible.
Use the largest subset of patches that will give a mean residual error under
about 0.2 pixels.  Save the transformations in a file named warp.xf.
Uncomment the "goto dowarp" entry at the top of combine.com and rerun the
command file.


<A NAME = "SCALING AND TRIMMING"><H3>
SCALING AND TRIMMING A TOMOGRAM
</A></H3>

     <A HREF = "man/trimvol.html">Trimvol</A> is a single tool for trimming a volume and converting it to
bytes.  It can run Findcontrast to find optimal contrast settings for
converting it to bytes, and runs Newstack to make the final byte file. If you
simply convert a tomogram to bytes without a contrast setting, then the
contrast range for features of interest can be quite compressed and it can be
difficult to adjust contrast for viewing in Imod.  You can avoid this problem
by saturating the intensities of gold particles (and other irrelevant features
like stain precipitate) when converting to bytes.  These instructions assume
that your final tomogram is from a dual-axis series and is named "sum.rec".
<P>
     First, load sum.rec into Imod with -Y and determine the starting and
ending slices of a range that excludes features whose intensity can be
saturated.  Findcontrast will ignore areas within 10% of the edges of these
slices.  If you want to trim the volume, note the first and last section that
you want to keep, as well as limiting coordinates near the left, right,
bottom, and top edges if you want to trim the lateral size of the volume.  All
of these number can be Imod coordinates, numbered from 1.  For no trimming,
just enter
<BR><CODE>   trimvol -s start,end sum.rec setname.rec <BR></CODE>
 where start and end are the starting and ending slices for finding contrast.
In the most general case, enter
<BR><CODE>
   trimvol -s start,end -x left,rt -y first,last -z bot,top sum.rec setname.rec
<BR></CODE>
 where first and last are the first and last sections, while left, rt, bot,
and top are the limiting coordinates on the left, right, bottom, and top of a
section in the flipped tomogram.
<P>
     If the automatic contrast limits are unsatisfactory, you can determine
contrast settings in Imod by moving both contrast (Black and White) sliders to
the same position.  While movieing through the data, adjust the positions of
both sliders together until only the gold beads (and other irrelevant
features) show up as black pixels; this slider value is the lower contrast
limit.  Then adjust both sliders so that only the overshoots around the beads
show up as white pixels; this slider value is the upper contrast limit.  Enter
<BR><CODE>
   trimvol -c black,white sum.rec setname.rec
<BR></CODE>

<P>
     If your images were acquired on a CCD camera with limited spatial
resolution, you may be able to reduce the size of the final volume
considerably with no perceptible loss of image detail.  The shell script
<A HREF = "man/squeezevol.html">Squeezevol</A>
provides an easy interface for scaling a volume down by
interpolation using 
<A HREF = "man/matchvol.html">Matchvol</A>.  Since resolution is worse in the direction
perpendicular to the plane of the section (the Y direction in a flipped
tomogram), it could be appropriate to squeeze the volume more in that
dimension.  For example, if the CCD camera provides no useful information
above 0.8 of Nyquist, an overall reduction by 1.25 would be appropriate, 
and a reduction 1.3 times higher in the Y dimension would also be appropriate
given the extra point-spread in that dimension in a tomographic
reconstruction.  The size of the volume can be reduced by a factor of 2.5 
with:
<BR><CODE>
   squeezevol -f 1.25 -y 1.62 setname.rec setname.sqz
<BR></CODE>



<A NAME = "CLEANING UP"><H3>
CLEANING UP
</A></H3>


     Cleaning up your files is very important!  If you do want a copy of one
of the tilt series, reduce it to bytes and float the intensities with:
<BR><CODE>
     newst -mo 0 -fl 2 setname.ali name_of_tilt_series_file
<BR></CODE>
 after this, you can remove *.ali files. 
<P>
    Once you are satisfied that your final tomogram is truly final, you can
remove the following big files:
<PRE>
  sum*.rec
  setnamea.rec
  setnameb.rec
  setname*.mat
</PRE>
     If you ever have to rebuild the tomogram, it is helpful to keep all of
the files except .log files.  For future reference, you may want to keep the
align.log files, possibly the findsec.log files, and combine.log.  All
of these files can be put on tape or CD with the raw image stacks, or on an
optical disk.
<P>
   Finally, archive and delete the raw image stacks.  The shell script
<A HREF = "man/splitmrc.html">Splitmrc</A>
can be used to divide a very 
large MRC file into pieces that will fit
on multiple CDs; <A HREF = "man/recombine.html">Recombine</A>
can be used later to put the pieces back together.
