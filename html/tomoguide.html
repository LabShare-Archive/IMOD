<A NAME = "BACKGROUND"><H3>
1. BACKGROUND
</H3></A>
This is a guide to building single and dual axis tomograms with IMOD using
the eTomo interface.  It contains sufficient detail to serve as a reference
guide, which makes it less suitable when starting out.  The recommended
approach is to work through our <A HREF = "etomoTutorial.html">tutorial</A>
with a sample data set before trying
to use this guide to process your own data.  If for some reason you
are unable to use Etomo with your data, you will need to use the 
<A HREF = "preEtomoGuide.html">older version</A> of this guide.

<P>
<A NAME = "Program Names"><H4>
1.1. Program Names
</H4></A>
In this document, program names are capitalized.  However, their true
names are all lower case, and they must be run by entering these names in
lower case because UNIX is case-sensitive.

<P>
<A NAME = "Command Files"><H4>
1.2. Command Files
</H4></A>
eTomo works with the same set of command files that used to be edited and
run on the command line in earlier versions of IMOD.  These files have
the extension <CODE>.com</CODE>, and when a command file is run,
program output is
recorded in a log file with the extension <CODE>.log</CODE>.  When you
open the panel for a particular step, eTomo
reads the existing contents of a command file to set the parameters
and settings that appear in the panel.
When you run an operation,
it writes the current parameters into the command file.  eTomo also
makes sure that the command file matches your entries when you leave a
panel by pressing <B>Done</B> or <B>Postpone</B> or simply by selecting
another panel with a button on the left.
<P>
You can run a command file at the command line with the "subm" alias,
which is defined in the IMOD startup files.
For example, if you enter "subm track", a file named
track.com will be executed in the background, a log file will be created
called track.log, and a message will appear when the command file is completed.
For more information on the format of command files and how to run
them, see <A HREF = "tomoExtra.html#Command Files">Command Files</A> in
the Extra Topics section.  If you want to make or edit command files, or if
you want to run programs at the command line, see also the section on 
<A HREF = "tomoExtra.html#Entries to Programs">Entries to Programs</A>.

<P>
<A NAME = "Numbering System"><H4>
1.3. Numbering System
</H4></A>
Sections or views in the image files are consistently numbered from 1
within
the graphical interface programs,
eTomo,
3dmod, and Midas.
However, many other programs in the IMOD package number coordinates
from 0, which was the original convention for MRC files.
If you work exclusively within eTomo, you need not be concerned
about this; but if you run other programs in the package you need to
be aware of this problem.
When a program refers to "view numbers", these are always numbered from
1; but when a program refers to "section numbers" or "Z values", there
is a good chance that they are numbered from 0.  The most important
example is the program <A HREF = "man/newstack.html">Newstack</A>, which is
often used for rearranging or extracting sections from a stack.

<P>
<A NAME = "Backup Files"><H4>
1.4. Backup Files
</H4></A>
     Nearly every program that you run will create a backup file if an output
file already exists, rather than simply deleting the old version of the output
file.  The existing file is renamed by adding a "~" at the end.
This can lead to some large
unneeded files if commands are run more than once.  It is helpful to have an
alias for purging backup files in your .cshrc: <BR><CODE> alias purge '\rm *~'
<BR></CODE>
 With this alias, "purge" will delete all backup files without asking for 
confirmation.

<P>
<A NAME = "Using Insecure Storage"><H4>
1.5. Using Temporary or Insecure Storage
</H4></A>
     It is possible to have your small working files automatically saved to
another directory every time that you run a command file.  This will provide
backup protection if you build tomograms in a disk area that is not regularly
backed up.  To use this feature, first be sure that the directory where you
will do your work and the directory where files should be saved both exist.
If you choose to copy your raw stacks to the working directory, which
you might want to do 
if this gives significantly
faster access, then you can proceed as described below.  If you want
to leave the raw stacks in the backed up location, then eTomo can
create links to them for you, but this will work best if you
start eTomo from the directory where you will build the tomogram.
<P>
     After every command file is run, the script "savework" will be run
automatically, copying files over to the source directory.  You can also run
"savework" yourself at any time (for example, after working on a fiducial
model for a while).

<P>
<A NAME = "NON-BOULDER NOTES"><H3>
2. NOTES FOR NON-BOULDER USERS
</H3></A>

<P>
<A NAME = "File Naming Conventions"><H4>
2.1. File Naming Conventions
</H4></A>
In order for the processing sequence to work, the names of your starting files
must follow several conventions.
The raw image stacks must have the extension ".st"; so for a single axis
tilt series the name should be dataSetName.st.  For a dual axis data set,
the two files must end in "a.st" and "b.st", i.e. dataSetNamea.st and
dataSetNameb.st.  The data set name can contain ".", "-", and "_" as
separators but must not contain spaces or other characters that could
confuse a Unix shell.
<P>
If you are supplying your own file of raw tilt angles, they must be named with
the data set name followed by ".rawtlt" (or "a.rawtlt" and "b.rawtlt" for a
dual axis tilt series.

<P>
<A NAME = "Film versus CCD Images"><H4>
2.2. Film versus CCD Images
</H4></A>
     Some of the programs make a distinction between images from film and ones
acquired on a CCD camera.  This is based on an obsolete method of
digitizing from film, in which tilt images were already in good translational
and rotational alignment after being digitized.  eTomo does not
currently handle the command files tailored to
data from film.  
If your data 
are already in very good alignment, the only disadvantage to
processing it in eTomo is that you will have to run the prealignment
step.  This is worth it to avoid editing and running command files by hand.

<P>
<A NAME = "Image Scaling"><H4>
2.3. Image Scaling and Contrast Polarity
</H4></A>
     The default parameters for reconstruction assume that the numbers in your
images are linearly related to the number of transmitted electrons caught
by the detector.  This is the case if images are recorded directly by CCD
camera or if film is digitized in optical density units.  The logarithm of
such values should then be proportional to projected mass density for imaging
dominated by amplitude (aperture) contrast.  Because of this, the
backprojection program, <A HREF = "man/tilt.html">Tilt</A>,
has an option to take the log
of the numbers after adding a base value (which might correspond to the
fog level of film).  The default is to take logs with a zero base
value.
If your images are already mass-normalized, you should
remove the zero entry in the <B>Log offset</B> box in the <B>Tomogram
Generation Panel</B>; if your images are in arbitrarily scaled
units, you may need to remove that entry or at least adjust the offset value
that is added so that all values will be positive before taking the log.
If you remove the log entry, you also need to change the <B>Output density
scaling factor</B> to 1; the default value is a large number that is needed to
scale the logs up again after backprojection.
<P>
If your data were derived from unsigned 16-bit integers and have had 32768
subtracted from them for storage as signed integers in the MRC file, the
programs will try to detect this and set the base to 32768.
<P>
     If electron density appears as white in your images, 
<A HREF = "man/beadtrack.html">Beadtrack</A> will
fail to track your fiducials properly with the default settings.
Simply change the 0 to a 1 in the <B>Fiducial marker size & polarity</B>
box in the <B>Fiducial Model Generation Panel</B>.

<P>
<A NAME = "Image File Header"><H4>
2.4. Image File Header
</H4></A>
As of IMOD 2.6.19, the 
programs described here will work when the header of the raw MRC stack 
indicates a "Pixel spacing" other than 1.0 or "Origin" values other than 0.0.
Earlier versions required the 
pixel spacing to be 1,1,1 and the
origin to be at 0,0,0.
Check the header with:
<BR><CODE>     header filename
<BR></CODE>
 If you need to change the pixel spacing or origin to conform to the old
requirements, run:
<BR><CODE>     alterheader filename
<BR></CODE>
 enter "fixpixel" to fix the pixel size at 1,1,1, enter "org" and 0,0,0 to fix
the origin, and enter "done" to rewrite the header and exit.


<P>
<A NAME = "INITIAL STEPS"><H3>
3. SETUP
</H3></A>
To work on a new data set, start eTomo and fill in the entries in the
<B>Setup Panel</B> that appears.
You need not start eTomo from the directory where the files are located.


<UL>
<LI>Dataset Name: eTomo can work with either the full name of one of
the data files or the name of the data set, excluding "a", "b", and
".st".  The easiest way to specify the name is to push the browse
button and select one of the data stacks.

<LI>Backup Directory: This field can remain blank, but see the section above 
on 
<A HREF = "#Using Insecure Storage">Using Temporary or Insecure
Storage</A>
for an explanation of this option.

<LI> Data Type: Currently, the only relevant option to select in this box is 
whether the data are single or dual axis.

<LI> Scan Header: Push this button to attempt to retrieve the pixel
size and image rotation from the image file header.  This will work
with data from SerialEM on the Tecnai as well as with files using David
Agard's extended header format, which is also used in the FEI
tomography acquisition software.

<LI> Pixel size and Fiducial diameter: These values are used only by
<A HREF = "man/beadtrack.html">Beadtrack</A>.  If you do not know the
pixel size, you can enter 1, and the measured diameter of the gold
particles in pixels.

<LI> Initial rotation:
This is
the angle from vertical to the tilt axis in the raw images (e.g., if the axis
runs from top left to bottom right, the angle would be 45 degrees).
If the tilt axis is already vertical,
enter a 0.  If the tilt axis is horizontal, enter 90 to have the aligned
images be rotated clockwise from their current orientation, or -90 to have
them rotated counterclockwise.  This will determine the orientation of the
resulting tomogram.

<LI> Image distortion field file: Use this to select a distortion field 
file for correction of imaging distortion, if appropriate.  If the environment
variable IMOD_CALIB_DIR is defined, eTomo will open the file chooser at
$IMOD_CALIB_DIR/Distortion.  Once a distortion field has been defined, it will
be used when generating the coarse aligned and final aligned stacks.

<LI> Binning: This entry is relevant only if using distortion field
corrections and is needed to specify the binning at which
images were acquired on the CCD camera.

<LI> Tilt angles: eTomo provides three choices for getting the initial
tilt angles that are needed by <A HREF = "man/beadtrack.html">Beadtrack</A>,
<A HREF = "man/tiltalign.html">Tiltalign</A>, and
<A HREF = "man/tiltxcorr.html">Tiltxcorr</A>.  First, the angles can be
extracted from the extended header in the image file.  This will
work with files produced by SerialEM, as well as with files using the
Agard extended header format.
Second, you can specify the starting and increment tilt angles.
Third, you can supply a file with the tilt angles, one per line.
A file
with raw tilt values should be named "setname.rawtlt".  If you have 
regular angles with some variations, you may find a 
nearly correct file in $IMOD_DIR/com.

<LI>Exclude views: If you know in advance that you want to exclude
some views from the reconstruction, you can enter the list of views in
this text box.  However, this is not essential; you will have a chance
to enter or add to such a list at later stages in the process.
</UL>

Once you have made all of these entries, push the button to <B>Create
Com Scripts</B>.  eTomo will run the Copytomocoms script to produce
command files for processing the
data, as follows:

<UL>
<LI><B>Preprocessing</B>: uses eraser.com to run
<A HREF = "man/ccderaser.html">Ccderaser</A> to erase X-rays from images
<LI><B>Coarse Alignment</B>: uses xcorr.com to run
<A HREF = "man/tiltxcorr.html">Tiltxcorr</A> to get an initial
alignment by correlation
<BR>
  uses prenewst.com to run <A HREF = "man/xftoxg.html">Xftoxg</A> and 
<A HREF = "man/newstack.html">Newstack</A> to get a temporary pre-aligned stack
<LI><B>Fiducial Model Generation</B>: uses track.com to run
<A HREF = "man/beadtrack.html">Beadtrack</A> to generate a fiducial model
<LI><B>Fine Alignment</B>: uses align.com to run
<A HREF = "man/tiltalign.html">Tiltalign</A> to get the alignment
<LI><B>Tomogram Positioning</B>: uses sample.com to run
<A HREF = "man/newstack.html">Newstack</A> and the
<A HREF = "man/tilt.html">Tilt</A> command file on three regions 
<BR>
 uses tomopitch.com to run <A HREF = "man/tomopitch.html">Tomopitch</A>
to find the pitch of the section from a model on the three regions
<LI><B>Tomogram Generation</B>: uses newst.com to run 
<A HREF = "man/newstack.html">Newstack</A> to make an aligned stack
<BR>
 optionally uses mtffilter.com to run <A HREF =
"man/mtffilter.html">Mtffilter</A> to filter the aligned stack.
<BR>
 uses tilt.com to run <A HREF = "man/tilt.html">Tilt</A> to generate a tomogram
</UL>

<P>
Each ".com" file generates a corresponding ".log" file when it is
run.  In eTomo, you can examine a log file by clicking the
right mouse button over free space within a panel; the menu that pops up will
show the relevant log files for that panel.
<P>
     If you have a two-axis tilt series, you will get one copy for each
series, with names "...a.com" and "...b.com".
For convenience, most command files will be referred to
below by a name without an "a" or "b" (e.g., track.com), but in practice you
will always be running an "a" or "b" version when you have a dual tilt series.
<P>
     The man pages for the programs run by these command files give full
details on their operation and on the meaning of the entries to each.  Consult
them for any questions on the options available in these programs.
<P>
If you find that you need to run Copytomocoms by hand, see
<A HREF = "tomoExtra.html#Getting Files">Getting Command Files</A> in
the Extra Topics section for more details.


<P>
<A NAME = "PRE-PROCESSING"><H3>
4. PRE-PROCESSING: REMOVING X-RAYS
</H3></A>
<P>
X-rays and other flaws in CCD camera images can produce extreme low or
high values that ruin the contrast when you view the images in <A HREF = "man/3dmod.html">3dmod</A>,
and can also give undesirable artifacts in the reconstruction.  These
defects can be wiped out with <A HREF = "man/ccderaser.html">Ccderaser</A>,
which finds X-rays in two ways.  It looks for "peaks", or pixels whose
intensity deviate from the surrounding pixels
by a certain number of standard deviations, which is
specified in the <B>Peak criterion</B> text box.  It also looks for
pixel-to-pixel differences that exceed background by a certain number
of SDs, specified in the <B>Difference criterion</B> text box.
<P>
When <A HREF = "man/ccderaser.html">Ccderaser</A> runs, it produces an 
IMOD model marking the pixels that
were found.  Press the <B>View X-ray Model</B> button to see this
model.  Points are sorted into different objects based on how much they
exceeded a criterion (less than 1 SD for object 1, 1-2 SDs for object
2, etc.).  You will probably be surprised at how many points are
marked, possibly on the order of 100 points per image for a 2K by 2K
camera.  In our experience, the default criteria are conservative for
unbinned images and
all of these points are indeed X-rays.  However, in binned images, the
difference criterion may pick up some pixels on the edge of gold
particles used as fiducials.  If you see this happen, you can prevent it by
raising the difference criterion to 10 or more.
<P> 
If you want see the effects of changing criteria, you can save time by
running in trial mode, using the <B>Find X-rays</B> button.  The
program will analyze images and produce a model without writing an
output image stack.
<P>
When you press the <B>Create Fixed Stack</B> button, 
<A HREF = "man/ccderaser.html">Ccderaser</A> writes the corrected
images into a file named "setname_fixed.st".  If you are satisfied
with the result, press the <B>Use Fixed Stack</B> button to rename
the original file to "setname_orig.st" and replace it with the fixed stack.
<P>
If you find that some X-rays are too large to be removed with the default
parameters, increase the <B>Maximum radius</B> to encompass these large
X-rays and try again.
<P>
If your images have other features that do not get corrected by the
automatic X-ray removal, you can specify the pixels to erase in a
model file.  Press the <B>Advanced</B> button to reveal the controls
for this option, and see the man page for 
<A HREF = "man/ccderaser.html">Ccderaser</A> for
details on how to construct the model file.

<P>
<A NAME = "COARSE ALIGNMENT"><H3>
5. COARSE ALIGNMENT BY CROSS-CORRELATION
</H3></A>
The main purpose of this step is to get the images aligned well enough for
the automatic tracking of fiducials to work.  There are generally no
parameters to adjust, so you proceed by pushing the top three buttons
in sequence.  
<UL>
<LI><B>Calculate cross-correlation</B> uses <A HREF =
"man/tiltxcorr.html">Tiltxcorr</A> to determine the X and Y
translations needed to align each image with the previous one.
<LI><B>Generate coarse aligned stack</B> converts these translations
from one view to the next into translations that will bring all of the
images into alignment.  It then applies the latter translations to
produce the aligned stack.
<LI><B>View aligned stack in 3dmod</B> to check whether images are
adequately aligned.  If you see sudden jumps in feature positions, you
need to adjust the alignment by hand.  If there are only gradual
shifts in alignment, such as a drift in apparent tilt axis location at
high tilt, you do not need to adjust for this.
</UL>
<P>
Press <B>Fix Alignment with Midas</B> only if you need to adjust some
of the alignments.  This will start <A HREF =
"man/midas.html">Midas</A> on the raw image stack, with the alignment
transformations determined on the first step.  Go to the pairs of
views that showed problems, and use the left mouse button to translate
each pair of images into alignment.  When you toggle between a pair of
images, you should see the section appear to tilt around an axis in
the middle.  The tilt axis should appear to be vertical because 
<A HREF = "man/midas.html">Midas</A> applies a global rotation to the images,
starting with the value in the <B>Tilt axis rotation</B> text box on 
the <B>Coarse Alignment</B> panel.
If you have a big magnification change, you could also
correct for this using the right mouse button while holding the Shift
key down.
<P>
After fixing and saving transformations, you must generate a new coarse 
aligned stack.
<P>
The coarse aligned stack will be used for tracking the fiducial model, and
there might be cases where you want to work with binned images for this
procedure.  You can set a binning for this stack by pressing the
<B>Advanced</B> button then adjusting the entry for 
<B>Coarse aligned image stack binning</B> before generating the stack.
If you change your mind after starting to work on a fiducial model, you can go
back to this panel, change the binning, and generate a new prealigned stack.
The existing model will load correctly onto the stack with the new binning;
just be sure to save the model after doing this and eventually run the fine
alignment, which will synchronize
all information about the pixel size.
<P>
<A Name = "Fiducialless Quick"><H4>
5.1 Making a Quick Tomogram with Correlation Alignment
</A></H4>
It is possible to generate a tomogram using only the coarse alignment from
cross-correlation.  This could be used to get a tomogram quickly to see
whether it is worth doing the fiducial alignment, or if the tilt series was
just for scanning purposes, or if there are no fiducials.  This section
describes a
simple procedure for getting a tomogram quickly; for more detail on how to get
as good a tomogram as possible from this procedure, see
<A HREF = "tomoExtra.html#Fiducialless Tomogram">Making a Tomogram with 
Correlation Alignment</A> in the Extra Topics section.
<OL>
<LI>Press <B>Calculate cross-correlation</B>.
<LI>Check <B>Fiducialless alignment</B>
<LI>Press <B>Done</B>.  There is no need to make a coarse aligned stack in
this panel because its tilt axis is not vertical.
<LI>Press <B>Done</B> on the <B>Tomogram Positioning</B> panel to get to the
<B>Tomogram Generation</B> panel.
<LI>Adjust the <B>Tilt axis rotation</B> if it does not match the values that
you usually get for rotation angle in a fiducial alignment solution at this
magnification.
<LI>Select an appropriate binning, then press <B>Generate Full Aligned
Stack</B>.  The speed of tomogram computation is roughly proportional to the 
cube of the binning.
<LI>Press <B>View Full Aligned Stack</B> and check the alignment.  If
something needs to be fixed, press <B>Coarse
Alignment</B>, then <B>Fix Alignment with Midas</B>.  After fixing the
alignment, come back to the <B>Tomogram Generation</B> panel.
<LI>Set an appropriate <B>Tomogram thickness in Z</B>.  Thickness is specified
in unbinned pixels so that its value is independent of the selected binning.
<LI>Press <B>Generate Tomogram</B>.
</OL>
<P>
If you need to set the position of a tomogram built with fiducialless
alignment, see the <A HREF = "tomoExtra.html#Fiducialless Tomogram">Extra
Topics</A> section.  It is recommended that you NOT do this if you plan to go
back and do the fiducial alignment procedure.
<P>
<A NAME = "GETTING FIDUCIAL"><H3>
6. FIDUCIAL MODEL GENERATION
</A></H3>
     The first step is to set up a seed model.  Press
<B>Seed Fiducial Model Using 3dmod</B> to open the prealigned stack and
an empty model in <A HREF = "man/3dmod.html">3dmod</A>.
Pick a view near zero tilt that has good images of the
beads.  Put one point exactly in the center of each desired bead (zoom up to 3
or 4 to do this accurately).  Each bead should be in a separate contour;
<A HREF = "man/beadtrack.html">Beadtrack</A>
 will try to extend each contour through the tilt series.  Beads too
close to the edges are not trackable by 
<A HREF = "man/beadtrack.html">Beadtrack</A> but could be tracked by hand
if necessary.  Try to have at least 8 beads well distributed over the area.
The more beads you have, the better the alignment will be, up to a point, but
the more work it may take for you to complete the model.
If the beads are all on one surface, there is
not much point in having more than 12 or so; if they are on both surfaces, 20
or more may be useful.  However, for areas larger than 1000x1000 pixels,
you will probably need to use local alignments, in which case you should have 
at least 
8-12 fiducials per 1000 by 1000 pixel area 
acquired with a CCD camera, or
6-8 fiducials per 500 by 500 pixel area digitized from film.  (See

Sometimes you will want to have <A HREF =

start with an existing
fiducial model instead of a seed model.  This is especially helpful when there
are a large number of beads that failed to track.  For example, you might
extend some fiducials past a view where they failed to track then try to get
<A HREF = "man/beadtrack.html">Beadtrack</A> to track them the rest
of the way,
or you might want to add fiducials when you realize that you
need to use local alignments.  To use the existing fiducial model as a seed for
another run, go to Advanced mode and press <B>Use Fiducial Model as Seed</B>.
Your original seed model will be renamed to 
setname_orig.seed the first time that you do this.
Then just press <B>Track Fiducial Seed Model</B> again.  You can
repeat
this sequence as many times as needed.
This procedure will tend to fill in gaps in the model, which is usually
appropriate.
However, if you have already left some gaps in the model

<A NAME = "Transferring Fiducial"><H4>
6.2. Getting Fiducials for a Second Axis
</A></H4>
If you are doing a double-tilt series, at least some (8-10) of the beads
that you track must be the same in the two series.  The shell script 
<A HREF = "man/transferfid.html">Transferfid</A> will help ensure this
by making a seed model for the second axis based on the fiducial model
for the first axis.  To use this tool, complete your fiducial model
for the
first axis.  
Since 
<A HREF = "man/transferfid.html">Transferfid</A> uses information from
Tiltalign 
to make the most reliable estimate of how fiducials 
correspond between the two series, you also need to run Tiltalign at
least once.  If you want, you can do this even before fixing
the first fiducial model; just press <B>Compute Alignment</B> on the
<B>Fine Alignment</B> panel for the first axis.  This process also requires a
coarse aligned stack for the second axis, so proceed through the coarse
alignment steps for the second axis until you reach the 
<B>Fiducial Model Generation</B> panel.
If your
tilt angles are not in ".rawtlt" files, you also must fill in the view
numbers of the zero-tilt views in the <B>Center view</B> text boxes
(visible in Advanced mode).
Press <B>Transfer Fiducials from Other Axis</B> to begin the operation.
<A HREF = "man/transferfid.html">Transferfid</A>
will search for the pair of views in the two series
that correspond the best, then transfer the fiducials from the first
series to make the seed model for the second series.  At the end, the
program indicates the number of fiducials that failed to transfer and how
corresponding fiducials should be specified when
setting up to combine the tomograms; this information is saved in a 
transferfid.log file.  The output file that 
<A HREF = "man/transferfid.html">Transferfid</A> creates is the seed model
for the second axis.
<P>
If <A HREF = "man/transferfid.html">Transferfid</A> fails to work
on the first attempt (as indicated by an unusually large number of fiducials
that failed to transfer or a seed model that contains incorrect model
points), you may need to set the translational and
rotational alignment between the two series manually with 
<A HREF = "man/midas.html">Midas</A>.  To do this, just check 
<B>Run midas</B> and run the transfer again.  
<A HREF = "man/midas.html">Midas</A> will start up with the center
views from the two tilt series.  Adjust the alignment with translation
and
rotation (left and middle mouse buttons).  Do not be alarmed if you
have to rotate the image by 180 degrees.  Save the transformation and
exit.  The search for the best corresponding pair of views will
proceed using this starting alignment.
<P>
The Advanced mode allows you to specify the views to search around 
and to limit or expand the number of views in the search.  As a last
resort, you could set the <B>Number of views in the search</B> to 1
and set the alignment as well as possible in <A HREF =
"man/midas.html">Midas</A>, including a magnification change and stretch.
<P>
If the transfer operation still fails, you
can run <A HREF = "man/3dmod.html">3dmod</A>
on both stacks at once and add some initial points to the second seed
model in the same order that they occur in the first fiducial model.  It
is helpful to open one of the images in the Slicer window and rotate
it by 90 degrees with the Z slider.  You
only need to make the first 5 beads correspond, or however many are
needed to sample beads on both surfaces, if beads are on two surfaces.
After that, you can add the rest in any order.
If
you do this, then when you prepare to combine the two tomograms, you would
specify that only the first 5 beads correspond.

<P>
<A NAME = "FINAL ALIGNMENT"><H3>
7. FINE ALIGNMENT
</H3></A>
The goal of the final alignment is to transform the images so that they
represent projections of a solid body tilted around the Y axis, as well as to
refine the projection angles.  In order to transform the images, one needs to
determine the rotation, translation, and scaling (magnification) to be applied
to each image.  It is also possible to solve for variables which will correct
for linear distortions of the specimen.
<P>
<A NAME = "Running Tiltalign"><H4>
7.1. Running Tiltalign
</A></H4>
     Whether you have fiducials on one surface or two determines what
variables can be solved for.  If there are beads on only one surface, you can
solve for either tilt angles or stretch in the X direction but not both.  If
there are beads distributed through the
depth of the sample (typically but not necessarily on two surfaces), 
you can solve both for tilt angles and for
distortion, or for tilt angles and compression, but not for all three kinds of
variables.
<P>
     It is recommended that you first run
<A HREF = "man/tiltalign.html">Tiltalign</A>
with all tilt angles independently variable and no
distortion; this will reveal bad fiducials, and
reveal some sudden changes in alignment that may need to be taken into account
when grouping views together.  The parameters that initially appear
in the <B>Global Variables</B> page of the 
<B>Fine Alignment</B> panel provide for this kind of alignment.  
At a later stage, typically after fixing
fiducials, you would group the tilt angles as appropriate and possibly include 
distortion.
<P>
Before computing an alignment for the first time, check the following

after the alignment solution is obtained.
</OL>
<P>
Press <B>Compute Alignment</B> and examine the results in the log file after
the process is done.  The lengthy log file has been split into useful
sections under different tabs.  The first page that you see, <B>Errors</B>,
shows two useful summary values.  One is the ratio of measured values to
unknowns, which provides an indication of how robust the solution is against
random errors and of whether there might be too many independent variables
being solved for.  The other is the residual error mean, a global measure of
the quality of the fit.  A residual error is the distance in pixels between the
measured position of a fiducial on a view and the position predicted by the
alignment solution.  You can view a model of the residuals at every point,
exaggerated by a factor of 10, by pressing the <B>View Residual Vectors</B>
button (see <A HREF = "#Residual Model Output">Residual Model Output</A>.
This feature is particularly useful for assessing whether you need
to use local alignments.
<P>
The <B>Solution</B> page shows the value of some of the alignment variables
for each view.
Examine the tilt angles, looking for places where
they change by unusual amounts.  The column labeled "deltilt" shows the
difference between the solved
tilt angle and the original, nominal tilt angle.  This column should change
gradually (except at pictures taken out of sequence), varying from one view
to the next by only 0.1 to 0.2
degrees.  Low tilt angles cannot be solved for as accurately, so variability
might be somewhat greater there, sometimes by a lot.  For this reason, you
should always turn on grouping of tilt angles for your final alignment,
regardless of whether you solve for distortion as well.  The
"mag" column shows the effect of overall shrinkage and slight magnification
changes due to changes in focus.  If either the "mag" or the "deltilt"
column shows a sudden
change that is much larger than surrounding changes, consider making
all of the views after this change be a separate view group,
as described above.  When
you start grouping views in later steps, this
will keep views on the two sides of the transition from being constrained
to having the same values of some variables.
<P>
The last column on the <B>Solution</B> page, "mean resid", shows the mean
error (residual) in pixels
for all
of the points on each particular view.  This information will reveal whether
some views give a poorer fit than others.
<P>
The <B>Surface Angles</B> page shows the results of an analysis of the
solved bead positions in 3D and recommends a 
change in tilt angles that would make the beads lie in a
horizontal plane. 
Make the recommended
change at least after the first run of 
<A HREF = "man/tiltalign.html">Tiltalign</A> by taking the value
shown for "Total tilt angle change" on the last line and using it in the 
<B>Total tilt angle offset</B> text box.
It is not necessary to do
this repeatedly because the final tilt angle offset will be determined
in a later processing step.
<P>
You can open the <B>Large Residual</B> page to see the list of
fiducials with the largest errors, but it is easier to deal with this
information from the Bead Fixer dialog in
<A HREF = "man/3dmod.html">3dmod</A>, which is opened when you press
<B>View/Edit Fiducial Model</B>.  In the Bead Fixer, press 
<B>Open a Tiltalign Log File</B> and select the appropriate log file.
Examine the points in turn by pressing the <B>Go to Next Big Residual</B>
button (or the apostrophe hot key), paying particular attention to ones with
errors greater than 2 pixels.  Adjust point positions in the
model, if appropriate.  When you want to recompute the alignment after fixing
some points, you can press <B>Save & Run Tiltalign</B>, which will save the
model, rerun <A HREF = "man/tiltalign.html">Tiltalign</A>, and read in the new
log file.  There is one trap to this convenience button: Bead Fixer has no way
of knowing if you have changed parameters in eTomo, so when you do change
alignment parameters, you must compute the alignment through the button in
eTomo instead.
<P>
You could also open the <B>Fiducial Coordinates</B> page to see the 3D
coordinates that have been solved for the fiducials, but it is easier to
visualize these points in 3dmodv by pressing the <B>View 3D Model</B>
button on the <B>Fine Alignment</B> panel.  If you indicated that points are
on two surfaces, then the points will be sorted into two objects based on
which surface <A HREF = "man/tiltalign.html">Tiltalign</A> thought they were
on.  This is a good way to assess whether the points are well enough
distributed on both surfaces to support solving for distortion, particularly
when local alignments are to be used.

<P>
<A NAME = "Background Grouping"><H4>
7.2. Background on Grouping Variables and Solving for Linear Distortion
</A></H4>
Before you get into trying to solve for linear distortion and grouping
variables, you should be aware of several points.  First, variables are
grouped in order to reduce the number of variables being solved for.
Instead of solving for a different tilt angle for each view, with grouping
by 5 the program will solve for a tilt angle for every fifth view and determine
the angle for the rest of the views from the ones that it is solving for.
This reduces the number of tilt variables being solved for by a factor of 5,
and also averages over a larger number of measurements when solving for
each individual value.  Because of this averaging out of random errors, 
grouping will actually give a more reliable solution for variables that are
hard to solve for, such as tilt angle near zero degrees.  It is for this
reason that you should always switch to grouping of tilt angles even when
you are not solving for distortion.  The reduction in number of variables by
grouping becomes particularly important when you have a large number of
fiducials (e.g., more than 150) or a large number of views (e.g., more than
140).  In these cases, the program may have trouble finding a solution
unless you also group some variables that are not grouped by default, namely
rotation angle and magnification.
<P>
The grouping of variables can be done in two different ways.  In one way,
the particular parameter will change linearly from the first view in one
group to the first view in the next group, and will appear to change
smoothly over the whole tilt series.  This is referred to as linear grouping
or linear mapping.  This method is used for every variable except stretch
along the X-axis.  For that variable, all of the views in a group will have
exactly the same value.
<P>
     The next point concerns the nature of the distortion solution, a
strange beast.  Even if the only thing happening to the section is a stretch
along the X-axis, solving for distortion will successfully account for these
changes, but the resulting solution will not numerically reproduce the
amount of stretch.  The problem is that there is an infinity of equivalent
solutions, which all account for the distortion equally well, but differ in
the geometry of the resulting reconstruction.  This geometric difference is a
"strain", a shifting in Z proportional to the X value of a column of
pixels.  Without additional information about the section, there is no way to
recover its true structure, and the actual amount of stretching that occurred.
The program needs to pick one solution out of the equivalent ones, and it does
so by eliminating one variable; thus you will notice a variable listed as
"dummy" in the <B>Mappings</B> page of the log file.
Typically, this arbitrarily selected
solution will change the most at high tilt angles, sometimes dramatically so,
even though the actual changes in the section happen at a nearly constant rate
through the series.
<P>
     The distortion solution will also account for thinning when tilt angle is
allowed to vary as well.  The equations governing this situation dictate that
the X-axis stretch change rapidly at the highest tilts, even if thinning
occurs at a regular rate through the series.  Thus, regardless of whether
there is section distortion or thinning, or both, it is almost inevitable that
the X-axis stretch will change most rapidly at high tilt.
<P>
The last point to be aware of is that some group sizes will vary with
tilt angle.  Group size for tilt angle will be
proportional to the cosine of the angle, and will be set so that the average
size equals the value that you specify for grouping.  Because of the peculiar
behavior of the X-axis stretch, its group size will change even more with tilt
angle.
<P>
     Finally, be aware that including distortion can lead the program into
inappropriate solutions, in which the tilt angle and the X-axis stretch covary
excessively.  This can occur when there are too few fiducials, too great an
imbalance between the number of fiducials on the two surfaces, substantial
random errors in the locations of the model points, or a ratio of measurements
to unknowns that is too low.  The potential remedies are to increase group
sizes, solve only for skew angle, or give up on solving for distortion.

<P>
<A NAME = "Distortion Two"><H4>
7.3. Solving for Distortion - Fiducials on Both Surfaces
</A></H4>
To solve for distortion, open the <B>Global Variables</B> page of the
<B>Fine Alignment</B> panel and select <B>Full solution</B> in the 
<B>Distortion Solution Type</B> section.  This will automatically switch
to some good default values 
if you have fiducials on both surfaces, namely a grouping of 5 for tilt
angles, 7 for the stretch variable, and 11 for the skew variable.
Grouping is important when solving for distortion because it dramatically
reduces the number of variables to be solved for, averages out random errors
better, and gives a more robust solution.  The typical range for group sizes
would be:
<UL>
<LI> 3 - 10 for tilt angles.
<LI> 5 - 10 for X-stretch.
<LI> 7 - 15 for skew angle.
</UL>
<P>
     You would want to pick the low end of these ranges of group sizes if an
alignment run reveals that one of the distortion variables changes especially
quickly (but don't be fooled by big changes for pictures taken out of
sequence).  Conversely, if the ratio of measurements to unknowns is lower
than 10-12, you would want to make
the default group sizes large.  In this case, you could also switch to grouping
rotation and magnification variables as well, provided that the solutions
for these variables already looks fairly smooth.
<P>
The stretch variable ("dmag" in the <B>Solution</B> page of the log file)
will typically range from 0.001 to 0.02 but
can easily reach 0.05 at high tilts.  If you get values larger than 0.05, or
if you get changes in tilt angle ("deltilt") more than 2 degrees,  you
should increase the group size and see if the range of values decreases,
particularly if you have only 3-5 fiducials on the surface with fewer
fiducials.  If the range decreases substantially, stick with the larger group
size.  You can also increase the grouping for skew and tilt angles to try
to get a better-behaved solution.  If a solution seems unreasonable, either
abandon the attempt to solve for distortion, or solve for skew angle only, as
described in a few paragraphs.
<P>
     The skew is an angle in degrees and will typically range from 0 to 1
degrees.  Values greater than about 0.2 degrees are worth correcting for, and
a change of more than about 0.3 degrees from one group to the next would be a
big change.
<P>
If you have discovered that there is some sudden change in alignment such
that two views should not be grouped together, then the simplest thing to 
do is to specify a <B>Separate view group</B> on the <B>General</B>
parameters page.  For example, if there is sudden change between views 30
and 31, enter 1-30 in this text box; more than one separate group can be
entered
if they are separated by spaces. 
<P>
A finer degree of control over grouping
of an individual variable can be achieved by making an entry in the
<B>Non-default groupings</B> text box that appears in Advanced mode for each
variable.  To use a non-default grouping, enter the starting and ending
view number and the group size, separated by commas.  For example,
if the default grouping for X-stretch is 10, but you
want smaller groups for the first and last 20 views of a 121-view tilt
series, then enter "1,20,5 102,121,5".  Separate different non-default
groupings with spaces, as in the example.
<P>
     A good alignment has a mean residual error of 0.25 to 0.5 pixels, or more
for larger gold particles or images acquired at smaller pixel sizes (less
than 1-1.5 nm).

<P>
<A NAME = "Distortion One"><H4>
7.4. Solving for Distortion - Fiducials on Only One Surface
</A></H4>
If you have fiducials on only one surface, or only a few fiducials on one
surface, you can't properly solve for
both tilt angle and distortion.  If the section has thinned but not distorted,
then allowing the tilt angles to vary will correct for the thinning.  If the
section has distorted but not thinned, then solving for distortion with fixed
tilt angles is appropriate.  In reality, both phenomena occur, and section sag
can also make the tilt angles inaccurate, so that fixing them
completely is likely to be problematic.  The simplest and safest thing to do
in this situation is not to solve for distortion, but some exploration of 
the distortion solution is worthwhile first.
<OL>
<LI> Select the full distortion solution, and set the grouping for tilt angles
to a large number (~30).  Compute an alignment and check the behavior of
the solution for "dmag" and "deltilt".  It 
is possible for tilt angle and stretch to
compensate for each other and give an artifactual solution, so if you see
relatively large values for both of these (e.g., greater than 2-3 degree tilt
angle change and x-stretch greater than 0.05-0.1),
don't trust the result.  Instead, do one of
the following:
<LI> If skew is not significant (say, less than 0.25 degrees), then don't
solve for distortion, and set the group size for tilt angles at 5 to
provide a better solution at low tilt angles.

<LI> If skew is significant, you have two options.  
One is to select <B>Fixed tilt angles</B>
and continue to solve for distortion, perhaps reducing the group size
accordingly.  If skew is no longer significant in this solution, abandon
solving for distortion as in the previous step; i.e., return to solving for
tilt angles with a group size of 5.
<LI> The second option with significant skew is to select <B>Skew only</B>
and return to grouping tilt angles by 5.

<A NAME = "Projection Stretch"><H4>

In some cases, distortions may occur because of stretching
along an axis during the projection of the images, instead of from
changes in the specimen.  To accommodate this situation, 
<A HREF = "man/tiltalign.html">Tiltalign</A><P> can solve for a single
image stretch that occurs in all images.  This is much easier than solving
for a specimen distortion that changes through the tilt series, and does not
require fiducials distributed in Z.  In Advanced mode, check <B>Solve for

7.6. Using Local Alignments
</A></H4>

     If you are reconstructing a large area, particularly if you are
montaging, then you may need to solve for local tilt alignments to get the
same quality of alignment and resulting resolution as you would with a smaller
area.
<A HREF = "man/tiltalign.html">Tiltalign</A>
first finds a global solution with all of the fiducials, then it adjusts the
solution to fit the fiducials in each of a series of overlapping subareas,
referred to as local patches.  The default size of the patches is determined
by the number of patches in each dimension and the amount of overlap
required between adjacent patches (50%, by default).  However, patches are
also required to contain a minimum number of fiducials, and each patch will
be automatically expanded from the default size until it contains that
number.  In fact,
there are two minimum requirements: one for the total number in an area, and
one for the number on each fiducial surface.  The latter requirement is
needed to ensure that there is enough information to 
obtain a valid local solution for distortion.
The typical result has been that a global mean residual of 0.75-1 is reduced
to about 0.5 in the local alignments.
<P>
To use local alignments, you should have at least 
8-12 fiducials per 1000 by 1000 pixel area 
acquired with a CCD camera, or
6-8 fiducials per 500 by 500 pixel area digitized from film.  Proceed as
follows: 
<OL>
<LI> Find a global solution using all of the fiducials, as described above.
Because you have many fiducials, you can make the grouping of variables for
tilt angles and distortion smaller than usual.  Reduce group sizes accordingly
but keep the ratio of measurements to unknowns fairly high (~15).
<LI> Check the <B>Enable local alignments</B> box on the <B>General</B>
parameters page.
<LI> The default number of patches, 5 by 5, is appropriate 
for unbinned data from a CCD camera up to 2000 pixels square.  For smaller
images, the numbers could be reduced, although this is not essential since
there is no harm in having more patches than necessary.  For
larger images, the numbers should definitely be increased.  A default patch
size of about 750 pixels is desirable for unbinned data from a CCD camera.
Assuming 50% overlap between patches, the number of patches in a dimension
should be set to 
<BR><CODE>
    2 * (image size) / (desired default patch size) - 1
<BR></CODE>
<LI> If you have fiducials on only one surface, or if you already know that
fiducials are not well enough distributed on both surfaces to provide for
local solutions for distortions, then set the <B>minimum number of 
fiducials</B> on each surface to 0 (the second of the two numbers in the

One sign of this is a tendency for the larger areas to have bigger errors.
You need either to reduce the number of

     The goal of the next step is to shift and rotate your reconstruction so
that it is as flat as possible and will fit into the smallest volume.  This is
done by sampling three regions of the tomogram, ones computed from near the
top, middle, and bottom of the tilt images.  There are two rotations which can
be adjusted: the rotation about the tilt axis, to make the section level when
viewed in the X-Z plane; and a rotation about the X axis, to make the section
come out at the same Z height throughout the length of the tomogram.  The
latter adjustment is optional for small rotations since it involves slightly
more computation time and
requires more interpolations in the back-projection, which could conceivably
reduce resolution.  The steps to follow are:
<OL>
<LI> Set the <B>Sample tomogram thickness</B> to a number at least 50%
bigger than the expected thickness of the section in the tomogram, so that
both the top and bottom boundaries of the section will show up in the
samples.  If you have fiducials
entirely or almost all on one surface, or if the surface analysis in the
alignment log file indicated a big tilt around the X-axis (e.g., more than 2
degrees), you may need double the expected section thickness.
<LI> Press <B>Create Sample Tomograms</B>.  Three samples will be generated,
named top.rec, mid.rec, and bot.rec (or topa.rec, etc.)
<LI> Press <B>Create Boundary Models</B>.  This will 
load all 3 sample tomograms into <A HREF = "man/3dmod.html">3dmod</A> and set up the proper filename for
the boundary model.
Model each edge of the section by drawing a line along
the boundary in one of the slices for a tomogram sample.
Just use two points, one on the left and one on the right side
of the tomogram.  You do not need to go all the way to the left and right 
edges since <A HREF = "man/tomopitch.html">Tomopitch</A> will extrapolate
from the line segment that you draw.
Put the lines for the top and bottom edges in separate
contours.  Use the "1" and "2" keys to switch between samples, and model
two contours in each sample in the same way.  When you are done, the model 
should have one object with six contours (two per sample), and two
points per contour.  Save the model.  
<LI> Press <B>Compute Pitch Angles & Z Shift</B> to run 
<A HREF = "man/tomopitch.html">Tomopitch</A> and then examine the 
log file.  The log file first shows an analysis of section position from
each of the three individual samples; you are mainly interested in the
information after that.  Which numbers you use depends on whether you
correct for X-axis tilt in the tomogram.  If you do, use the numbers in the
last three lines.
If the X-axis tilt is small (less

tomogram is going to be small, you can ignore the X-axis tilt, and use the
recommendations in the preceding two lines, before this tilt is taken into
account.

8.1. Redoing Samples with Z Shift or X-axis Tilt
</A></H4>
If your initial samples do not contain the entire section, which can easily
happen when fiducials are on only one surface, there are several
different courses of action.  The simplest is to increase the sample
thickness and recreate the sample tomograms.  However, you could choose to
shift the section up or down instead.  To do this, estimate the amount that
you need to shift the section, and insert this value in the <B>Total tilt
axis Z shift</B> text box (positive to shift up, negative to shift down).
Then press <B>Create Final Alignment</B> to incorporate this shift into the
current alignment, and recreate the sample tomograms.  Finally, you could 
solve the problem by creating samples with
X-axis tilt taken into account.  (You might want to do this even for your
initial samples if your alignment solution indicates a large X-axis tilt.)
To do this, follow these steps:

<B>Use whole tomogram</B> and select the desired binning, then press
<B>Create Whole Tomogram</B>.  When it is done and you press <B>Create

You now need to create pairs of lines delineating
the top and bottom of the specimen in at least 2 (preferably 3) locations in
Y.  The lines do not need to be perfectly horizontal (i.e., confined to one
plane in Y) and the two lines of a pair do not need to be at identical
locations.  See the man page for <A HREF = "man/tomopitch.html">Tomopitch</A>
for more details on acceptable boundary lines.
You have 3 options:
<OL>
<LI>Scroll through the X/Y planes in the Zap window and draw each line
by depositing points on the left and right sides of the tomogram at
appropriate Z levels.  Specifically, first pick a promising region in
Y.  Scroll through until you see the top of the section on the left
side, and deposit the first point of a contour there.  Then find the
slice that shows the comparable view of the top of the section on the
right, at about the same Y level, and add a point there.  Start a new
contour and repeat this procedure on the bottom of the section.  The
pick another two levels in Y and repeat the provedure of drawing top
and bottom lines at each.
<LI>Open a Slicer window, scroll in Z to one surface of the specimen,
and adjust X and Y rotation angles until the surface is flat.  Change Z
until you are just outside the surface.  Draw a horizontal line by adding
a point on the left then a point on the right side.
Draw two more lines at different Y levels (starting a new contour for each).
Go to the other surface and repeat.
<LI>Flip the tomogram to show the X/Z planes that ordinarily appear with 
3 samples (use the menu entry Edit-Image-Flip).  Pick slices where the
lines can be drawn and draw them as usual.
Be sure to start a
new contour for each line, since this will not happen
automatically in this situation as it does with 3 samples.

In each of these cases it is helpful to open the model view window before
starting to monitor the location of the lines.

9. TOMOGRAM GENERATION
</A></H3>
The tomogram generation process involves several steps at which
filtering can be applied to the data, and the appearance and interpretability
of the resulting tomogram depends on the choice of filtering.
All of this filtering involves the preferential attenuation of high spatial
frequencies, i.e., low pass filtering.  This kind of filtering reduces the 
noise in the reconstruction because noise becomes increasingly important at
higher spatial frequencies.  
Spatial frequencies are expressed in cycles
per pixel, ranging from 0 to 0.5, the highest spatial frequency that can be
represented in a digital image.

<A NAME = "Radial filter"><H4>
9.1. Tomogram Resolution and the Need for Filtering
</A></H4>
The noise or graininess in a reconstruction from
well-aligned data arises from two main sources:
noise 
in the projection images because they are not taken at very high dose; and 
artifacts in the back-projection because the tilt increment was too large
for the thickness of volume being reconstructed.  The angular increment is
one of the major factors governing the resolution of a tomogram.  The
classic resolution formula of Crowther,
DeRosier, and Klug (1970) can provide a rough guide for how to adjust
the radial filter, even though it is strictly applicable only to the case of a
full 180&ordm; range of angles.  The formula is:
<pre>
    d = D * &#916;&#946;
where d is the resolution in real-space units (nm or pixels), 
      D is the diameter of volume reconstructed, 
  and &#916;&#946; is the angular increment in radians.  
</pre>
Alternatively, if &#916;&#946; is in degrees, the resolution f in 
reciprocal-space (frequency) units is
<pre>
    f = 57.3 / (D * &#916;&#946;)
</pre>

Or, the equation can be expressed in terms of n, the number of views, and
the maximum tilt angle &#946;<sub>max</sub>:
<pre>
    f = (28.5 * n) / (D * &#946;<sub>max</sub>)
</pre>
which for the case of a tilt range of &plusmn;60&ordm;, reduces to:
<pre>
    f = 0.48 * n / D
</pre>
One of the uncertainties in these formulas is the meaning of the diameter D.
In rough terms it corresponds to the thickness of the section; but if
electron-dense material in the section is relatively sparse, it may
correspond more closely to the size of clusters of material within the
section, implying a higher resolution.  It has been argued that in extended
slabs of material, D corresponds to the maximum thickness of the section
when tilted, but a formula based on this assumption
gives resolutions much too low to be a guide for filtering the reconstruction.
The last version of the formula implies that the angular increment does not
limit the resolution when the number
of views is comparable to the section thickness in pixels.  This makes
intuitive sense if one thinks of the projections as providing information
needed to solve for densities in the volume, since then the number of
measurements will match the number of unknowns.

<A NAME = "Filtering Options"><H4>
9.2. Filtering Options
</A></H4>
The first step with a choice that affects filtering of the data is the
generation of the aligned stack, which can be done with either cubic or
linear interpolation.  Although the default cubic interpolation does
attenuate the highest frequencies to some extent, linear interpolation has a
noticeably greater filtering effect.  The effect is broad-band and mild: it
becomes significant at frequencies as low as 0.2 cycle/pixel but even the
highest frequencies are attenuated by only a factor of about 2-3, rather than
eliminated as in most filtering.  Linear interpolation is a good first stage
for filtering when the data are particularly noisy, such as in cryotomography.
<P>
After the aligned stack is made, it can be filtered explicitly with a
two-dimensional Gaussian filter in Fourier space.  Spatial frequencies up to a
specified cutoff radius are unaffected, and beyond that radius they are
attenuated by multiplying with a Gaussian curve that starts at 1.0 at the
cutoff radius and falls off with a specified sigma value (standard deviation).
The Gaussian falls to 0.61, 0.14, and 0.01 at 1, 2, and 3 sigmas, respectively.
The advantage of filtering the aligned stack is that it will reduce noise in
both dimensions; the disadvantage is that it requires an extra computational
step.
<P>
The third stage at which filtering can be applied is during the
backprojection.  
In R-weighted backprojection,
each horizontal line of input data is filtered to weight each spatial
frequency proportional to its radius in Fourier space.  This is radial
weighting, and the filter is referred to as a radial filter.  When graphed,
it is simply a straight line through the origin.  In order to
filter out high frequencies in the reconstruction, a cutoff frequency is
defined at which the filter changes from a rising line to a falling Gaussian
curve.  The rate of the falloff is again determined by the sigma
of the Gaussian.  The advantage of filtering at this stage is that it adds no
extra steps because it is incorporated in the R-weighting.  However, it is only
a one-dimensional filter.  This makes it well suited for reducing the
artifacts and noise due to the limitations on angular sampling, but less
well-suited for dealing with other noise because it fails to filter noise in
the Y direction.  Indeed, experiments with noisy model data indicate that 
optimal 2D filtering of the aligned stack gives a more faithful reproduction
of the original structure than does radial filtering in the backprojection
with the same cutoff and sigma values.

<A NAME = "Filtering Guidelines"><H4>
9.3. Filtering Guidelines
</A></H4>
These various considerations motivate the following guidelines:
<UL>
<LI> The default filter for both the 2D and radial filtering, with a cutoff of
0.35 and a rolloff of 0.05 cycle/pixel, is generally adequate when the section
thickness in pixels is
up to 2 times the number of views and the input data are not very noisy.
With the default filter, it will not make much difference whether you use 2D
filtering or the radial filter.
<LI> The cutoff can be made higher, such as 0.4 or 0.45, if the ratio of
thickness to projections is close to 1, and if the input data are not very
noisy.  This may not make much difference for unbinned data from a CCD
camera but could be worthwhile for higher resolution binned CCD images or
data from film. 
<LI> If the ratio of thickness to number of views is higher than two, the
data should probably be filtered more than the default.  Do this filtering
in 2D instead of with the radial filter.  Reduce the cutoff
frequency to values like 0.3 and 0.25.  Do not reduce the rolloff as this will
produce more ringing and ripples; in fact, it may be advantageous to increase
the rolloff value so that 3 sigmas are still reached at 0.5 cycle/pixel (e.g.,
to 0.065 for a cutoff of 0.3, or 0.08 for a cutoff of 0.25).
<LI> If the input data are particularly noisy, linear interpolation should be
used, and the filter cutoff may need to 
be set lower than the previous points would suggest.
<LI>If you decide to bin the aligned stack to deal with excessive noise and
limited resolution, the filtering requirements will be
much reduced. 
</UL>
These guidelines are just a starting point, and the best approach may be to
experiment with different filter settings to find the best balance between
reduced graininess and sharpness of features in the tomogram.

do this to see the effects of varying the radial filter, or to see the
results with different alignment parameters.  These assessments can
usually be done on a subset of the data.  You can make a subset by
reducing the thickness, entering a <B>Tomogram width in X</B> that is
less than that of the
projection images, specifying a <B>First slice in Y</B> and a

trial tomogram, you can select the name that appears in the drop-down
box, and press <B>View Trial in 3dmod</B> to see whichever tomogram is

which will rotate the reconstruction about the Y axis just as the
angle offset will in the Fine Alignment step.  In addition, there is
an entry for <B>Z offset</B> that has the same effect as the 
<B>Z shift</B> specified earlier.  These entries are useful when
doing an alignment without fiducials.  Do not use them when
working on a dual-axis tomogram, because they will make the initial

<P>
<A NAME = "Z factors"><H4>
9.6. Using Z Factors in the Backprojection
</A></H4>
When a specimen shrinks along an oblique axis during a tilt series, it is
actually not possible to transform the 2D images to correct fully for this
shrinkage.  That is, the aligned images will not represent projections of
an unchanging rotated object.  The result is that features such as gold
fiducials do not stay at one Y level in the aligned images, producing
characteristic artifacts in the reconstruction.  This effect can be
corrected by varying the
location that voxels in the reconstruction backproject from systematically
as a function of their Z-height.  Since IMOD 3.4.17, 
<A HREF = "man/tiltalign.html">Tiltalign</A>
can output the factors needed to adjust the backprojection position when
distortion is solved for, and
<A HREF = "man/tilt.html">Tilt</A> can use them when computing the
reconstruction.  These factors will be used if present when the
<B>Use Z factors</B> box is checked in the <B>Tilt Parameters</B> section
of the <B>Tomogram Generation</B> panel.  The box is checked by default,
under the assumption that the distortion solution in the fine alignment will 
usually reflect changes in the specimen rather than stretches during
imaging.  However, in situations where imaging is a more likely source of
stretch, the option should be turned off.

<P>
Go through the following steps to set up the combination:
<OL>
<LI> Decide which tomogram will be transformed to match the other.
Typically, the "b" set is matched to the "a" set.
However, if the section is appreciably flatter in one tomogram, then
the other one should be matched to that one.
<LI> If you have fiducials on only one surface, note whether one tomogram
is upside down relative to the other, and select the appropriate radio
button to indicate that fiducials are on one side and whether the tomograms
are inverted relative to each other or not.  Notice that there are also
options for using models of corresponding points either alone or together with
fiducials; for details on using these options see
<A HREF = "tomoExtra.html#Fiducialless Combine">
Combining Tomograms with Few or No Fiducials</A> in the Extra Topics section.
<LI> 
Enter the lists of corresponding fiducial points in the <B>Corresponding
fiducial list</B> text boxes.  Specifically, enter the list of points from "a" which
have corresponding points in "b", and the list of corresponding points
in "b".  
The lists output by <A HREF = "man/transferfid.html">Transferfid</A> should
be usable if you have not deleted any fiducial points.  (The log file from
running <A HREF = "man/transferfid.html">Transferfid</A> is available in the
right button popup menu.)  If these lists are no longer accurate, just
specify the subset of correspondences that you are confident
of.  <A HREF = "man/solvematch.html">Solvematch</A>
can be given a small list of fiducials that are known to
correspond and it will find the remaining correspondences.  There are two
restrictions on this ability: you must give it at least 4 correspondences to
start with (5 is recommended); and if you have fiducials on both surfaces, you
must include at least one from each surface.
<LI>
Decide what size patches to use in Patchcrawl3D.  Ideally, this
decision would be based on how much high frequency information is in the
tomograms and on how well the two volumes seem to agree with each other, but
these features are difficult to assess.  In the initial creation of the
command files, there are three built-in sizes available, small, medium, and
large.  Small patches should be adequate for
relatively high-resolution tomograms from film, while the medium patches are
more appropriate for data from a CCD camera.  If the tomograms seem
particularly fuzzy, go up one size in either case.  Once you have created
the command files, you can adjust these sizes in the <B>Final Match</B> page
if necessary.
<LI> Try to determine if there are regions within the section that should
not be used for correlating the tomograms because they are either empty of
material or contain reconstruction of poor quality.  You can exclude such
areas from consideration in two ways.  One way is to set more restrictive
lower and upper limits in X and Y on the region from which patches will be
extracted by <A HREF = "man/patchcrawl3d.html">Patchcrawl3d</A>.
Take note of the coordinates in X and Y beyond
which the image is unreliable in the tomogram being matched TO, and adjust
the entries in the X or Y axis min or max text boxes.
The other way is to draw one or more model contours completely enclosing the
patches that you want included in the analysis.  Select <B>Use patch region
model</B> and press the <B>Create/Edit Patch Region Model</B> button.  This
will open the tomogram being matched to and define an appropriate file name
for the patch region model.
See the man page for
<A HREF = "man/refinematch.html">Refinematch</A>
for details.  Do not worry about identifying regions in this
tomogram that are outside the bounds of the other tomogram; 
<A HREF = "man/patchcrawl3d.html">Patchcrawl3d</A> will
take care of this limitation.

<P>
If you have a relatively thin sample, you should be aware that Setupcombine
may decide to compute only one layer of patches, in which case the second
stage of alignment will not stretch the data in the thickness dimension.
This is generally appropriate, but you may wish to change this by going to
the <B>Final Match</B> page, switching to Advanced mode, and specifying two
layers of patches in Z.  Adjust the size of the patches in Z if necessary so
that it is at least 30% smaller than the range allowed for the patches in Z.
<P>
If you have noisy tomograms, you should probably use linear interpolation
(instead of the default quadratic) for making the final matching volume with
<A HREF = "man/matchorwarp.html">Matchorwarp</A>.  To do this, go to Advanced
mode on the <B>Final Match</B> page and select <B>Use linear interpolation</B>.

<A NAME = "Temporary Combining Storage"><H4>
10.2. Using Temporary Storage for Combining
</A></H4>
It is possible to use temporary disk space when combining two tomograms;
this is useful if you want to run the combine operation on a machine different
from the one where the two tomograms are located.  Combining creates a large
number of temporary files, and considerable time can be saved by placing these
files on a local disk instead of writing and reading them across a network.
To use this feature, make an entry in the <B>Temporary directory</B> text
box (/tmp, /usr/tmp,
or other appropriate scratch directory).  If you may need to access this
directory from other machines, do not use /tmp or /usr/tmp, and specify the
scratch directory in a way that will be recognized from another machine.
(In the BL3DEMC, that means using /scratch/machine_name instead of
/localscratch).  
Whatever directory you specify must exist already and you must
have permission to write to it.  By default,
the command files will build the final
sum.rec into the current directory and remove all temporary files at the end.
Select <B>Manual cleanup</B> if you want the fastest possible access to
sum.rec or if you want to examine the setname.mat file.  With this option,
sum.rec is built in the temporary directory and a link is provided to it
from the current directory.
<P>
The temporary directory is created when matchvol1.com is run.  If the
combine operation crashes and has to be restarted, it will use the same
directory.  However, if you recreate the command files, a new
temporary directory will be used.

Press <B>Create Combine Scripts</B> to generate the command files based on
the parameters in the <B>Setup</B> page.  After this, the <B>Initial
Match</B> and <B>Final Match</B> pages will be accessible, and you can go to
them to adjust parameters if
you have special needs based on prior experience.  Some parameters can also
be changed from the setup page, but some parameter changes there
will not have any effect unless you recreate the command files.
<P>
Check free disk space (df -k). Typically, you need 3 times as much free
space as one tomogram occupies.  You may need to delete the aligned tilt
series, which you can do with the <B>Delete Aligned Image Stack</B>
button on the <B>Tomogram Generation</B> panel.  (Deleting the pre-aligned 
stacks will also help, but this currently must be done from the command line.)
You may even need to 
archive and delete raw tilt series before proceeding.
<P>
Press <B>Start Combine</B> to start the operation.  Once the matchorwarp
operation has been running for a minute, 
check the matchorwarp.log file to see how good the registration between the two
volumes is.
You
will see <A HREF = "man/refinematch.html">Refinematch</A>'s
report on the mean and maximum deviation at the various
locations after applying a single linear transformation.  Then there will be
either a message that <A HREF = "man/matchvol.html">Matchvol</A>
 is being run, or a message that warping is
needed.  In the latter case, <A HREF = "man/findwarp.html">Findwarp</A>
may run several times; just above a
message that <A HREF = "man/warpvol.html">Warpvol</A>
 is being run next will be a report on the mean and
maximum of the mean residuals.  If the mean is reasonable but the maximum is
quite high (1 or more), 
you should look at the patch vector model
and consider whether to take any of the remedial
actions described below.

<P>
<A NAME = "Initial Problems in Combining"><H4>
10.4. Initial Registration Problems in Combining
</A></H4>
If the combine operation fails right away, this is probably because of a bad
correspondence between fiducial points, but might also occur with large
volumes that have substantial nonlinear distortion between the two tomograms.
To distinguish these two situations, examine the solvematch log file, which 
will usually offer some advice based on the mean and maximum
residuals of the fit between points.
If the mean is fairly large
(around 4 as opposed to 1), and the maximum is not very large (less than
20), this is a sign that the fiducial positions do not fit a linear
transformation very well because of
distortions.  In this case, enter a number higher than the maximum residual
in the <B>Residual threshold</B> text box on the <B>Initial Match</B> page.
Then press the <B>Restart Combine</B> button to start over from the beginning.
<P>
In contrast, if the maximum residual is very high (say, higher than 20),
this is a sign that there is a bad correspondence between points.  Usually
the mean residual will be relatively low, but if there are many points out
of correspondence, it could very large.
<A HREF = "man/solvematch.html">Solvematch</A> can eliminate some bad
pairs of points, but not more than 10% of the points.
When this happens, 
you should change the <B>Corresponding fiducial lists</B> 
so that they specify only a few points which you are sure correspond.
<P>
If you have a data set where the alignment was run on an older version
of IMOD (before 3.2.21), solvematch.com will run a script,
<A HREF = "man/matchshifts.html">Matchshifts</A>
to find the shift
between the two tomograms.  This operation can fail.  If so, the easiest thing
to do is to rerun the fine alignment for both axes, so that
the fiducial coordinate files will contain the information that 
<A HREF = "man/solvematch.html">Solvematch</A> needs to find the shifts
directly.

<P>
<A NAME = "Patch Problems in Combining"><H4>
10.5. Patch Correlation Problems in Combining
</A></H4>
If combine.com exits because neither 
<A HREF = "man/refinematch.html">Refinematch</A>
 nor <A HREF = "man/findwarp.html">Findwarp</A> could find
a fit to the patch displacements with a sufficiently low mean residual, then
there are several possible reasons.  The patches could be too
small, leading to widespread random errors.  There could be local regions in 
the volume where a relatively high proportion of patches have large errors, a
situation that the outlier elimination algorithm in 
<A HREF = "man/findwarp.html">Findwarp</A> cannot handle.
Finally, there could be inaccurate displacements only along one or more edges
of the volume.  To assess this situation, the first step is to 
examine the model of the patch displacements by pressing 
<B>Examine Patch Vector Model</B>.
This model shows each displacement as a line whose
length is 10
times the actual length of the displacement.
Spin the model slowly and zoom as
needed to see the pattern of displacement vectors.  

<P>
Consider the following steps in sequence:
<OL>
<LI> <I>Make bigger patches.</I>  If there are many lines that do not fit
the pattern of surrounding lines, scattered around the whole volume, then
you should rerun the
patch correlation 
with larger patches.  On the <B>Final Match</B> page, you can either either
enter new sizes in the <B>Patch size</B> text boxes or press 
<B>Patch Size +20%</B> to increase each dimension by 20%.
This will increase the 
volume of the patches by a factor of 1.73 and substantially improve
accuracy, although in some cases two increases may be needed.
Press <B>Restart at Patchcorr</B> to continue.

<LI> <I>Exclude regions of patches with a model.</I>  If displacements generally look fairly regular but there are a large 
number of bad patches in well-defined regions, it may be easiest to make a
model with contours enclosing the regions with good patches, or to modify
such a model if you have already made one.  To do this while looking at the
patch vector model, press <B>Create/Edit Patch Region Model</B>, which
will load the tomogram being matched to into
a separate <A HREF = "man/3dmod.html">3dmod</A>,
and try to correlate positions between the tomogram and the patch vector model.
Be sure to check <B>Use Patch Region Model</B>, then press 
<B>Restart at Matchorwarp</B>.  If <A HREF =
"man/findwarp.html">Findwarp</A> still fails, you probably need to edit
patches as described next.  Note that if you have just added a patch
region model, the patch vector model will still show bad patches outside of
the region contours (and thus not a problem) unless you rerun patchcorr to
generate new patches that are constrained to be within the region.

<LI> <I>Edit out scattered bad patches.</I>  If bad patches are fairly 
scattered and not too numerous, it is most appropriate to edit them out.  To
do this, press the <B>Examine Patch Vector Model</B> button.
Position the mouse on an aberrant
vector in the model
view window and press the third mouse button to make this vector be
the current contour for editing.  It should display as a thicker line; if a
different vector shows up as thick, reposition and click again.  (If no vector
shows up as thick, open the Edit-Objects dialog, select Lines, and turn on
<B>Thicken current contour</B>.)
Delete the contour with the "D" hotkey.
When finished, save the model and exit.  
Then press <B>Replace Patch Vectors</B> and <B>Restart at Matchorwarp</B>.

<LI> <I>Eliminate rows or columns.</I>  If the patch vector model indicates that bad patches are numerous near
edges of the volume, next explore whether omitting
a whole column or row of patches will give an acceptable fit to
the remaining patches.  To do this, make entries in the 
<B>Number of columns to exclude on ...</B> text boxes, press
<B>Matchorwarp Trial Run</B>, then examine the matchorwarp log file.
Do this repeatedly to assess different row or column exclusions.
If you find an exclusion that gives a good fit, and the excluded area is not
a critical area where you would expect a better fit, then proceed with this
exclusion.  Just press <B>Restart at Matchorwarp</B> to finish combining.

<LI> <I>Just go on.</I>  Sometimes the lowest mean residual that
Findwarp is able to achieve (the last message in matchorwarp.log saying
 "Findward failed to find
a warping with a mean residual below") is actually an acceptable value, just a
bit higher than the highest acceptable mean residual specified in
matchorwarp.com.  If
this is the case, just change the highest value in the <B>Warp limit</B>
text box to be higher than the value shown in this message.  Press
<B>Restart at Matchorwarp</B> and the combine should run to completion.

<LI> <I>Run Findwarp interactively.</I>  If all else fails, it may help to run 
<A HREF = "man/findwarp.html">Findwarp</A>
interactively.  This will allow you to explore omitting
columns or rows of patches as well as select the number of patches that will
be used in each local fit.
See the man page for 
<A HREF = "man/findwarp.html">Findwarp</A>.
When running the program, examine results with
transformations based on various subsets of patches, but no fewer than 3 by 3
by 2 or 4 by 2 by 2.  Try to retain all of the rows and columns if possible.
Use the largest subset of patches that will give a mean residual error under
about 0.3 pixels.  Save the transformations in a file named warp.xf.
Once you have done this, you can finish the combine operation by entering
<CODE><BR>
   subm warpvol volcombine

<A NAME = "Linen Pattern"><H4>
10.6. Linen Patterns in the Combined Tomogram
</A></H4>
Some combined tomograms show a pattern of vertically
and horizontally oriented lines that we refer to as "linen".  This pattern
can appear when the reconstructions are particularly noisy or when the
registration between them is not very good.  In a 2D Fourier transform, it
shows up as greater power near the X and Y axes than between the axes.
In the 3D Fourier transform, the pattern shows up as greater power in 
locations where
data were taken from only one tomogram (locations in the missing wedge of the
other tomogram) than in locations where data were averaged from the two
tomograms.  Apparently, when data from the
two tomograms do not agree very well, because of either noise or misalignment,
the averaging reduces the Fourier amplitude significantly.  The solution to
this problem is to reduce the amplitudes of data taken from only one tomogram
to match the amplitudes of data averaged from both.  Since this is a filtering
operation, it does not happen by default.
<P>
The reduce amplitudes, go to Advanced mode on the <B>Final Match</B> page
and enter 1 in the text box for <B>Reduction factor for matching amplitudes
in combined FFT</B>.  A value of 1 should improve the linen pattern;
smaller
or larger values will give less or more reduction.
See the man page for 
<A HREF = "man/combinefft.html">Combinefft</A> for more details.
Press <B>Restart at Volcombine</B> to recompute the combined volume.
<P>
If the text box is disabled, you have an older version of

scripts, then restart at volcombine.com.

<A NAME = "Scaling and Trimming"><H4>
11.1. Scaling and Trimming a Tomogram
</A></H4>
The <B>Volume Trimming</B> section of the <B>Post-processing</B> panel
uses <A HREF = "man/trimvol.html">Trimvol</A> to
trim a volume and convert it to
bytes.  This shell script can run 
<A HREF = "man/findcontrast.html">Findcontrast</A>
to find optimal contrast settings for
converting it to bytes, runs Newstack to make the final byte file, and can
also use "clip flipyz" to swap the Y and Z dimensions of the data, which
will make the final volume easier to work with in <A HREF = "man/3dmod.html">3dmod</A>.  All of these
operations are performed with the default settings when you open the panel.
<P>
If you want to trim the volume in X and Y, you can use the rubberband feature
in the Zap window to draw a box around the region of interest and then have
eTomo collect this information.  
Press <B>3dmod Full Volume</B> to load the tomogram into <A HREF = "man/3dmod.html">3dmod</A>.  In <A HREF = "man/3dmod.html">3dmod</A>, 
press the
dotted rectangle in the Zap toolbar to turn on the rubberband.  Press the
first mouse button at the upper left corner of the desired area, and hold it
down while dragging to the lower right corner.  After the rubberband is set,
press <B>Get XY Volume Range from 3dmod</B> in the eTomo
<B>Post-processing</B> panel to fill in the <B>X min</B>, <B>X max</B>, 
<B>Y min</B>, and <B>Y max</B> text boxes.
<P>
If you
simply convert a tomogram to bytes without a contrast setting, then the
contrast range for features of interest can be quite compressed and it can be
difficult to adjust contrast for viewing in <A HREF = "man/3dmod.html">3dmod</A>.  You can avoid this problem
by saturating the intensities of gold particles (and other irrelevant features
like stain precipitate) when converting to bytes.  There are two different
methods for determining a good contrast scaling.
<P>
First, load the tomogram into <A HREF = "man/3dmod.html">3dmod</A> to determine the starting and
ending slices of a range that excludes features whose intensity can be
saturated.  Findcontrast will ignore areas within 10% of the edges of these
slices.  Select the <B>Find scaling from sections</B> radio button and 
enter these slice numbers into the associated <B>Z min</B> and <B>Z max</B>
text boxes.  If you want to trim the volume, note the first and last section
that you want to keep, as well as limiting coordinates near the left, right,
bottom, and top edges if you want to trim the lateral size of the volume.
Change the entries in the <B>Volume Range</B> section as desired.
<P>
Do not be satisfied if the trimmed volume does not have a good dynamic range
for specimen features, e.g., if it
requires Black and White sliders settings less than 100 units apart to get good
contrast in <A HREF = "man/3dmod.html">3dmod</A>.  This can happen if there
is gold or stain precipitate in the sampled slices.  When this happens,
select
the <B>Scale to match contrast</B> radio button instead and find the
appropriate settings in <A HREF = "man/3dmod.html">3dmod</A>.
The simplest
way to do this is to adjust the Black and White sliders in <A HREF = "man/3dmod.html">3dmod</A> to
give the desired brightness and contrast
and enter the values in the <B>black</B> and <B>white</B> text boxes.  
However, this could truncate intensities inappropriately.  
For full control over the truncation of intensities, use the following
procedure.
Move both contrast sliders to
the same position.  While movieing through the data, adjust the positions of
both sliders together until only the gold beads (and other irrelevant
features) show up as black pixels; this slider value is the lower contrast
limit.  Then adjust both sliders so that only the overshoots around the beads
show up as white pixels; this slider value is the upper contrast limit.
Enter these
limits into the <B>black</B> and <B>white</B> text boxes.

<A NAME = "Squeezing"><H4>
11.2. Squeezing a Tomogram
</A></H4>
     If your images were acquired on a CCD camera with limited spatial
resolution, you may be able to reduce the size of the final volume
considerably with no perceptible loss of image detail.  
The <B>Squeeze Volume</B> section of the <B>Post-processing</B> panel
provides an easy interface for scaling a volume down by
interpolation using 
<A HREF = "man/matchvol.html">Matchvol</A>.  The squeezing is specified
by two reduction factors, one applied in X and Y, the other applied in Z.
The default values are the same, but
since resolution is worse in the 
Z direction, it could be appropriate to squeeze the volume more in that
dimension.  For example, if the CCD camera provides no useful information
above 0.8 of Nyquist, an overall reduction by 1.2 or 1.25 would be
appropriate, and a reduction 1.3 times higher in the Z dimension would also be
appropriate
given the extra point-spread in that dimension in a tomographic
reconstruction.  Squeezing by 1.25 in X and Y and 1.62 in Z will reduce
the size of the volume by a factor of 2.5.  Squeezing isotropically by 1.2
will reduce the volume by a factor of 1.73.
<P>
Press <B>Squeeze Volume</B> to perform the operation on the trimmed volume.
The output file has the extension .sqz.
<P>
If you choose anistropic squeezing, you need to
increase the Z-scale that you use for viewing models built on that
volume
by the amount of extra squeezing in that dimension.  For example, if
you have a Z-scale of 1.6 before squeezing, you would need a Z-scale of 2.07
(1.6 * 1.62 / 1.25) after squeezing by 1.25 in X/Y and 1.62 in Z.  If you are
computing the Z-scale by comparing the thickness of the section in the
squeezed volume with the original thickness at which the section was cut, then
<pre>
   Z-scale = O / (S * P)
   where  O = original section thickness, in nm
          S = thickness of section in squeezed volume, in pixels 
          P = pixel size in X and Y after squeezing, in nm
</pre>

<A NAME = "Cleaning Up"><H3>
12. CLEAN UP
</A></H3>
Cleaning up your files is very important!  The
<B>Intermediate File Cleanup</B> panel makes cleanup easy.  The philosophy here
is to remove all intermediate image files and volcombine.log, but to
leave model files, command files, other log files, and files with
transformations and other information.  
To make it easier to
see which intermediate files will be deleted, do the cleanup in two
stages by first setting the <B>Files of Type</B> filter to <B>Backup
files</B>,
selecting all files in the window with Ctrl-A, and pressing <B>Delete
Selected</B>.  Next set the filter back to <B>Intermediate files</B>
and delete them, retaining some if desired.
<P>
If you want a copy of one
of the aligned tilt series, then before cleaning up, reduce this stack
to bytes and float the intensities with:
<BR><CODE>
     newstack -mo 0 -fl 2 setname.ali name_of_tilt_series_file
<BR></CODE>
<P>
Finally, archive and delete the raw image stacks.  If you lack the
ability to burn DVDs, the shell script
<A HREF = "man/splitmrc.html">Splitmrc</A>
can be used to divide a very 
large MRC file into pieces that will fit
on multiple CDs; <A HREF = "man/recombine.html">Recombine</A>
can be used later to put the pieces back together.
