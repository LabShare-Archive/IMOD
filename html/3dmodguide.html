  <h3>Model Organization</h3>
It is helpful to understand the model data structure before trying
to create a model. A model is basically a collection of points that
refer to or mark
interesting locations in an image.
These points are stored in groups that are called contours. In the
simplest case, a contour is a closed boundary around a region in an
image. However, you should think of a contour more generally as a set
of associated points, which may or may not be connected by lines.
You will typically want to keep track of more than one type
of feature in an image. This is facilitated by allowing contours to be
grouped together into separate objects. Each object can be given its
own
name and all contours in the object share common attributes such as
color and line thickness. This table shows how
objects, contours, and points are organized in a hierarchy in the
model.

<p>To create a model for a MRC image file called <code>example.mrc</code>
run the following 3dmod command.
This command will cause a new model to be created, ready to edit.
<br>
<code>3dmod example.mrc</code>
</p>
<p>If a model has already been saved but needs further editing run the
command
<br>
<code>3dmod example.mrc example.mod</code>
</p>
<p>When this command is run a window similar to the one below will open
up.
A secondary window containing the image of the image file and model
file is opened after the data has been loaded.<br>
</p>
<p>Note that the files used for the examples shown below, <code>dual.rec</code>
and <code>example.mod</code>, are among the <a
 href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/files/imod_data.tar.gz">sample
data files</a> available from our web site.<br>

<p><a name="Information Window">
<h3>The Information Window</h3>
</a> </p>
<center> <img src="3dmodimages/infowin.png"
 alt="3dmod Information Window"> </center>
The 3dmod Information Window above is the main control window of the
program. It contains menus for performing file operations, selecting
model editing functions, and
opening various kinds of image windows.
It displays information about the
model and the current image point. There are also some controls that
govern the overall behavior of the program, and a status pane where
messages
are printed. Let us consider it from the top down.
<p>The title bar of the Info Window shows the name of the image file
and
also contains controls for minimizing the window or closing it, which
is a quick way to exit the program.
Below the menu line are some buttons that control window behavior, with
the name of the current model file shown on the right. The peg
button allows you to keep the Info Window on top of windows from all
other programs. The raise button (two up arrows) will bring all of
the windows of the current 3dmod above windows from other programs.
The buttons with the curved arrows will undo or redo changes to the
model.
The "Show point" button will be explained in a moment.
</p>
<p>Below these buttons are a set of controls called spin boxes, which
are
now used extensively in 3dmod. A spin box shows a current value of some
parameter, and lets you change that parameter either by increasing or
decreasing it with the up and down arrow buttons, or by typing in a
new value. The three spin boxes on the left
show the current model object, contour and point, as well as the color
of
the current object.
The model being edited above has 4 objects; the 4th object
is currently selected. The 4th object has 11 contours and
the 5th contour is currently selected. This contour has 20 points and
the 10th point
is the current point. </p>
<p>Generally, when you change object, contour, or
point with one of these spin boxes, the program will show the new
current point in the image windows and change the section being
displayed if necessary. Sometimes you will not want this to happen,
such as when you want to switch between objects without having the
displayed section change. In that case, just turn off the "Show
point" checkbox.
</p>
<p>The three spin boxes on the right are the image position controls.
They show that the image dimensions are 572 by 378 and that
there are 31 sections. The current image point is at the location
(237,259) with the origin at the lower left corner of the image. The
current section is number 16. If you change the Z value, a different
section will be shown in image windows. You can change X and Y values
to move the current image point. The current image point is not the
same as the current model point. It is marked by a cross when the
program is not in model mode, and it determines what coordinates are
displayed in some of the image windows.
</p>
<p>At the bottom of the Info Window are the Black and White sliders,
which you
can use to adjust the contrast and
brightness of the displayed image. Pixel values between the selected
black and
white levels (147 and 234) are stretched out to occupy the full dynamic
range
of the
display. Moving the sliders toward each other will increase contrast,
while moving one or both to the left will increase brightness. </p>
<p> These
sliders have features common to nearly all of the slider controls in
3dmod. Clicking to one side of the handle with the left mouse button
will change the value by one. Clicking with the middle mouse button
will jump the slider to the position of the mouse pointer. Dragging
the handle by clicking and holding the left mouse button will cause
the image contrast to be
continuously updated until you release the button. In other words,
these sliders are continuously active, or "hot". Sometimes the program
will not perform well when a slider is continuously active, such as
with very large images or models. You can keep a slider from being
hot by holding down the C<!---->trl key (Apple key on the Macintosh).
When
you do this, the numeric value will be continuously displayed but the
image will not be updated until you release the slider.
</p>
<p>Below the sliders are several controls related to setting the
contrast.
</p>
<ul>
  <li> When the "Float" box is checked,
the program will adjust the black and white sliders automatically when
you change from one section to another in an attempt to maintain a
constant contrast and brightness between the images. </li>
  <li> The "Auto" button is for setting contrast automatically; when
you
press it the program will adjust the black and white sliders so that
the
displayed image has a defined mean and standard deviation. The settings
for the target mean and standard deviation can be changed in the
3dmod Preferences dialog box, available from the Edit-Options menu
entry.
For example, you could increase the target mean to make images
brighter,
or reduce the standard deviation to make images have less contrast. </li>
  <li> When the "Subarea" box is checked, both the "Float" operation
when
going between sections and the "Auto" contrast-setting operation
will be performed using only the image area displayed in the Zap
window. </li>
</ul>
<p>
The "Movie" and "Model" radio buttons allow a user to select one
of the two modes. When "Movie" is selected, pressing the middle or
right
mouse button will
cause the image
to movie back and forth. When "Model" is selected, the three different
mouse
buttons will edit the model, as described below.
</p>
<p>The bottom panel of the Info Window contains
additional information and status messages. You can expand the window
vertically to see more of the information at once.

The main image display and model editing window within 3dmod
is the "Zap" window. The window name is an acronym for
"Zoom and Pan".
The zoom can be adjusted by clicking with the left mouse button on the
arrows at the
left side of the toolbar.
Alternatively, one can zoom up and down with the "=" and "-" hot keys,
respectively.
To pan the image when it is larger than the window, press and hold the
left
mouse
button in the image area of the window and
drag the image.
</p>
<p>This display of two nearby slices from a tomogram (sections 12 and
16) illustrates the three kinds of model objects: closed
contours, open contours, and scattered points.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Closed contours are
used to draw closed boundaries around features in one image plane.
The light blue lines following the membrane around a vesicle are an
example of closed contours. As the
two different slices show, a separate contour is drawn in each section
where the feature appears. You can draw as many separate contours as
necessary to enclose the feature belonging to an object on one section.
After you have drawn
the model, you run a separate program, <a href="man/imodmesh.html">imodmesh</a>,
to connect the contours across the sections and create a surface that
can be viewed. Closed contours without point symbols are the default
when a
new object is created. The contour in section 16 does have some
circles drawn on it because it is the current contour. The first and
last points
of the current contour are highlighted with green and red circles,
while the current point has a yellow circle drawn on it. </li>
  <li>Open contours are used when the end of a contour should not be
connected
back to the starting point. There are two cases where this is
useful. If only part of an extended feature in present in the images,
you would draw an open contour in each section along the boundary of
the object. The yellow lines in the images are open contours showing
the
border of the darkly stained chromosome.
The other main use is to model trajectories in
3D, between sections. In the example images, open contours are used to
model microtubules through space, and the points are marked by green
circles.
Open contours are also used to track gold
fiducial particles through a tilt series. </li>
  <li>Scattered points are used when you do not want connecting lines
between
the successive
points of a contour. Such points are usually displayed as a sphere in a
3D view of the model, or as a circle in cross-sections such as in the
Zap window.
In the example, a small round vesicle has been modeled simply by
placing a
single scattered point on it on section 12 (magenta circle).
Depending
on the sphere radius selected, a scattered point will typically show up
on several sections,
with the circle becoming smaller away from the central section where
the point was placed (the circle is smaller on section 16). A
cross is drawn
inside the circle on the
central section to show that the point was deposited on that section;
if this does not make it clear enough you can also
make a separate symbol be displayed only on the central section. </li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="Object Edit">
<h4>The Object Edit Dialog</h4>
</a></h3>
<p><a name="Object Edit"></a>The type of contours in an object, and the
symbols displayed at
individual points, can be selected with the Object Edit dialog box.
Here are two examples.

On the left
is a box for the open contour object that is used to track microtubules
between sections. A circle is selected for the symbol display, and
the symbol size has been set to 7, so that it will be easy to see the
symbol when there is only one point on a particular section.&nbsp; On
the
right is a box for the scattered point object used to model small
vesicles;
here no symbol is
selected but the sphere radius for points has been set to 14.

See the
<a href="man/3dmod.html">3dmod</a> manual page section on mouse
controls for more details. </p>
<p>When you first start a new model or a new object in a model, your
first model point will be added to an empty contour. There are two
basic ways to add model points to a contour. You can click
the middle mouse button to add each individual point after moving to a
desired position. The other way is to hold
down the middle button while dragging the pointer over a desired
path, which will add closely spaced points along the path. </p>
<p>Once you have finished a contour and want to start another one, you
need to create a new contour. This can be done with the menu entry
Edit-Contour-New, but is much more conveniently done by pressing "n",
which is one of many hot keys available to assist modeling. If you
are modeling with closed contours, a new contour is created
automatically when you switch to a new section and press the middle
mouse button.&nbsp; When you are modeling with open contours, this does
not happen automatically unless you select the option to "Start new
contour at new Z" seen above in the Object Edit dialog box.&nbsp; This
option is not turned on for modeling
microtubules, but it is useful for drawing open contours that are
supposed to be confined to one section, such as the ones along the
chromosome boundary.
</p>
<p>As you model, the last point added is left as the current model
point. You can change the current model point by clicking with the
left mouse button near a point in any contour that is present on the
section. This is one way to change the contour or object being
modeled.
If you click with the left button at a position that is far
from any model points, the current point and contour become
undefined. If you then add a model point, it will be placed in a new
contour, so this is yet another way to begin a new contour.
</p>
<p>The right mouse button is used to modify existing points by either
moving or deleting them. Use this button alone to move one or more
points; hold down the Ctrl key to delete points under the cursor while
clicking or holding down the right button.
</p>
<h3><a name="Zap Toolbar">
<h4>The Zap Toolbar</h4>
</a></h3>
<p><a name="Zap Toolbar"></a></p>
<center> <img src="3dmodimages/zaptoolbar.png" alt="Zap window toolbar">
</center>
<p>The toolbar for the Zap window has a number of useful controls.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>In addition to the arrows for changing zoom to fixed zoom values,
there is a text box which both displays the current zoom value and
allows you
to enter any arbitrary zoom.
(Fractional zooms may be slower on some machines.)</li>
  <li>The numbers next to the zoom text box show the size of the
window, or of the area enclosed by the rubberband, in pixels in the
screen.&nbsp; This could be useful for taking a snapshot of an area of
a particular size.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The Checkerboard button will toggle between fast drawing and
slower, high-resolution drawing with pixel smoothing when the zoom is
greater than 1. </li>
  <li>The Lock button is used to keep the image from centering on the
current
point and to allow different Zap windows to display different
sections.
When the lock is closed, the image will not move when the current model
point changes, but it can be moved with the mouse or the PageUp and
PageDown
keys. When the lock is open, the image may automatically pan to the
current
point, depending on the setting of the Centering button. This panning
does
not happen when the current point is selected or added by a mouse
button. </li>
  <li>The Centering button toggles between two centering modes. In one
mode,
the image will be centered on the current point only if it falls near
the
edge of the window, that is, outside of a central box. (Thus, the icon
shows
one box inside another.) In the other mode, the
image will be recentered on the current point each time you change the
current point. (The icon shows a point inside the outer box.) </li>
  <li>The Insert, or Modeling Direction, button toggles between
inserting points before and inserting points after the current model
point.
This is useful when modeling a feature that passes between sections,
in case you need to add points to the start of a contour.</li>
  <li>The Rubberband button toggles the rubberband on and off.&nbsp;
The rubberband can be used for getting coordinates, resizing, and
setting contrast in selected areas.&nbsp; The rubberband is initially
positioned by pressing the left mouse button at the upper left corner
of the desired area and dragging to the lower right, and then can be
repositioned and resized with left and middle mouse buttons.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The Z slider allows you to riffle through the sections and select
a particular one. The text box shows the value of the current section
being viewed in the Zap window and allows you to go to a particular
section
by entering a number. </li>
  <li>The I button brings the Info Window to the top and prints
information there about the image size and location, as well as a
command that could be used to extract the image visible in the window
or inside the rubberband. </li>
  <li>Finally, there is a Help button to open a window with help for
all
features of the Zap window. All image windows and dialog boxes
have a Help button to provide window-specific information.&nbsp; The
help system consists of a set of html files that are
browseable.&nbsp; Here is the <a href="3dmodHelp/zap.html">help page</a>
for the Zap window, and here is an <a href="3dmodHelp/index.html">index</a>

<p>The XYZ Window shows not just the XY plane but also the two
orthogonal
planes, YZ and XZ, in separate view boxes. It allows you to movie
through the volume in any
of these planes independently, and also displays the intersection of
the model with each of the three planes. In the example, the XY plane
is in the lower left, the XZ plane is above it, and the YZ plane is to
the right.
The current image point governs which planes are
displayed; its position is marked by a small yellow cross in each
image panel. In the figure on the left, you can see the large modeled
vesicle in the XZ (top)
plane, and
an oblique slice through the microtubule marked by the small yellow
cross in the YZ (right) plane.<br>
</p>
<p>When the XYZ Window is first opened, the window size, the zoom, and
the division of the window among the three view boxes are set so that
the whole image will appear in each of the view boxes.&nbsp; You can
then resize the window if desired, and the program will maintain the
same proportion among the view boxes.&nbsp; If you make the window
smaller or zoom up, then not all of the image will appear, and you can
pan with the left mouse button in any one of the view boxes to bring
features of interest back into view.&nbsp; Panning in one plane will
typically shift the image in another plane so that all three planes
will always show the same feature.&nbsp; If you find that the top and
side view boxes are too narrow, which can easily be the case after
zooming up, then you can reapportion the window area among the three
boxes by dragging the light blue square diagonally with the left mouse
button.<br>
</p>
<p>The toolbar of the XYZ Window has zoom controls and a low/high
resolution button as in the Zap Window.&nbsp; There is a centering
button for bringing the current point as near to the center of the view
boxes as possible.&nbsp; In movie mode, it will center the current
image point marked by the yellow crosses; in model mode it will center
the current model point.&nbsp; The toolbar also has sliders for
riffling through the X, Y, or Z coordinate.<br>
</p>
<p>The colored marker lines in the margins of the images also
indicate the current point coordinates. They contain small handles
that can be grabbed with the mouse to riffle through the images in one
plane, as an alternative to the toolbar sliders. The color of the
marker line matches the color of the border
around the image
that is controlled by it; for example, the red line controls the plane
selected in the upper panel.
</p>
<p>The display of the model in the XY plane is essentially the same as
in
the Zap Window. In the other planes, scattered points will show up as
circles, and other segments of contours will appear to the extent that
they intersect the plane.
</p>
<p>In Movie mode, the mouse buttons behave the
same as in the Zap Window, and they act separately in the three image
panels
for selecting the current image point or starting a movie in that
panel.
Basic modeling can also be done in the XY plane, again with the same
mouse button
functions as in the Zap Window. </p>

<p>The Slicer Window provides a much more flexible view of structures
than the
XYZ Window because it can display a slice at an arbitrary orientation
through the image volume. The orientation is set by adjusting the X,
Y, and Z rotation sliders in the second toolbar. In the example, one
of the oblique microtubules was centered in the window, then the
Z rotation was adjusted to orient the microtubule vertically,
then the X rotation was adjusted to bring the microtubule into
longitudinal section. Small changes in the X and Y sliders usually
cause big
changes in the image appearance, whereas the Z slider will primarily
rotate the
image clockwise and counterclockwise unless X or Y angles are large.
</p>
<p>When a Slicer is opened, the center of the displayed slice is
initially at the current
image point, but it can then be panned in the plane of the slice using
the left mouse button, just as for other windows.&nbsp; You can step
through slices in the direction perpendicular to the displayed slice
using the PageUp and PageDown hot keys.&nbsp; The center of the window
is marked by a red cross; this is the center of rotation when the slice
angles are changed.<br>
</p>
<p>There is an alternative method of changing the slice angles which
can often be more convenient and intuitive than adjusting the
sliders.&nbsp; When you hold down the Shift key and the middle mouse
button, you can rotate the volume around an axis perpendicular to the
direction of mouse motion.&nbsp; For example, the image on the right
shows the result of dragging with the middle mouse button in the
direction of the red arrow until some of the microtubules come into
good cross-section.&nbsp; You can also rotate in the plane of the slice
by holding down the Shift key and dragging with the right mouse&nbsp;
button.&nbsp; The Shift key also converts the numeric keypad hot keys
from operating on an individual axis angle to rotating the volume
around X, Y or Z axes relative to the current slice; in the latter
case, these keys operate the same as for the model view window shown
below.<br>
</p>
<p>The most useful items in the sSicer toolbars are the following.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The arrow buttons can be used to change zoom, and the text box
displays the current zoom and allows a custom zoom to be entered. </li>
  <li>The checkerboard allows you to toggle between rapid,
low-resolution drawing using nearest-neighbor interpolation, and
high resolution drawing using quadratic and cubic
interpolation. The latter may be considerably slower, but it will
also be more accurate as well as giving a smoother image. </li>
  <li>The lock button will prevent the slice position from being moved.
There are two main uses for this feature. First, it allows you to
maintain a selected view in a Slicer Window while changing to other
views in other windows (including other Slicers). Second, it prevents
the slow drawing in the slicer from slowing down
the program when you want to work in or movie through other windows.</li>
  <li>The centering mode button can be used to toggle back to an older
mode of operation, where the Slicer was always centered on the current
image point and could not be panned.&nbsp; This is perhaps most useful
for recentering on the current image or model point, by pushing the
button on then off.</li>
  <li>The Sh button turns on a Shift Lock mode, in which the mouse and
keypad can be used to rotate the model as described above without
having to hold down the Shift key.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The IM/FT button toggles between showing an image and a Fourier
transform of the image.</li>
  <li>The C button shows the slice in which the current contour will
appear flat.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The box to the right of the sliders portrays the portion of the
slice being viewed as a red plane inside of a representation of the
whole image volume. </li>
  <li>The Help button describes hot keys and other features. </li>
  <li>The image thickness spin box lets you display a slice thicker
than 1 pixel thick. The Slicer computes a projection through the
number of slices that you select, effectively averaging those slices. </li>
  <li>The model thickness spin box lets you control the thickness of
the
slice of model that is displayed on the image. In the example, the
circles at each microtubule point are considered to lie in the XY
plane and sometimes only a fragment intersects the tilted slice.
Increasing the model thickness would make the whole circle show up. </li>
</ul>
<p>If the Ctrl key is held down, the middle and right mouse buttons
will start a movie in the Slicer
window, as in the Zap window.&nbsp; The program will movie through
slices in a direction prependicular to the current slice, and will even
adjust its direction if you change the rotation sliders while it is
movieing.<br>
</p>
<p>It is possible to model in the Slicer, again with the same mouse
button functions as in the Zap window. This provides a convenient way
to track trajectories in 3D.&nbsp; Points
can be drawn continuously by moving the mouse while holding the second
mouse button down.&nbsp; The PageUp and PageDown keys will move
the center point by one pixel perpendicular to the plane being viewed,
which allows you to draw evenly spaced
contours at oblique angles.&nbsp; See the Slicer <a
 href="3dmodHelp/slicer.html">help page</a>
for the more details. <br>
</p>
<p>The power of the Slicer comes at a cost - it is the first window
that we have seen where the computation time can easily make the
display unacceptably slow. Display time depends on four factors:
image thickness, high versus low resolution, image size, and the number
of processors available. The program will take advantage of up to 4
processors automatically.&nbsp; If you
need to average through many slices with a high resolution display, be
sure to make the image as small as possible. If you must work with a
very slow slicer window, remember that the hot sliders can be tamed
with the Ctrl key.
</p>
<p><a name="Setting Z-scale"> <dd>
  <h3>Setting Z-scale and Pixel Size</h3>
</dd>
</a>In order for your model to look right in 3D, you may need to set a
property
called the "Z-scale" correctly. Both the Z-scale and the pixel size
must be set to get accurate quantitative information about the model,
because these values are used for calculating length, surface area
or volume from object, contour or mesh data.
To adjust these fields in the model header
select the Model Header menu item from the Edit menu in the
3dmod <a href="#Information%20Window">Information Window</a>.
</p>
<p>The Z-Scale is the ratio of the thickness between successive images
to the pixel size. Its two most common uses are to adjust for
section thickness in serial section reconstructions and section
thinning
in tomography. For serial sections, divide the section thickness in
nanometers by the pixel size at which the data were digitized, again
in nanometers. For tomograms, divide the original thickness at which
the section was cut on the microtome (in nanometers) by the actual
thickness of
material in the tomogram (pixels of material times pixel size in
nanometers).&nbsp; In either case, if you have an estimate of how much
the specimen shrank laterally due to beam exposure, you should multiply
by the shrinkage factor (e.g., 0.9 for 10% shrinkage).<br>
</p>
<p>The Pixel Size field should contain both a value for the size of the
pixel in the digitized data, and the units for that value.
Units can be one of the following; A, nm, um, mm, m, km. For example,
you could enter "0.015 um" or "15 nm".

<p>These are different views of the example model in the Model View
Window, which can be opened while running 3dmod by selecting Model
View from the Image menu, or by typing the hot key "v".
This same window can be opened in
a standalone mode with
<br>
<code> 3dmodv example.mod</code>
<br>
The model has been
tilted around the X and Y axes using the arrow keys on the keypad.
The model can also be rotated with the middle mouse button, or using
arrows and text boxes in the
Control dialog box that can be opened using the Edit-Controls menu
entry, but the arrow keys are often more convenient. A single keystrike
rotates the model by one step. Continuous rotation is started by
pressing the keypad Enter key followed by the desired arrow key;
another press of the Enter key stops the rotation.
</p>
<p>On the left is the initial view of the model, before any of the
default viewing parameters have been changed. These parameters are
initially set to show open and closed contour objects with contour line
tracings, and scattered points as wire baskets. The middle view shows
two changes that can be made immediately, without having to compute
surface meshes for the contours. The microtubule lines (green) have
been made
thicker and the scattered points are displayed as lighted surfaces.
On the right is the display after making meshes for the objects (as
explained below) and setting all objects to display as lighted
surfaces. These display settings are all changed in the 3dmodv
Objects dialog box, opened with the Edit-Objects menu item or the O hot
key. </p>

<p>The Objects dialog box contains controls for selecting the current
object to be edited, buttons for turning individual objects on or off,
and a set of panels for setting different object properties or
controlling the overall display. A panel is selected by clicking on
its name in the list.
</p>
<p>The example on the left shows how the appearance of the green lines
was changed for the middle model view panel above. The "Lines" panel
was selected, the 3D line width was increased from 1 to 3, and
"Anti-alias rendering" was turned on to smooth out the jagged edges of
the lines.
</p>
<p>The example in the middle shows how the scattered points were
displayed as solid objects. The selection for "Draw Data Type" was
changed from "Contour" to "Mesh". 3dmod automatically changed "Drawing
Style" from "Line" to "Fill" to produce the most commonly desired
appearance.
</p>
<p>The example on the right shows a change that was required after
meshes
were computed and displayed for all
objects. By default, objects are lit only on one surface, which is
always the outer
surface for closed contour objects. (Note the dark surfaces on the
interior of the microtubules.) However, a sheet like the chromosome
boundary (yellow) does not have an obvious interior surface, and its
lit surface happened to face downward, toward the chromosome. This
problem was solved by checking the "Light Both Sides" option in the
"Material" panel. The other method of solving this is to go back to
the 3dmod Object Edit dialog box and change the "Front Face" from
"Outside" to "Inside", then recompute the mesh.
</p>
<p>The appearance of the magenta scattered point was improved between
the middle
and right views of the model by pressing the "g" hot key twice to
increase sphere drawing quality. When there are many spheres, this
degree of quality could
significantly increase drawing time for the display, so it is not the
default.
The sphere drawing quality can also be controlled in the "Points"
panel, which allows one to change the global quality setting (just as
with the "g" and "G" hot keys) as well as set a quality for individual
objects.<br>
</p>
<p>When the Model View window is opened from 3dmod, it is possible to
display the image data together with the model in this window.&nbsp;
Use the Edit-Image menu entry to open a dialog to control many aspects
of the image

<p><a name="Skinning Model"> <dd>
  <h3>Putting a Skin on Model Data</h3>
</dd>
</a>Skinning is the name used for calculating a three-dimensional
surface from contour data. This surface, once calculated, is
represented by
a mesh of triangles that can be stored within each object.
If any contour points within that object are edited then the mesh
for that object must be recalculated in order for it to match
the contour data.
There are two ways to calculate the mesh from the contour data within a
model: with the <a href="man/imodmesh.html">imodmesh</a> program, and
with the Meshing panel of the Objects dialog box.&nbsp; Using imodmesh
allows many objects to be meshed at once and provides a wide range of
options for controlling the meshing; whereas the Meshing panel provides
a more intuitive interface with the most important options.<br>
</p>
<p>To skin the example model, this command was used:
<br>
<code>imodmesh -C -t 1 -d 10 example.mod</code>
</p>
<p>By default, imodmesh will construct meshes only between pairs of
contours, which will leave holes at the top and the bottom of a closed
contour object because
there is nothing to connect the highest and lowest contours to.
The "-C" option tells imodmesh to fill in these holes
or "Cap" them off.
</p>
<p>In the model view on the right, the lines of the microtubules appear
as tubes because imodmesh created cylindical meshes around them. It
did this because of the
"-t" option, which is followed by a list of open contour object numbers
that should be given tubular meshes
(here, just object 1). The "-d" option is then used to specify the
diameter of the tubes, in pixels (10).<br>
</p>
Sometimes the mesh data structure can get so large that interactive
viewing is very slow. There are two ways to make a mesh with a lower
resolution, the "-R" option to skip points within contours and
the "-i" option to skip Z levels. With "-R", imodmesh will skip
points that are within a certain distance of the line segments between
the remaining points, thus preserving the shape of
curves. For example,
<br>
<p><code>imodmesh -C -o 4 -R 0.75 -i 2 example.mod</code>
<br>
Here, a new mesh is created only for object 4 (-o 4), and
points will
be skipped, but the surface defined by the mesh will always be within
0.75
pixel of the original data (-R 0.75). In addition, the "-i 2" makes
imodmesh connect every other Z plane (i.e., at intervals of 2 in Z),
reducing the mesh size by 2.
</p>
<p>Each time you run imodmesh, the existing file is saved as a backup
file
with a "~" added to its name. You can also erase all of the mesh data
from your model using the "-e" option to imodmesh.
</p>
<p>Imodmesh also has an option (-l) to store a low resolution mesh
alongside a
regular mesh, so that a big model can be manipulated rapidly in
low-resolution mode then switched to high-resolution mode for studying
details.
Other commonly needed options are -s and -P to connect contours across
gaps; see the <a href="man/imodmesh.html">imodmesh</a> man page for
details.<br>
</p>
<p>All the options just mentioned are presented in the interface in the
Meshing panel:<br>
</p>
<table style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: left;"
 border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;"><img

 alt="Meshing panel for tube object"
 src="3dmodimages/objedmtmeshing.png"><br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Whenever an object is meshed, either with imodmesh or through this
interface, the options used to mesh the object are stored in the model,
and their values will be displayed when this panel is opened.&nbsp;
This makes it easy to remesh objects without having to remember exactly
what options were used previously.&nbsp; On the left, the "Tol" and "Z
inc" settings reflects the values entered with the -R and -i options to
imodmesh, and the "Cap" checkbox indicates that the -C option was used
for the vesicle object.&nbsp; On the right, the "Tube" selection and
the
diameter are shown for the microtubule object.&nbsp; When the "Make
Mesh" button is pressed, the meshing process is started in a separate
thread so that you can continue working in 3dmod while the mesh is
being computed.<br>
</p>
<p>If you do mesh with imodmesh while you are modeling in 3dmod,
be sure to save the model, run imodmesh, then immediately load the
model back into 3dmod with the Reload Model entry in the File
menu.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="Making_Movies"></a>Making Movies</h3>
<p>Because IMOD does not produce files that can be used in movie
players, if you want to make a movie of your images or models, you need
to make a series
of snapshots of a window and import those images into movie-making
software.&nbsp; There are two dialogs that help manage this task:<br>
</p>
<table style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: left;"
 border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;"><img

      <td style="vertical-align: top;"><img
 alt="Movie dialog for models" src="3dmodimages/modelmovies.png"><br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>On the left is the dialog box opened with Edit-Movies from the 3dmod
Info Window menu and used to control movieing and automatic
snapshots in image display windows (primarily Zap and Slicer).&nbsp;
The sliders at the top allow you select the range and increment between
slices to be snapshot.&nbsp; Here, every slice from 6 to 56 will be
snapshot.&nbsp; The<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Looping</span>
radio buttons control how many pictures will be taken when you start a
movie.&nbsp; With <span style="font-weight: bold;">Round trip</span>
selected, pictures will be taken going in both directions, which is
useful if your movie playing software will not loop back and
forth.&nbsp; If your movie software will loop back and forth, you can
select <span style="font-weight: bold;">One way</span> and get
pictures going in just one direction.&nbsp; The <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Start at </span>radio buttons allow you to
choose whether the set of pictures will start and end at the limits in
Z (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Start/end</span>) or at the
currently display section (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Current pt</span>).&nbsp;
To get a series of pictures, select one of the file formats in the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Snapshot</span> box and start a movie in a
Zap or Slicer window with the middle or right mouse button.&nbsp; The
window will stop movieing when the set of pictures is finished.<br>
</p>
<p>On the right is the corresponding dialog for movies, opened with
File-Movies from the Model View Window menu.&nbsp; In the most general
case, you can adjust the
model display to the desired starting position, orientation, and size,
and press <span style="font-weight: bold;">Set Start</span>; then
adjust the display to the desired final state and press <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Set End</span>.&nbsp; Often one simply
wants the model to spin all the way around, which is provided by the
buttons <span style="font-weight: bold;">Full 360 X</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Full 360 Y</span>.&nbsp; When you press <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Make,</span> you will see the model go
through its sequence of positions.&nbsp; If it is doing the right
thing, select a file format and check <span style="font-weight: bold;">Write
files</span>, then press <span style="font-weight: bold;">Make</span>
again.<br>
</p>
<p>The different image formats differ in their degree and type of
compression.&nbsp; TIFF files are uncompressed and can be quite large,
since they are 24-bit color.&nbsp; PNG files have a loss-less
compression that is quite effective for most model snapshots but much
less effective for image snapshots.&nbsp; JPEG files will give the most
compression, with some loss of information that can be controlled by
the percent quality factor, selectable in the 3dmod <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Preferences</span> dialog.&nbsp; For images
with no model overlay, 80% quality is usually adequate for making
movies.&nbsp; If there is a model overlay, you need 90% or higher
quality to make it look decent in the individual snapshots (images here
were shot at 90% quality).&nbsp; It might be preferable to take such
snapshots as PNG's and let your movie software take care of the
compression.<br>
</p>
<p>Note that both of these dialogs have a montage option for capturing
high-resolution snapshots that are larger than the image window
itself.&nbsp; In each case, the program zooms up the display and pans
around to capture a montage of images, then assembles these into a
single image and writes a TIFF file.&nbsp; A movie of such montaged
snapshots can be saved from the Zap window, but only a single frame can
be saved in high-resolution mode from the model view window.<br>

</center>
<ul>
  <li><b>Surfaces.</b> Surfaces are an optional level of organization
between
objects and contours. They are particularly useful when you want to
keep track of many components of one kind, without making a
separate object for each. Quantitative information can then be
derived for each different surface. The top section of this dialog
box has some controls for creating and navigating through surfaces,
and its help window has more information about them. </li>
  <li><b>Open and closed contours.</b> Some of the contours in a closed
contour object can be defined as open, which means that their starting
and
ending points
will not be connected. This is useful when modeling a feature that is
partially or completely cut by the boundary of a data set.
See the <a href="man/imodmesh.html">imodmesh</a> man page as well as
the help window for this dialog box for details. </li>
  <li><b>4D modeling.</b> 3dmod can load multiple image files, which
occupy a
fourth dimension referred to as "time". Thus, contours in an object can
be at different times. </li>
  <li><b>Point sizes.</b> Not all points in a scattered point object
need to
be the same size; individual points can be given different sizes using
the controls in the Point section of this dialog box. There is even a
way to draw a closed contour around a feature and have it converted to
a scattered point with the equivalent radius (see the dialog box
accessed
from the Edit-Contour-Move menu entry). </li>
  <li><b>Ghost displays.</b> You can project a "ghost" of contours on
adjacent
sections onto the current section to help you see where to draw the
next contour.</li>
  <li><b>Fine grained display properties.</b>&nbsp;
You can control several display properties of points within contours,
individual contours, or surfaces using the Fine Grain Control dialog,
shown above in the middle. In this example, the window shows the
properties of the current point, and all of the properties marked with
an "S" instead of a "D" have been set differently for this point than
for the rest of the contour.&nbsp; In addition to allowing manipulation
of color, line thickness, symbol displays, and transparency, the dialog
allows multiple openings to be defined in contours, as shown in the
model on the right.&nbsp; For more details see the <a
 href="3dmodHelp/finegrain.html">help page</a>.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Preferences.</b> You can set preferences that are stored
between
sessions
of 3dmod, such as the assignment of
the three mouse buttons and the type of file that will be snapshot with
Shift-S. Use the Edit-Options menu entry to open the
3dmod Preferences dialog box.&nbsp; (This item is under the Apple menu
on the Mac.)<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Automated modeling.</b> There are two facilities for automated
modeling.
The Auto Contouring dialog box, opened from the Edit-Contour menu,
will draw contours around areas that are above or below a selected
threshold of intensity. The Line Track plugin, opened from the Special
menu, will draw
contours along a linear feature such as a membrane, either by filling
in points
between two points placed along the feature, or by copying a contour
from one section to the next and adjusting its position to fit changes
in the boundary or the object. </li>
  <li><b>Pixel View window.</b> Use the Image-Pixel View menu entry to
open a
window
that displays a grid of pixel intensity values as well as a continuous
display of the mouse position in the image and the pixel value at that
location. The actual values
from the image file are shown in the grid; the continuous display can
show either the byte values from within 3dmod or the values in the
file. </li>
  <li><b>Graph Window.</b> Use the Image-Graph menu entry to open a
window
that can display a graph of pixel values along a line or along a
contour; here is the <a href="3dmodHelp/graph.html">help page</a>.&nbsp;
It is possible to define a line width so as to average over several
pixels, and to see the average value over a subset of a line selected
with the Zap window rubberband.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Locator Window.</span> Use the
Image-Locator menu entry to open a window that displays a zoomed-down
image of the whole image area, with a red box outlining the area
displayed in the active Zap window.&nbsp; You can even click a new
center position, or drag the box, to pan the Zap window to the selected
location.&nbsp; Here is the <a href="3dmodHelp/locator.html">help page</a>.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Tumbler Window.</b> Use the Image-Tumbler menu entry to open a
window
that will show a projection through a small volume of data as the
volume is tilted to different orientations; here is the <a
 href="3dmodHelp/tumbler.html">help page</a>. </li>
  <li><b>Storing Slicer Angles.</b> Use the Edit-Angles menu entry to
open a dialog that allows you save views seen in a Slicer Window.&nbsp;
Each view consists of the 3 slicer angles and the center
position.&nbsp; You can then set a Slicer to one of these stored views,
and go between different views easily.&nbsp; If multiple image files
are loaded into 3dmod, different views can be saved for each.&nbsp;
This feature could be used to align and toggle between different copies
of a similar structure.&nbsp; Here is the <a
 href="3dmodHelp/slicerAngles.html">help page</a>.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Synchronizing Model View and
Slicer Windows.</span>&nbsp; It is possible to synchronize the angles
of the Model View Window and a Slicer Window so that changing the view
angles in one will rotate the other as well.&nbsp; Use Edit-Controls in
the Model View menu to open the Controls dialog, and select the
checkbox <span style="font-weight: bold;">Link to top Slicer angles</span>.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Object color.</b> You can change an object's color using the
Edit-Object-Color menu entry from the 3dmod Info Window, as well as
using the Edit-Objects dialog box from the Model View Window.</li>
  <li><b>Saving views.</b>&nbsp; The Edit-Views entry in the menu of
the Model View Window opens a dialog that allows you to save distinct
views of the model, which can differ in many features such as
orientation, the selection of objects displayed, and object properties
such as color and lighting characteristics.&nbsp; Once you have saved
the views you can switch between them easily.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Editing contours.</b> The Edit-Contour menu has a number of
advanced
editing features, including ones to move or copy contours from one
object to another, and ones to break and
join contours (see the help for <a href="3dmodHelp/contourMove.html">contour
moving</a> and <a href="3dmodHelp/contourJoin.html">contour joining</a>).</li>
  <li><b>Multiple selected contours.</b>&nbsp; It is possible to select
more
than one contour;
this is useful for several operations such as deleting, moving, or
joining contours.&nbsp; Multiple selection is done with the Ctrl key
(Apple on the Macintosh), such as Ctrl and first mouse button to add a
contour to the set of selected ones, and Ctrl-A to select all contours
on a section in the current object.</li>
  <li><b>Image processing dialog.</b>&nbsp;
The Edit-Image-Process menu entry opens a dialog box that allows you to
process one section of the image.&nbsp; You can take an FFT or apply a
number of filters such as Fourier filtering, smoothing, and median
filtering; here is the <a href="3dmodHelp/imageProc.html">help page</a>.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Tooltips.</b> If you leave the mouse over a button or other
control
for over half a second, a tooltip will appear for that control. </li>
