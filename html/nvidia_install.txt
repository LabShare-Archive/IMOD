These instructions for installing an Nvidia card to use with IMOD may
be helpful.  They were correct as of January 2006.  The list of steps
assume that you have already installed Linux with xorg-X11 and its associated
drivers.

1. Go to the Nvidia web site (http://www.nvidia.com) and find the page
offering Linux drivers (e.g. select Download Drivers - Linux, FreeBSD and
Solaris Drivers - Linux IA32 or Linux AMD64/EM64T, Latest Version or Archive
for older versions).  Download the driver installer file, e.g.
NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-8178-pkg1.run.  Notice links to the README file, which
you may need to consult.  After you have installed the drivers, this file is
in /usr/share/doc/NVIDIA_GLX-1.0.
 
2. Switch the screen to console mode (Ctrl-Alt-F1) and log in, or ssh from
another machine.  Bring the machine to runlevel 3 with:
   init 3

3. Go to the location where you have placed your Nvidia install file and
run it as recommended in the instructions, e.g.
 sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-8178-pkg1.run

4. Edit your /etc/X11/xorg.conf.
Make sure the modules section loads "glx".
Make your driver line says "Driver nvidia".
A sample xorg.conf file is available for your reference.

5. Type startx and see what happens. Success is indicated by a Gnome or KDE
desktop.  Failure is a message saying the X server cannot come up.  A
frequent message is a complaint about no/missing screens.  This really
means that the nvidia driver could not start for one reason or another.
You can examine the start up process in detail by looking in the file
/var/log/XFree86.0.log.  Make sure that the number of bits specified in
the Display line matches up with one of the screens that is declared.

6. Log out of the session started with startx.  Return to runlevel 5 with
  init 5

7. Log in as a normal user.  Assuming IMOD is installed normally, run 3dmodv
on the file yeastpore.mod:

   3dmodv yeastpore.mod

Start the model spinning by typing Enter and 8 on the numeric keypad.
After 5 seconds or more, type o to get an output of frames/second.
You should probably get at least 200 FPS (assuming you have at least a
GeForce4 with at least a 1.7 GHz processor).  If it is a lot slower
than this, the Nvidia drivers and GL libraries may not be installed
correctly.  If the rate is somewhat slower (e.g. below 100), you may
have problems with the AGP support.  Do
   cat  /proc/driver/nvidia/agp/status
 and see if AGP is Disabled.

8. Note that you need to reinstall the Nvidia drivers whenever either the
kernel or X is updated to a new version.  Just follow steps 2, 3 and 6.
