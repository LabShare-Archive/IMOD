These instructions for installing an Nvidia card to use with IMOD may
be helpful.  They were correct as of May 2003.  The list of steps
assume that you have already installed Red Hat Linux with the XFree86
4.0 drivers.

1. Go to the Nvidia web site (http://www.nvidia.com) and find the page
offering Linux drivers (e.g. select Download Drivers, Linux and
FreeBSD Drivers, Linux IA32 Latest Version).  Download the driver
installer file, e.g. NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-4363.run.  Notice links to
the README file, which you may need to consult.  After you have
installed the drivers, this file is in /usr/share/doc/NVIDIA_GLX-1.0.
 
2. Make sure the default boot is into the terminal mode instead of x.
This is done by setting the run mode as indicated below in /etc/inittab:

id:3:initdefault

(Note:  the values for this will be specified in comments in the file.)

Reboot if necessary for this to take effect.

3. Go to the location where you have placed your Nvidia install file and
run it as recommended in the instructions, e.g.
 sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-4363.run

4. Edit your /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 file if it exists, otherwise 
/etc/X11/XF86Config.
Make sure the modules section loads "glx".
Make your driver line says "Driver nvidia".
A sample XF86Config file is attached for your reference.

5. Type startx and see what happens. Success is indicated by a Gnome or KDE
desktop.  Failure is a message saying the X server cannot come up.  A
frequent message is a complaint about no/missing screens.  This really
means that the nvidia driver could not start for one reason or another.
You can examine the start up process in detail by looking in the file
/var/log/XFree86.0.log.  Make sure that the number of bits specified in
the Display line matches up with one of the screens that is declared.

6. Modify /etc/inittab to set the run mode to graphical and boot into X
by default, if desired.

7. Log in as a normal user.  If IMOD is not fully installed yet, set up to run
IMOD programs by going to the top IMOD directory and entering

   export IMOD_DIR=`pwd`
   source IMOD-linux.sh

if you are running bash, or

   setenv IMOD_DIR `pwd`
   source IMOD-linux.csh

if you are running tcsh.  Run 3dmodv on the file yeastpore.mod:

   3dmodv yeastpore.mod

 Start the model spinning by typing Enter and 8 on the numeric keypad.
After 5 seconds or more, type o to get an output of frames/second.
You should probably get at least 120 FPS (assuming you have at least a
GeForce2 with at least an 800 MHz processor).  If it is a lot slower
than this, the Nvidia drivers and GL libraries may not be installed
correctly.  If the rate is somewhat slower (e.g. below 100), you may
have problems with the AGP support.  Do
   cat  /proc/driver/nvidia/agp/status
 and see if AGP is Disabled.
