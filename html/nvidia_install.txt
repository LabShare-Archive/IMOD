These instructions may be helpful with the steps required if you are
installing an Nvidia card to use with IMOD.  They were correct as of
November 2001.  The list of steps assume that you have already installed
Red Hat Linux 7.1 with the XFree86 4.0.x drivers.

1. Go to the Nvidia web site (http://www.nvidia.com) and find the page
offering Linux drivers (e.g. select Support Center, Drivers, Back to
Driver Library).  Select the latest version for XFree86 4.0.x and by
either ftp or http download, get two tar.gz files:
   NVIDIA_kernel-1.0-1541.tar.gz
   NVIDIA_GLX-1.0-1541.tar.gz

Notice links to the README and Installation Guide on this site; you will need
to access this if you run into trouble or are deviating from our narrow path
below.
 
2. In order to build the drivers, you must have the source for your current
kernel installed; the kernel headers will not do.  To check on this, start
GnoRPM (Paw-Programs-System-GnoRPM) and look under Development, System.  If
the source is not installed, insert your Redhat Source CD, press the Install
button in the Gnome RPM window, find the source for your current kernel under
Development, System, and install it.

3. Make sure the default boot is into the terminal mode instead of x.
This is done by setting the run mode as indicated below in /etc/inittab:

id:3:initdefault

(Note:  the values for this will be specified in comments in the file.)

Reboot if necessary for this to take effect.

4. Go to the location where you have placed your Nvidia tar files.
Untar the files using:

tar xvzf  xxxxxxxx.tar.gz

for both the kernel and glx tar files.

5. Go to the directory which contains the unpacked/untarred Nvidia kernel
files.  Type make.  This will build the interface files from your version of
Linux to the 1.0-1541 version of the Nvidia drivers.  Do a /sbin/lsmod to
double check - you will see a new entry for NVdriver.

6. Go to the directory in which the Nvidia GLX file was unpacked/untarred.
Type "make".  The message which comes out should indicate success. This will
install the 1.0-1541 version of OpenGL from Nvidia.

7. Edit your /etc/X11/XF86Config file.
Make sure the modules section loads "glx".
Make your driver line says "Driver nvidia".
A sample XF86Config file is attached for your reference.

8. Type startx and see what happens. Success is indicated by a Gnome
desktop.  Failure is a message saying the X server cannot come up.  A
frequent message is a complaint about no/missing screens.  This really
means that the nvidia driver could not start for one reason or another.
You can examine the start up process in details by looking in the file
/var/log/XFree86.0.log.  Make sure that the number of bits specified in
the Display line matches up with one of the screens that is declared.

9. Install the real OpenMotif libraries.  From the Gnome worksurface
(as root), insert the RH7 PowerTools Applications CD and start up
GNORPM.  (It should offer to start up automatically; if not, do
Paw-Programs-System-GnoRPM.)

Click the "install" icon on GNORPM to get the second window that
indicates packages available on the CD.

Under system environment, libraries, select "OpenMotif".

If you are building IMOD from source, then under development, libraries,
select "OpenMotif".

Do a query, make sure one or both are still selected as desired, then
"install" both.

After the install, go back to the first window and examine the installed
configuration to verify that they are now in place.

10. If you are building IMOD from source, then you need to install the
elusive GLw library and headers.  In the directory where you have
unpacked IMOD source, do
  make glw
  make installglw     (this step requires that you be root)

11. You are strongly encouraged to replace the Mesa libGLU.so with a version
built from SGI's source code.  This is essential if you are building IMOD
from source.  Mesa 3.5 apparently has such a libGLU, but the version of
Mesa distributed in Redhat 7.1 has a different libGLU that is broken in
some respects.  The Mesa site (http://www.mesa3d.org) has a link under
"SGI's GLU" to an rpm built by Olivier Michel.  Download this and
install with
   rpm -i  --replacefiles oss-opengl-glu-20000925-1.i386.rpm

12. Modify /etc/inittab to set the run mode to graphical and boot into X
by default, if desired.

13. Log in as a normal user.  Set up to run IMOD programs (e.g., source the
file "pcinstall" or "bashinstall" while sitting in the top IMOD directory).
Run imodv on the file yeastpore.mod
   imodv yeastpore.mod
 Start the model spinning by typing 5 and 8 on the numeric keypad.  After
5 seconds or more, type o to get an output of frames/second.  You should
probably get at least 150 FPS (assuming you have at least a GeForce2 with at
least an 800 MHz processor).  If it is a lot slower than this, the Nvidia
drivers and GL libraries may not be installed correctly.  Make very sure that
any conflicting Mesa libraries are eliminated. More information on this
subject may be found at the Nvidia driver site as well as at
www.tomshardware.com.  If the rate is somewhat slower (e.g. around 100), you
may have problems with the AGP support.  Do 
   cat /proc/nv/card0
 and see if AGP is Disabled.  If so, you may need to upgrade your kernel,
because the Redhat 7.1 distribution included a module that broke AGP support
for some processor/motherboard types.
