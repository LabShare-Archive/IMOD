                      JOINING TOMOGRAMS FROM SERIAL SECTIONS

     Joining tomograms from serial sections into one involves a sequence of
steps:
     1) flipping or rotating the volume so that slices in Z are parallel to the
plane of section;
     2) matching densities between the tomograms;
     3) extracting sample slices from the section boundaries so that these
boundaries can be visualized and aligned;
     4) getting transformations to align the top of each section to the bottom
of the next;
     5) assembling the joined volume.

Steps 1 to 3 can be accomplished by a command file, startjoin.com, that is
produced by the program Makejoincom.  The latter is an interactive shell
script that runs similarly to Copytomocoms.  For step 4, you use Midas.  Step
5 is done with the program Finishjoin, which is run with a single command-line
entry.  This makes it easy to rerun the joining with more or fewer 
slices included from the individual sections.

Preliminaries to Ponder
     If you have N tomograms, then there are N-1 boundaries between sections.
The words &quot;top&quot; and &quot;bottom&quot; are used here with a particular meaning: the
&quot;top&quot; of a section is the part of the tomogram that matches up with the
&quot;bottom&quot; of the next section.  These words do not refer to the high Z and low
Z portions of a tomogram, so the top of a section may be at either the high or
the low Z end.  The programs will take care of any inversions in Z, both in
extracting sample slices and in assembling the final volume, so you do not
need to worry about entering slice numbers in a particular order.

     You will probably want to create a new directory for your joining
operation so that it is easy to clean up afterwards.  You do not need to copy
the tomograms into this directory, however.  Makejoincom provides a lot of
flexibility in where the individual tomograms are located and in how some of
the files are named.  It does this by means of default directories and file
name extensions which you can override when you enter the name for a
particular file.  It asks you to enter a default directory for the individual
tomograms; if you enter nothing, the default will be the current directory.
You can enter names such as &quot;../tomos&quot; if the files are in a subdirectory
&quot;tomos&quot; parallel to your current one, or just &quot;..&quot; if the files are in the
directory above the one where you are joining.  When you enter the name of an
individual tomogram, you can override this default by putting a directory name
in front of the file name.  For example, you could enter &quot;../oddball/sec3&quot; if
the tomogram &quot;sec3.rec&quot; is in the directory &quot;../oddball&quot; while the rest are in
&quot;../tomos&quot;.
     Here is what to do in three cases which are probably the most common:
     1) If all of the tomograms are in the current directory, simply do not
enter a default directory, and enter each individual file name without
directory.
     2) If all of the tomograms are in some other directory, enter a path to
that directory as the default directory, and enter each individual file name
without directory.
     3) If each of the tomograms is in a different directory, do not enter a
default directory.  Enter the directory path in front of each of the
individual file names.

     The program will assume the extensions &quot;.rec&quot; for unflipped tomograms and
&quot;.flip&quot; for flipped or rotated ones.  You can enter different default
extensions for either of these types of files.  For example, enter &quot;byt&quot; if
your tomograms have the extension &quot;.byt&quot;, or &quot;.rot&quot; if you want that to be the
default extension for flipped or rotated volumes.  In any case, you can
override the default for an existing, individual volume by entering the name
with extension.  For example, suppose you already have a serial-section
tomogram named &quot;big.rec&quot; (which is already flipped) and you are adding another
section to it which is not yet flipped.  Then you would enter the name
&quot;big.rec&quot; instead of &quot;big&quot; to keep the program from looking for &quot;big.flip&quot;.

     You will be asked to enter a &quot;root name&quot; for the joined tomogram.  The
final tomogram will be named with this root name plus the extension &quot;.join&quot;.
An addition, a host of intermediate files will be created with this root name
and other extensions.

Flipping versus Rotating
     You need to decide whether flipping the tomograms is sufficient, or
whether some should be rotated with Rotatevol instead.  There are two reasons
to use Rotatevol.  1) If a tomogram is rotated by a large angle (e.g. 90
degree) relative to an adjacent section, then it might be easier to align the
slices across the boundary if this rotation is already corrected.  2) If the
surface of one section is pitched and can be made flat by a small rotation,
then the boundary between sections can be made smaller by correcting this
pitch.
     If you do want to use Rotatevol, then load the section into Imod
unflipped (use Edit-Image-Flip to unflip it if you have already loaded it
flipped).  Open a Slicer window and adjust the angles to achieve the desired
rotation.  One or more of the angles will need to be set near +90 or -90.  In
the simple case of correcting a pitch, this will be the first angle, for
rotation around the X axis.  If you need to rotate by 90 degrees in the plane
of the section, then the first angle will be near zero and both the second and
the third angles need to be near +90 or -90 (e.g., -90 around Y, 90 around Z).
It may take only a few tenths of a degree to correct significant pitch in the
section.  Use the numeric keypad arrow keys to adjust an angle by small
increments (4 and 6 for 0.1 degree increments, 2 and 8 for 0.5 degree
increments).  Once you have obtained the desired rotation, record the three
angles so that they can be entered into Makejoincom.
     
Deciding on Slices to Extract
     Finally, you need to decide which slices to extract from the top and
bottom of each section in order to construct a file that contains a sample of
each boundary.  You should include the last slice that contains usable image
data, and 5 to 10 slices into the section from there.  This will allow you to
see if there are trends in position within the section that need to be taken
in to account when aligning across the boundary.  In some cases, this may not
be needed, and you could choose to extract just one slice that is adequate for
alignment.  In general, it is safer to be generous in this initial sample.
     Note that the bottom of the first section and the top of the last section
will not be extracted because they do not connect to another section.
     At the same time that you are making these choices, you may also be able
to decide what range of slices from each tomogram to include in the final
volume.  You can do this for a volume that is going to be flipped or for one
that has already been flipped or rotated, but not for one that is going to be
rotated.
     When you have made all of these preliminary decisions, run Makejoincom
and answer all of the questions.  Then run the command file startjoin.com.

Aligning the Sample Slices
     Load the sample file (&quot;join_name.sample&quot;) into Imod.  This will allow you
to decide which slices are best for aligning, and to discern any trends in
structure positions that need to be accounted for.  You will probably want to
park the Imod and Zap windows so that they are readily available when running
Midas.
     Run Midas on the sample file and make the output file for transforms be
&quot;join_name.xf&quot;.  For each section boundary, you want to load in the desired
slice from the top of the lower section as the &quot;reference&quot; section and a slice
from the bottom of the upper section as the &quot;current&quot; section.  (Remember that
section numbers in Midas are one less than in Imod.)  Since these are
generally not adjacent sections, you will need to turn off the &quot;Keep Curr -
Ref diff = 1&quot; toggle button.  If you want to scroll through the sections to
select the pair to align, an easy way to do this is first to keep that button
selected, display the reference section (PageDown), and use the section up and
down arrows or the &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; hotkeys to change section until you see the
preferred section.  Then unselect the keep-difference button, display the
current section (PageUp), and use the section arrows or &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; to find
the desired current section.  After finding the best alignment for the first
pair of sections, use the same procedure to move on to the next boundary.
     Your final transform file must have only one transform that is not &quot;zero&quot;
for each section boundary.  This means that if you become unhappy with the
pair of sections that you are using and want to switch to a different pair,
you should zero out the transform with the Edit menu function &quot;Reset to Unit
Transform&quot; before switching to the new pair.  Otherwise you will end up with
an extra transform in the file, and Finishjoin will be unable to proceed.

Making the Final Joined Volume
     Once you have found the transformations and exited Midas, you need only to
decide on which slices to include from each tomogram.  You might have done
this earlier (see above), but if any of your files were rotated with
Rotatevol, you need to pick the slices from the newly created rotated
volume.

     Finally, run Finishjoin with the range of sections given for each
tomogram, for example:
 finishjoin join_name 15,89 32,95 17,82

Examine the joined volume (&quot;join_name.join&quot;) to see whether you want fewer or
more slices at any of the section boundaries.  If so, modify the Finishjoin
command and rerun it.
     Finishjoin has two options.  The -size option allows you to produce an
output volume that is smaller in X and Y than the individual tomograms, or
larger if necessary to compensate for big shifts between individual sections.
The -ref option allows you to specify one of the sections as the reference to
which the others will be aligned.  In this case, that reference section will
not be transformed and the others will be.  This could be useful, for example,
if you have already modeled on one section, or if you are adding another
section to an existing set of serial sections.  Without this option, all
tomograms will be transformed into alignment to a single average position.

     Once you are done, you should be able to delete all of the intermediate
image files that have been created.  The command file and small transform
files can be kept for future reference.</pre></body></html>
