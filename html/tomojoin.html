</H3></A>
This document describes how to join tomograms from serial sections into one
volume, using the interface in eTomo.  If you need to do this operation from
the command line instead, see the older <a href="preEtomoJoin.html">
instructions</a>.

<P>
The interface is organized into 
three panels or tabs
that will enable you to perform the following sequence of
steps:
<OL>
<LI>Determining which surfaces match with which between adjacent sections.
<LI>If necessary, flipping or rotating the volume so that slices in Z are
parallel to the plane of section;
<LI>Extracting sample slices from the section boundaries so that these
boundaries can be visualized and aligned;
<LI>Getting transformations to align the top of each section to the bottom
of the next;
<LI>Assembling the joined volume.
</OL>

The <B>Setup</B> panel manages steps 1 to 3.  It allows you to identify the
different sections and record information about the surfaces.  eTomo uses this
information to run the
program Makejoincom, which produces a command file, "startjoin.com", that
eTomo then runs to accomplish steps 2 and 3.
Step 4 in done with the <B>Align</B> panel, where you use 
<A href="man/midas.man">Midas</A> for manual alignment and you can also try
<A href="man/xfalign.man">Xfalign</A>
for automated alignment.  Step 5 is done with the <B>Join</B> panel, which 
runs the program <A href="man/finishjoin.man">Finishjoin</A>.

<P>
<A NAME = "TopBottom"><H4>
1.1. Top and Bottom
</H4></A>
     If you have N tomograms, then there are N-1 boundaries between sections.
The words "top" and "bottom" are used here with a particular meaning: 
the "bottom" of a section is the part of the tomogram that will end up at
lower Z in the final joined volume, while the "top" is the part that will end
up at higher Z in the final volume.
The
"top" of one section thus matches up with the
"bottom" of the next section higher in Z.
These words do not refer to the
high Z and low
Z portions of a tomogram, so the top of a section may be at either the high or
the low Z end.  Indeed, if you invert the order in which the tomograms are
to be stacked from low to high Z, you will change which side of each tomogram
is considered the top by this definition.  
The programs will take care of any 
inversions in Z, both in
extracting sample slices and in assembling the final volume, so you do not
need to worry about entering slice numbers in a particular order.
<P>
     If you have numbered your sections in the same order as they came off of 
the block during cutting, then the surface of a section against the formvar
should be the top, and the other surface should be the bottom.  You should be
able to distinguish these surfaces by which one has gold particles closest to
the sectioned material.
<P>
The following figures illustrate the meaning of these terms and how they
translate into slice numbers to place in eTomo's table, for a case where all
the sections have a consistent orientation.  Refer back to these figures
as you read through the more
detailed instructions below.

</div>
<A NAME = "Handedness"><H4>
1.2. Preserving or Restoring Handedness
</H4></A>
The order in which you stack the sections will determine whether the
handedness of structures is preserved or inverted from the individual
tomograms to the joined volume.  When the final joined volume is made, slices
are stacked in either original or inverted Z order, and in the latter case
handedness is inverted.  When you finish the setup process, eTomo will signal
to you whether tomograms are being inverted.  If you care about handedness, 
the points to remember are:
<UL>
<LI> Your reconstruction has true handedness if the formvar comes out on the 
same side of the section (lower or upper Z) as its physical location in the
scope.  See <A HREF="tomoguide.html#Reorienting">Reorienting the Volume</A>
in the Tomography Guide for a complete discussion of this issue.
<LI> If a reconstruction has true handedness, stack so as to avoid inverting
it.
<LI> If a reconstruction is inverted, stack so as to invert it.
</UL>
<A NAME = "Flipping"><H4>
1.3. Flipping Tomograms
</H4></A>
The interface in eTomo was designed to work only with tomograms that
have been flipped or rotated after generation so that the Z sections in the
image file correspond to actual slices in Z, parallel to the plane of
section.  If you identify a tomogram for joining that appears not to
have been flipped
in the post-processing step, eTomo will offer to flip it for you and
produce a file with extension ".flip"  in the working directory.  However,
this will invert the handedness of structures in the volume.
<P>
<A NAME = "Setup"><H3>
2. The Setup Panel
</H3></A>
To begin joining tomograms, start eTomo and select <B>New Join</B> from the
<B>File</B> menu.  This will bring up the <B>Setup</B> panel.

<P>
<A NAME = "InitialEntries"><H4>
2.1. Initial Entries
</H4></A>
After opening the <B>Setup</B> panel, you must first
make an entry for <B>Working directory</B>.
You should create a new directory for your joining operation so that it is
easy to clean up afterwards.  You do not need to copy the tomograms into this
directory.  You can use the file chooser to browse for the directory,
as well as to make a new folder and rename it to the desired name.
<P>
You must also enter a <B>Root name for output file</B>.  The
final tomogram will be named with this root name plus the extension ".join".
An addition, a host of intermediate files will be created with this root name
and other extensions.  Files will be referred to below as, for example,
"rootname.join".  In addition, eTomo will automatically save a file,
"rootname.ejf", to the working directory with all of its information about the
joining operation.  You can exit eTomo and restart where you left off by
loading this file.
<P>
<A NAME = "AddingSections"><H4>
2.2. Adding and Manipulating Sections
</H4></A>
Press <B>Add Section</B> to add a section to the table, then use the
file chooser to find the tomogram.  The program
will record the full path to the file but show only the file name.
You can press the <B>></B> button in the title line of the table to
switch back and forth between seeing the full path and just the file
name.
<P>
Once you have added a section, you need to select the section to
perform any operations on it.  This is done with the <B>=></B> button
to the left of the file name.
<P>
You can change the order of the sections in the table by selecting a
section and using <B>Move Section Up</B> or
<B>Move Section Down</B>.  You can also delete a
section if necessary.
<P>Once you have selected a section, you can view it in 3dmod by
pressing <B>Open in/Raise 3dmod</B>.  Note that you can bin the
images in X and Y to reduce the amount of memory that they will
require; this option should allow you to view several sections at once
regardless of how big they are.  Binning is only in X and Y, not in Z, so
that slice numbers will not vary with binning.

<P>
<A NAME = "Rotating"><H4>
2.3. Rotating a Section
</H4></A>
It is possible to rotate a tomogram
before joining, using <A href="man/rotatevol.man">Rotatevol</A>.  
There are three reasons to use rotations.  
<OL>
<LI> If
the surface of one section is pitched and can be made flat by a small
rotation, then the boundary between sections can be made smaller by correcting
this pitch. 
<LI> If your tomograms are not square in X and Y, and if one of them
is rotated by 90 degrees relative to an adjacent section, then you need to
rotate this tomogram to get sample slices that contain image from the whole 
area of the tomogram.  Without a rotation, sample slices from a horizontally
elongated tomogram will be chopped off when they are stacking with slices from
vertically oriented tomograms.
<LI> If one of the sections is upside-down relative to the others, then you
will not be able to match slices with the adjacent sections; when comparing
slices from adjacent surfaces it will look like one of the slices needs to be 
mirrored around the X or Y axis.  Rotating the volume by 180 degrees
around the X or Y axis will accomplish this mirroring.
</OL>
<P>
Rotations should be avoided unless they are necessary for one of these
reasons, not only to save time and disk space, but also to avoid degrading
the images by multiple transformations.  Thus, if you need to
rotate for the second reason given above, rotate by exactly 90 degrees
rather than by the angle that aligns the sections best, since the rotation
will then not require any interpolations.  Similarly, if you need to turn a
volume upside down, rotate by 180 degrees unless a different angle is needed
to correct a pitch in the reconstruction.
<P>
If you want to use <A href="man/rotatevol.man">Rotatevol</A> to adjust
the orientation of a section, then load the tomogram into 3dmod.  Open a
Slicer window and adjust the angles to achieve the desired rotation.  It may
take only a few tenths of a degree to correct significant pitch in the
section.  Use the numeric keypad arrow keys to adjust an angle by small
increments (4 and 6 for 0.1 degree increments, 2 and 8 for 0.5 degree
increments).  Once you have obtained the desired rotation, be sure the
section in question is selected in the section table, and press
<B>Get angles from slicer</B> in eTomo to get the angles entered into
the table.

<P>
<A NAME = "DecidingSlices"><H4>
2.4. Deciding on Slices to Extract
</H4></A>
You need to decide which slices to extract from the top and
bottom of each section in order to construct a file that contains a sample of
each boundary.  You should include the last slice that contains usable image
data, and 5 to 10 slices into the section from there.  This will allow you to
see if there are trends in position within the section that need to be taken
into account when aligning across the boundary.  In some cases, this may not
be needed, and you could choose to extract just one slice that is adequate for
alignment.  In general, it is safer to be generous in this initial sample.
These sample slices will also be averaged to produce images that can be used
for automatic alignment.  Enter the first and last section of each
range in the appropriate text box under <B>Start</B> and <B>End</B>,
respectively, in the <B>Sample Slices</B> area of the table.
<P>
Note that the bottom of the first section and the top of the last section
will not be extracted because they do not connect to another section.
<P>
At the same time that you are making these choices, you may also be able
to decide what range of slices from each tomogram to include in the final
volume.  Enter these choices in the text boxes in the <B>Final</B>
area of the table.  These entries will appear in italics to signify
that they are not relevant to the operation performed on this panel.  Note
that if you are rotating a section, these slice numbers picked in the original
volume will be converted to the appropriate slices in the rotated volume, and
the converted slice numbers will appear when you get to the <B>Join</B> panel.

<P>
<A NAME = "MakingSamples"><H4>
2.5. Adjusting Squeezing and Density Matching and Making Samples
</H4></A>
When the sample slices are extracted, they will be transformed if necessary so
that they are no bigger than a certain size.  This size is 1024 pixels by
default, but if your volumes are very large in X or Y this default 
may lose too much detail.  To change the default, enter a larger number in the
<B>Squeeze samples to</B> text box.
<P>
The combining procedures will scale the densities of the different
sections to match their means and standard deviations.  The same scaling
will be applied in producing both the sample slices and the final
volume.  By default, the first section will be used as the reference
for this scaling.  If this section has poor dynamic range
(i.e., black and white sliders need to be set close to each other in
3dmod to get good contrast), then all of the other sections will be
scaled to a similarly poor dynamic range.  To avoid this, select a different
section as the reference using the 
<B>Reference section for density matching</B> entry.
<P>
When all entries have been made, press <B>Make Samples</B>.  The
program will first determine the density scaling.  It will then run
<A href="man/rotatevol.man">Rotatevol</A> on any
sections that have rotation angles, producing a file with extension
".rot" in the working directory.  Finally, it will
extract the sample slices into "rootname.sample" and average them
into "rootname.sampavg".  At this point, you can go on
to the <B>Align</B> panel.

<P>
<A NAME = "ModifyingSetup"><H4>
2.6. Modifying the Setup to Make New Samples
</H4></A>
After you have made samples, most fields on the <B>Setup</B> panel
will be disabled, to prevent disagreements between the information on
this panel and the information used in later phases of the process.
If you want to make new samples with different entries, just press
<B>Change Setup</B>.  After doing this, you are free to rearrange
sections and modify entries, but you will not be able to go on to the
other panels until you have made samples again.  If you change your
mind and just want to go on, press <B>Revert to Last Setup</B> to
restore the entries that were used to make the existing samples.  This
will unlock the other tabs.

<P>
<A NAME = "InvertingTable"><H4>
2.7. Inverting the Table
</H4></A>
After you run <B>Make Samples</B>, eTomo is able to calculate whether some or
all of the sections will be inverted in the final join.  It will highlight
inverted sections with yellow in the table and warn you if morethan half are
being inverted.  At this point, you can press <B>Change Setup</B> then
<B>Invert Table</B> to invert the order of sections and change the inversion,
if this will give the desired result.  The program will manage all of the
starting and ending slice entries, so you can just go on and make new samples.
<P>
The following figures show a more complicated example illustrating rotations
and inversions.  If the sections were stacked in this order, the resulting
joined volume would be identical to the one shown above.  However, in this
case that stacking would invert the handedness, so this is a case where
inverting the table would be helpful.

<P>
<A NAME = "Align"><H3>
3. Aligning the Sample Slices
</H3></A>
The <B>Align</B> panel has three components.  There is a modified
version of the section table with information relevant to aligning the
sections; an area for setting parameters for automatic alignment, and
buttons to perform the different kinds of alignment.

<P>
<A NAME = "ManualAlignment"><H4>
3.1. Manual Alignment with Midas 
</H4></A>
<A href="midas.man">Midas</A> can be used exclusively to align the
sections manually, or it can be used to check and refine the results
from automatic alignment.
The sample slices are aligned in <A href="midas.man">Midas</A> using a
special "chunk" alignment
mode, in which you can adjust the alignment between chunks of slices while
viewing any pair of slices from the chunks.
For each section boundary, it will
initially show the slice from the top of the lower section as the <B>Reference
sec.</B> and the slice from the bottom of the upper section as the <B>Current
sec.</B>.  However, you are free to select another pair of slices for
aligning, to scroll through either set of slices to assess trends in the
structures, and to switch the pair of slices after you have started aligning.
Use the up and down arrows on the spin boxes, or the "a", "b", "c", and "d"
hot keys to move forward and back through the slices in the two sections.
Use the "Current chunk" spin box or the "A" and "B" hot keys 
to switch to a different section boundary.  If you get confused after
stepping between slices, consult the right side
of the section table, which shows the range
of slices that can validly be used as reference and current sections
for a given current chunk.

<P>
<A NAME = "AutoAlignment"><H4>
3.2. Automatic Alignment with Xfalign
</H4></A>
In some cases, automatic alignment of the sample averages with 
<A href="xfalign.man">Xfalign</A> may produce
an adequate alignment.  The interface provides for using 
<A href="xfalign.man">Xfalign</A> in two different scenarios:
getting an initial alignment that might need refinement by hand, or
refining an approximate alignment that you have made with Midas.
<OL>
<LI>Use <B>Initial Auto Alignment</B> to do an automatic alignment
from scratch, ignoring any previous alignment.
<A href="xfalign.man">Xfalign</A> will do a
cross-correlation before starting a local search for the best
alignment, in order to handle large displacements between sections.  
When you run <A href="midas.man">Midas</A> to check the alignment
after this operation, 
you may find that some or all of the transformations are
useless.  If so, use the entry "Reset to unit transform" in the
"Edit" menu to get rid
of a bad transformation, and realign manually.  Alternatively, you can
press <B>Revert to No Transforms</B> then either restart <A
href="midas.man">Midas</A> or load "rootname.xf" using "Load transforms"
in the "File" menu.
<LI>Use <B>Refine Auto Alignment</B> to do an automatic alignment that
starts from the existing alignment.  (This button label is a bit
misleading since the operation is meant to be used to refine an alignment
done with Midas; refining an automatic alignment should have no effect.)
For example, if you 
find it difficult to correct for stretching in Midas, you can try
using Xfalign to refine the transformation after you have gotten it
approximately
correct.  After running this function, you should always check the
alignment in <A href="midas.man">Midas</A> again.  If the refinement is not
successful, you can get back to the last transforms written from 
<A href="midas.man">Midas</A> by pressing <B>Revert to Midas Alignment</B>.
Again, you would have to restart <A href="midas.man">Midas</A> or reload
"rootname.xf" to work with these transforms.  There is no easy way to take
some of the refined transformations but not others; to do this you could
read "rootname.xf" into a text editor and substitute lines from
"rootname_midas.xf" for the sections that have a better alignment from 
<A href="midas.man">Midas</A>.
</OL>

<P>
<A NAME = "AutoParameters"><H4>
3.3. Parameters for Automatic Alignment
</H4></A>
By default, the automatic alignment will search for a full linear
transformation, including translation, rotation, size change, and
stretching.  If the images do not contain enough information to indicate
all of these aspects of a transformation, the search may be more successful
if you restrict the transformation.  You can select either
<B>Rotation/Translation/Magnification</B> to omit stretch from the search,
or <B>Rotation/Translation</B> to find an alignment that includes only 
rotation and translation.  These are options to try before giving up on
automatic alignment.
<P>
The filtering parameters control the degree of filtering that is applied to
the images.  <A href="xfalign.man">Xfalign</A> passes the filtered images
to <A href="xfsimplex.man">Xfsimplex</A>, which
searches for a transformation that minimizes a pixel-to-pixel difference
between the images, summed over all pixels.  This minimization is sensitive
to noise, so some high-frequency filtering is appropriate.  You might want
to reduce the <B>Cutoff for high-frequency filter</B> below 0.25 for
particularly noisy images.

<P>
<A NAME = "Joining"><H3>
4. Making the Final Joined Volume
</H3></A>
The <B>Join</B> panel shows another variant on the data table in which you
can adjust the starting and ending slices for the final volume.  The panel
also provides the ability to set
the size and centering of the volume, to generate a trial
volume quickly, and to adjust the size and centering with a rubber band in the
trial volume.

<P>
At the top of the panel is an option to 
specify one of the sections as the reference to
which the others will be aligned.  By default, all tomograms will be
transformed into alignment to a single average position.
If you turn on <B>Reference section for alignment</B> and select a section,
that section will
not be transformed and the others will be.  
This is useful if you have already
modeled on one section, or if you are adding another section to an existing
set of serial sections.  Note that if you have some sections that are rotated
by large angles (90 or 180 degrees) relative to the rest, it is no longer
necessary to set one section as a reference.  The program 
<A href="xftoxg.man">Xftoxg</A> will determine the most common orientation in
the set of sections and compute the average alignment position from the
sections at that orientation.
<P>
When you first enter the panel, it will show an output size that equals
the maximum size of the input sections.  If you have an appreciable shift
between the sections, this size may not be sufficient.  On the other hand, the
area may be more than you need.  The following
procedure is recommended:
<OL>
<LI>Press <B>Get Max Size and Shift</B> to replace the current entries in
the <B>Size</B> and <B>Offset</B> text boxes with values that will produce
a volume that contains all of the original image data.  This volume will
likely be somewhat larger than you need.  Note that these values depend on
whether a section is selected as a reference, so if you change that setting
you may need to reiterate these steps.
<LI>Depending on the size of your data set, adjust the <B>Binning in X and 
Y</B> for the trial join to 2 to 4 to generate moderate-sized images.  For
very large data sets, you can also increase the interval between slices
(<B>Use every N slices</B>) to save time.  However big you make this
number, the your chosen starting and ending slice will be included for each
section.
<LI> Press <B>Trial Join</B> to generate a trial volume named
"rootname_trial.join".  Press <B>Open Trial in 3dmod</B> to see the
volume.
<LI> Turn on the rubber band in the Zap window.  Scroll through the volume 
and adjust the rubber band size and position to enclose the area that you
want to include in the final volume.
<LI> In eTomo, press <B>Get Subarea Size and Shift</B>.  The proper size
and shift will be calculated and placed in the text boxes.
<LI> The trial volume may also reveal whether you should change the
starting and ending slices.  If so, make an appropriate change and generate
a new trial volume to see if these limits work better.
<LI> Press <B>Finish Join</B> to generate the full joined volume
"rootname.join".
<LI>Examine the joined volume ("rootname.join") to see whether you want fewer or
more slices at any of the section boundaries.  If so, change the slices
numbers in the table and repeat <B>Finish Join</B>.
</OL>
Once you are done, you should be able to delete all of the intermediate
image files that have been created (...flip, ...rot, rootname_trial.join,
rootname.sample, rootname.sampavg).  The other
files should be kept for future reference.

<P>
<A NAME = "Refining"><H3>
5. Refining the Alignment with a Fiducial Model
</H3></A>
Once you have a joined volume, it is possible to model some of the features in
the volume and use those features as fiducials for refining the alignment with 
<A href="xfjointomo.man">Xfjointomo</A>.  The model can contain pairs of points
that should correspond between two sections.  It can also contain
features such as oblique microtubules that are otherwise hard to use for
alignment because their position shifts between the top of one section and the
bottom of the next.  If there are enough data from trajectories, it is even
possible to determine the proper spacing between sections.  See the 
<A href="xfjointomo.man">Xfjointomo man page</A> for complete details on how to
prepare the model and run the program.
<P>
An interface is being planned for this refinement.  The directions below
suggest file names based on naming conventions that will be used in this
interface. 
<P>
The fiducial model can be built on the final joined file, or a binned trial
join file that includes all of the slices.  Do not use a trial join that skips
slices. 
<P>
Here is the sequence of operations for the simple case where you do not want
to adjust the spacing between sections:
<OL>
<LI> You should first rename the file that you want to model to
"rootname_modeled.join", so that it is not inadvertently lost when you rerun 
<A href="man/finishjoin.man">Finishjoin</A>.
<LI> Model features to indicate correspondences between sections.  One model
can contain the fiducials for all of the sections.  Save the model as
"rootname_refine.mod"
<LI> Collect information needed to run <A
href="xfjointomo.man">Xfjointomo</A>.  Note the number of slices in each of
the sections (referred to as {sizes} below).
The offset entry, referred to as {offset}, is the
<B>negative</B> of the values in the <B>Shift in X</B> and <B>Y</B> fields on
the <B>Join</B> panel in eTomo.
<LI> Decide what kind of transformations to solve for.
If you have enough data (at least four well-defined positions per boundary,
preferably at least 6) you can solve for linear transformations that account
for stretch.  If you have much less data on some boundaries than on others,
you may have to run <A href="xfjointomo.man">Xfjointomo</A> several
times with different specifications for the different boundaries.
<LI> Run <A href="xfjointomo.man">Xfjointomo</A> with (all on one line):
<br><code>
  xfjointomo -ed -si {sizes} -of {offset} rootname_refine.mod
  rootname_refine.xf rootname_refinejoin.xg
<br></code>
If you used a binned trial join, add "-bin" with
the binning.  Add options such as "-rot" or "-mag" to restrict the
transformation being solved for.
Add "-bound" and a list of boundary numbers (numbered from 1) to solve for
a subset of boundaries in one run.  The "-ed" option lets you run the command
several times, "editing" the transform file "rootname_refine.xf" by
accumulating results from different runs for different boundaries.
<LI> Extract the <A href="man/finishjoin.man">Finishjoin</A> command from
etomo_err.log with:
<br><pre>
  grep finishjoin etomo_err.log
</pre>
You should get something like:
<br><pre>
  finishjoin -P -s 535,460 -o 54,31 unicross 1,49 3,63 7,60
</pre>
Copy and paste this onto the command line, adding "-xf rootname_refinejoin.xg"
right after the "finishjoin".  
<LI> Run the "finishjoin" command as modified.
<LI> To transform the model into the new alignment run
<br><pre>
  xftoxg -n 0 rootname_refine.xf
  xfmodel -xf rootname_refine.xg -ch {sizes} rootname_refine.mod rootname_refine.alimod
</pre>
<LI> If need to refine the model after seeing the transformed images or model,
go back and edit the original model on the original volume,
"rootname_modeled.join". 
</OL>
The fit from this procedure may be adequate, but if you want to eliminate all
the kinks from lines passing obliquely between sections, you may need to
adjust the inter-section spacing.  You can use 
<A href="xfjointomo.man">Xfjointomo</A> to find the best
spacing between sections if your model contains some of these
oblique lines at a variety of angles.  To do so, modify the steps above as
follows:
<UL>
<LI> In step 5, add an entry such as
"gap -4,6,2" when running <A href="xfjointomo.man">Xfjointomo</A>, so that it
will fit the data with a series of assumed gaps between the sections.
<LI> In the "finishjoin" command, the pairs of numbers after the rootname are
the slices to use from each section.  They may not be in the right order,
i.e., starting slice then ending slice.  
In step 6, reorder the numbers for each section
if necessary so that the starting slice is the smaller number for sections
that were not inverted in the join and the larger number for sections that were
inverted.  If there are no inversions, the starting number should
always be less than the ending number.  Make a note of these slice numbers
in the original join.
<LI> In step 7, if you 
found that a non-zero gap gave the best solution for a boundary, you need
to add
slices to a boundary for a positive gap size and remove them for a negative
gap size in the "finishjoin" command.  You can do this by adjusting either the
ending slice before a boundary, the starting slice after a boundary, or both.
If this is not feasible, first rerun 
<A href="xfjointomo.man">Xfjointomo</A> with no gap entry for the boundary
in question, and leave the ending and starting slices on the two sides of that
boundary unchanged.
<LI> In step 8, the transformed model needs a
similar adjustment to the boundaries, which is done with:
<br><pre>
  remapmodel -from {old_slices} -to {new_slices} rootname_refine.alimod rootname_refine.remapmod
</pre>
where {old_slices} is the original list of starting and ending slices (with
spaces replaced by commas) and {new_slices} is the new list.  
</UL>
<P>
For example,
if the original list on the "finishjoin" command is "3,87 5,92 65,2" and
there were no inversions, and the best fit is found with a gap of 2 at the 
first boundary but a gap of -2 at the second boundary, then the modified
entry for "finishjoin" could be "3,88 4,92 4,65".  This adds two slices to the
first boundary, one from each section, and removes two slices from the second
boundary, both from the last section.  In this case, the aligned model would
be remapped with:
<br><pre>
  remapmodel -from 3,87,5,92,2,65 -to 3,88,4,92,4,65 rootname_refine.alimod rootname_refine.remapmod
</pre>
