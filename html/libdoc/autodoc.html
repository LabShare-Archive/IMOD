The autodoc module contains functions for reading from and writing to autodoc
type files, with named sections and key-value pairs within sections.  There is
a Fortran wrapper for every function listed here, with the same calling
conventions.  The only exception is that indices are numbered from 1 instead of
0.
<P>
The basic unit of organization in the autodoc file is the section, which
starts with a line of the form:
<BR>
[SectionType = name]
<BR>
There can be many sections of the same type, i.e., having the same key name
for the section, named <B>typeName</B> in the functions below.  Each of these
would typically have a different value for the name entry, although this is
not strictly necessary as no uniqueness is enforced and sections are not looked
up by name.  All of the sections of
the same type are held in an array, referred to as a collection, and they are
accessed by their array
index.  Thus, functions for setting or getting values from a section all
refer to the section by its <B>typeName</B> and its index <B>sectInd</B>.
<P>
Inside of a section, the autodoc contains a set lines with key-value pairs,
of the form:
<BR>
key = value
<BR>
In general, the values are stored as strings, but functions below can be used
for storing or retrieving the values from strings consisting of 1 to 3 floats
or integers.  Sections of the same type do not need to have the same set of
key-value pairs defined.
<P>
Every autodoc structure is initialized with a section for global data stored 
at the start of the file, before any actual sections are defined.  These data
are accessed by calls with a <B>typeName</B> of "PreData" and a <B>sectInd</B>
of 0.
