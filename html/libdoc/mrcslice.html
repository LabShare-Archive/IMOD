These module contain functions for working with images contained in the
Islice structure.  In general, these functions allow generic handling of 
different types of image data.  However, because many of them operate by
using a function call to get and put each individual pixel, they are not very
efficient.  The first set of basic functions are in module islice.c, part of 
libcfshr, while the rest are in mrcslice.c, part of libiimod.

they are called from options in Clip that have been disabled.
