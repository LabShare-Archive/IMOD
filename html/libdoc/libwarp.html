<H2  align="center">IMOD Library libiwarp</H2>
The libiwarp library contains routines used for working with nonlinear
transformations, referred to as warping transforms.  These warping
transforms are an extension of image distortion fields.  Current versions of
warping files can contain multiple transforms (e.g., one per section).  Each
transform consists of a linear component and a warping component.  The latter
can consist either of an array of X and Y displacements on a regular grid, or
of a list of arbitrarily located points an X/Y displacement at each (referred
to as control points).  
<P>
Calls from Fortran take the identical arguments, except as noted (string
lengths are omitted from Fortran calls).  Sections are numbered from 1 instead
of zero when calling from Fortran.

<h3><a name="formats">Warping File Format</a></h3>
The library outputs files in version 3 and can read
files in versions 1, 2, or 3.
Version 3 files start with the header lines:
<pre>
   3
   nx   ny  nz  binning  pixelSize flags
</pre>
Here
<code>nx</code> and <code>ny</code> are the sizes of the images on which
a warping or distortion field was measured,  
<br>
<code>binning</code> is relevant only for distortion fields, and is the
absolute binning of the images, including any binning on the camera
<br>
<code>pixelSize</code> is the pixel size in Angstroms of the images,
corresponding to the pixel spacing reported by the standard header output.
<br>
<code>flags</code> is an OR of a set of bit flags:
<br>
1 if the warping component is an inverse transform
<br>
2 if the warping specified by control points instead of a regular grid
<br>
For a regular grid, each transformation then has the following lines
<pre>
   xStart  xInterval   nxGrid  yStart  yInterval  nyGrid
   a11  a12  a21  a22  dx  dy
   deltaX deltaY deltaX deltaY ...
   ...
</pre>
Here,
<br>
<code>xStart, yStart</code> are coordinates of the lower left point of the grid
<br>
<code>xInterval, yInterval</code>  are the spacing between grid points in X
and Y
<br>
<code>nxGrid, nyGrid</code>  are the number of grid points in X and Y
<br>
<code>a11, a12, a21, a22, dx, dy</code> specify a forward linear transform in the
usual way, i.e.
<pre>
   x' = a11 * (x - xci) + a12 * (y - yci) + xco
   y' = a21 * (x - xci) + a22 * (y - yci) + yco
</pre>
where <code>(x, y)</code> and <code>(x', y')</code> are positions in the input and
output images, and <code>(xci, yci)</code> and <code>(xco, yco)</code> are the
centers of the input and output images.  Finally,
<br>
<code>deltaX, deltaY</code>  are the displacement vectors at the grid points,
in order by increasing X for one Y, then by increasing Y.
There may be variable numbers of entries per line (up to 50), but vectors at a new Y
value should start a new line.
<P>
The vectors and positions describe an inverse transform: a point at a grid
position in a transformed image corresponds to that position plus its
displacement vector in the original image.
<P>
For a warping file with control points, each transformation has the
following lines after the header:
<pre>
   nControl
   a11  a12  a21  a22  dx  dy
   xControl yControl deltaX deltaY
   xControl yControl deltaX deltaY
   ...
</pre>
where 
<br>
<code>nControl</code> is the number of control points, which can be zero,
<br>
<code>a11, a12, a21, a22, dx, dy</code> specify a forward linear transform as
above,
<br>
<code>xControl, yControl</code> are the coordinates of one control point in
the warped image
<br>
<code>deltaX, deltaY</code>  is the displacement vector at that point, which
is added to the control point position to get the corresponding position in
the original image.
<P>
Version 2 files could contain multiple grids of displacements, which are assumed to 
be inverse transforms, and no linear transforms.  Its form was:
<pre>
   2
   nx   ny  nz  binning    pixelSize
   xStart  xInterval   nxGrid  yStart  yInterval  nyGrid
   deltaX deltaY deltaX deltaY ...
   ...
   xStart  xInterval   nxGrid  yStart  yInterval  nyGrid
   deltaX deltaY deltaX deltaY ...
   ...
</pre>
Here one grid follows another, starting with
a line specifying the parameters for that grid
<P>
Version 1 files contained only a single grid of displacements, again assumed
to be an inverse transform, and no linear transformations.  Its form was:
<pre>
   1
   nx   ny   binning    pixelSize
   xStart  xInterval   nxGrid  yStart  yInterval  nyGrid
   deltaX deltaY deltaX deltaY ...
</pre>
