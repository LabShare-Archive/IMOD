<H2  align="center">Unit-based File I/O Module</H2>
This module contains functions for doing image-file-type independent I/O by
associating a file with an arbitrary unit number less than 1000.  It was
designed to support all existing MRC file operations in Fortran programs as
well as to be fully accessible from C.  A file unit structure contains an
ImodImageFile structure and also contains an MrcHeader structure for a file
type where the ImodImageFile does not contain one (e.g., TIFF).
<P>
Nearly all header operations will work
with all file types, although for a file type that does not support a
particular header value, a default value will be returned, and setting the
value will have no effect.  All MRC header fields are supported in HDF files.
<P>
Unless otherwise noted, Fortran wrappers use the same arguments, minus any
string lengths at the end of the argument list.  Most functions have two
wrappers, one to support existing code, one matching the longer, more
informative name of the C function.

Headers to include: iiunit.h, iimage.h
