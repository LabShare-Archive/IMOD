<H2  align="center">IMOD Library libcfshr</H2>
The libcfshr library contains various utility functions, the PIP and Autodoc
modules, and also functions
easily callable from C and Fortran.  It includes some image processing
functions, but excludes model-related ones, which are in libimod.
Modules shared with SerialEM are also maintained in this library.
<P>
Whenever the documentation indicates that a function returns a
non-zero number for an error, it returns 0 for success.
