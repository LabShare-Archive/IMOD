This module contains functions for manipulating Iview structures, which
control the model display in the model view window.  These structures also
contain object view structures, usually one per object, with nearly all of the
display properties such as color, transparency, etc, associated with
individual objects.  The model contains an array of view structures.  The
first element of this array is called the default view, and it used in 3dmod
as the primary source for display properties.  This default view does not
contain any object views; the objects themselves are the source of the
properties used to display them.  Also, the default view is not saved to the
model file.  The default view is always associated with one of the actual
views in the array, the current view.  Usually, the current view mirrors the
default view and has object views that mirror the properties of the objects.

This module also has two functions for reading and writing the image
transformation information associated with a model.
