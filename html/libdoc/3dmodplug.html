<H2  align="center">Making Plugins to 3dmod</H2>
When 3dmod starts, it attempts to load dynamic libraries from $IMOD_PLUGIN_DIR
(by default, $IMOD_DIR/lib/imodplug), from $IMOD_CALIB_DIR/plugins (by
default, /usr/local/ImodCalib/plugins) and from two other less useful
locations.  It then tries to run defined functions to confirm that they are
plugins.
<P>
This document gives some basic information about making a plugin to 3dmod and
contains the documentation of the functions in 3dmod that are normally
accessible from plugins.

<A NAME="Instructions" /A>Instructions for Making Plugins</H3>
Here are the preliminary steps:
<UL>
<LI> Get the IMOD source code.  This can be either the full source code
available to non-profit institutions or the open source subset.
<LI> You need a development version of Qt 3.
<LI> Set up the ability to build a plugin, using the old beadfixer plugin as
an example.  This should be
easy in Linux, not too hard in Mac OS X, and more difficult in Windows.
The minimal requirement is that there be a configure file produced by setup,
and some of the C libraries in buildlib.
With this, it should be possible to compile a
plugin.  The minimal sequence of operations you need to get
through is thus:
<pre>
   ./setup
   (cd libimod ; make)
   (cd libcfshr ; make)
   (cd libdiaqt ; make)
   make plugs
</pre>
In Linux, setup will run with no Fortran compiler and libraries
should build with no problem. On Mac OS X, setup
will run with no Fortran compiler, although this will require
"setup -c gnu" at least on the
Intel Mac.  In
Windows, setup will run with no Fortran compiler but you will probably need
the Intel C++ compiler.  If you need to access any other C libraries from your
plugin, you would need to build them as well.  "make clibs" builds all C
libraries.  If you need to build libiimod, you will need a tiff library: in
Mac OS X, this would be installed in the system; on Windows, you would need
libtiff.lib in buildlib.  See how much easier Linux is?

<LI> You will want access to the library documentation, which is not available
even in the full source package without running "make man".  It is better to
access the documentation in a binary installation of IMOD.  Documentation on
our website is only updated upon major releases.
</UL>
<P>
<B>Beadfixer example.</B> The plugin in IMOD/plugs/beadfix is an old version
of the Bead Fixer that was retained to test the ability to build and run
plugins, and now serves as an example of a plugin.  It is not ideal because it
has much more functionality than is needed to illustrate the various features
of a plugin.  You can concentrate on the implementation of the generic
plugin functions in the beginning of the file and ignore most of the class
implementation.  The functional components do provide examples of how to
access and manipulate model structures.  There is one major deficiency in this
example; it has not been updated to show the proper handling of calls to the
undo/redo module.  If your plugin modifies the model, you should try to make
these calls, as documented below.  For examples, you can look in corresponding
places in the current beadfix.cpp in the imod directory and in other places in
the 3dmod code (grep on "undo").
<P>
<B>Public versus Private Structures.</B> The beadfixer example is set up to
access the model only by passing pointers to functions that operate on the
underlying structures, rather than by accessing structure members directly.
This method of defining structures as private was set up by Jim Kremer when he
first developed the plugin interface; it has been retained but not extended to
cover some new model structures or other structures in the IMOD libraries.
It is possible to define a flag to eliminate the private structures and allow
access to structure members.  The advantages of keeping the structures private
are 1) it insulates your plugin against changes in the structure members so
that it does not have to be recompiled after such changes; 2) it is a little
more object-oriented.  The disadvantages are: 1) it is a little clumsier than
operating directly on structure members, particularly when looping on contours
and objects; and 2) you may find that there is no function to perform a needed
operation on a structure member.  In the latter case, we can easily add such
functions, but then you will be constrained to running with the latest IMOD.
It is recommended that you try to keep the structures private when you start
work on a plugin, and only switch to accessing structure members if that turns
out to be necessary.
<P>
<B>Exported Functions and Include Files.</B> In Linux and Mac OS X, all global
functions in 3dmod are available to a plugin; whereas in Windows, only
functions that are
explicitly exported (using DLL_EX_IM) are available.  For portability, it is
recommended that you use only the exported functions.  If you find that you
need other functions, we can in most cases easily add the export macro and
shift them from private to public header files. 
If you look at the plugin Makefile, you will see that it
copies several headers from the imod directory instead of adding that
directory to the include path.  These are the headers needed
for all the exported functions in 3dmod.  All of the headers in IMOD/include
are also available to a plugin since that directory is on the include path.
All C library functions should be available to a plugin.
<P>
<B>ImodView Structure.</B> Many of the functions for interacting with 3dmod
pass a pointer to an ImodView structure.  This structure has all the
information about the data loaded into 3dmod.  In principle, there could be
more than one such structure, allowing a multi-document type interface; but
this capability has never been implemented, so there is just the one ImodView
structure in the application.  Nevertheless, we keep passing it around.
<P>
<B>Dialog Manager and Drawing Control Functions.</B> Every window, either
dialog or graphical display, must register with a dialog manager.  There is
one dialog manager for 3dmod windows and one for model view windows.  Plugins
would register with imodDialogManager (since plugins to model view are not
yet allowed).  Follow the example of what beadfixer does to avoid crashes upon
closing the window or exiting the program.  Image drawing windows have the
additional need to register themselves as drawing "controls" so that they get
drawn at appropriate times.  See the code for image drawing windows for
examples of how this is done; locator.cpp would be the simplest.
<P>
<B>Sharing You Plugin.</B> If your plugin is generally useful, you may want
other people to have access to it.  First note the constraints imposed by
using Qt.  In general, to distribute software using Qt, you must either hold a
Qt license or make the source available under an open source license (either
GPL or the Q Public License, as far as we could tell).  The Qt-related
components of IMOD are open source under the GPL.  With this in mind, there
are at least three ways in which a plugin could be distributed:
<OL>
<LI> You build your plugin on whatever platforms you want to manage, and make
it available for users to place in an appropriate directory.
<LI> You contribute your code for incorporation into the IMOD source, and we
would include the plugin in IMOD distributions for all platforms.  The plugin
would also be included in our open source releases.
<LI> If for some reason you still want to control the distribution, but want
the benefit of our building infrastructure, you could
contribute the code to the IMOD source but have us leave the plugin out of the
install (as the beadfixer example is).  We would provide you with copies of
the plugin on the various platforms at the time of our major releases.   The
plugin would still be included in our open source releases.
