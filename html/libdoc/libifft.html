The IMOD library libifft contains functions for performing 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D
Fourier transforms, callable from C or Fortran.  The FFT routines were written
by Lynn Ten Eyck, wrapper routines were written by David Agard, and it was
translated from Fortran to C by David Mastronarde.
<P>
In these routines, all dimensions being transformed must be even and their
largest prime factors must be no larger than 19.  All transforms are done in
place and a normalization is applied in each case.  The X dimension of the
array must always be dimensioned to 2 more than the dimension of the real
space image to allow space for an extra column of complex numbers.  The sizes
passed to the routines are always the real-space image sizes.  Thus, in
Fortran, an array would be dimensioned as:
<BR>
<PRE>
     real*4 array(nx+2, ny)
or:
     complex array((nx+2)/2, ny)
</PRE>
<P>
There are no separate Fortran wrappers for these routines; their names are
defined so that they can be called directly from Fortran.
From C, include "cfft.h" to have the function name defined with an underscore
on Unix-type systems and with capital letters on Windows.  Pass all arguments
by reference (as pointers).
<P>
All functions exit with an error message to standard out if the image size
is not allowed or the direction parameter is incorrect.
