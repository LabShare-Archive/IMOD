The IMOD library libifft contains functions for performing 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D
Fourier transforms, callable from C or Fortran.  If IMOD is built with FFTW
libraries, then the routines here are mostly wrappers to calls to FFTW, with
some logic to handle thread number.  Otherwise, the librayr contains 
FFT routines written by Lynn Ten Eyck, and wrapper routines written by David
Agard, which were translated from Fortran to C by David Mastronarde.
<P>
In these routines, all dimensions being transformed must be even and their
largest prime factors must be no larger than 19.  All transforms are done in
place and a normalization is applied in each case.  The X dimension of the
array must always be dimensioned to 2 more than the dimension of the real
space image to allow space for an extra column of complex numbers.  The sizes
passed to the routines are always the real-space image sizes.  Thus, in
Fortran, an array would be dimensioned as:
<BR>
<PRE>
     real*4 array(nx+2, ny)
or:
     complex array((nx+2)/2, ny)
</PRE>
<P>
There are no separate Fortran wrappers for these routines; their names are
defined so that they can be called directly from Fortran.
From C, include "cfft.h" to have the function name defined with an underscore
on Unix-type systems and with capital letters on Windows.  Pass all arguments
by reference (as pointers), or use the odfftc, todfftc, and thrdfftc functions calls.
<P>
All functions exit with an error message to standard out if the image size
is not allowed or the direction parameter is incorrect.
