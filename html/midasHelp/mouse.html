<LI>Left Button:&emsp;Translation of current section.
<BR>Press and hold the button and move the mouse to drag the section to the
desired location relative to the reference
section.
<LI>Middle Button:&emsp;Rotation of current section.
<BR>Position the mouse near the edge of the image, press and hold the button,
and move the mouse tangentially around the center of rotation (yellow star).
The current section will rotate by a corresponding amount relative to the
reference section.
<LI>Right Button:&emsp;Stretch of current section.
<BR>Position the mouse near the edge of the image along the desired axis of
stretch.  Press and hold the button, and move the mouse radially away from or
toward the center of rotation (yellow star).  The current section will stretch
or compress by a corresponding amount along the radial axis, relative to the
reference section.  Stretch behaves differently with a second fixed point (red
star).  In this case, position the mouse far from the line between the center of
rotation and the fixed point, and move it in any direction.  The image will
stretch and skew by a corresponding amount.
<LI>[Shift] + Right Button:&emsp;Magnification of current section.
<BR>Position the mouse near the edge of the image, press and hold the Shift key,
press and hold the mouse button, and move the mouse radially away from or toward
the center of rotation.  The current section will expand or shrink by a
corresponding amount relative to the reference section.
<LI>[Ctrl] + Left Button:&emsp;Shift zoomed-up image in window.
<BR>When the whole image does not fit in the window, press and hold the Ctrl
key, press and hold the mouse button, and move the mouse to drag the image to
the desired position in the window.
<LI>[Ctrl] + Middle Button: Move the center of rotation and stretch.
<BR>Position the mouse at the desired center of rotation, press and hold the
Ctrl key, and click the mouse button to specify the new position.
<LI>[Ctrl] + Right Button:&emsp;Toggle second fixed point for stretch.
Position the mouse at the desired fixed point, press and hold the Ctrl key, and
click the mouse button to specify the fixed point.  The fixed point is turned
off by clicking again.
