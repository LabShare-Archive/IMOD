<A NAME = "Section"><H3>Section Controls</H3>
<DL>
<DT><B>Reference Sec.</B> and <B>Current Sec.</B>
<DD>The two spin boxes show the section numbers (numbered from 1) of the
reference and current sections.  The section can be changed as desired by typing
a number in one of the text boxes or by pressing the up or down arrow buttons.
<DT><B>Keep Cur - Ref diff = 1</B>
<DD>If the <B>Keep Cur - Ref diff = 1</B> check box is selected, both reference
and current sections will be changed in tandem.  (This control is not present in
reference alignment mode or when aligning chunks.)
<DT><B>Current Chunk</B>
<DD>When aligning chunks of sections, there is another spin box for selecting
the current chunk.  Alignment is always between successive chunks.  The current
section is constrained to stay within the current chunk and the reference
section is constrained to stay within the previous chunk.  When a pair of chunks
is first selected, the lowest section of the current chunk and the highest
section of the previous chunk will be displayed.
</DL>
<A NAME = "Contrast"><H3>Contrast Controls</H3>
<DL>
<DT><B>Black</B> and <B>White</B> sliders
<DD>The <B>Black</B> and <B>White</B> sliders control the intensity range that
will be scaled to run from black to white on the screen.  Ordinarily, the
program will update the display continuously while a slider is dragged.  If the
update is too slow, you can press the [Ctrl] key to make the display update only
when the mouse button is released, just as in 3dmod.
<DT><B>Apply to only one sec.</B>
<DD>Each section has its own independent contrast setting.  If the <B>Apply to
only one sec.</B> check box is not selected, then changing the contrast (via the
sliders or F1-F8 keys) will adjust the contrast for all sections in parallel.
If this check box is selected, then changes will adjust the contrast for just
one section, the one currently being displayed (or the current section, if the
display shows both sections in overlay.)
<DT><B>Auto Contrast</B>
<DD>The <B>Auto Contrast</B> button will adjust the contrast based on the mean
and standard deviation of the currently displayed section (or the current
section, if the display shows an overlay).  The contrast setting is the same as
the default for auto contrast setting in 3dmod.
</DL>
<A NAME = "Display"><H3>Display Controls</H3>
<DL>
<DT><B>Zoom</B>
<DD>The Up and Down Arrows for <B>Zoom</B> increase and decrease the zoom of the
display.  Fractional zooms are possible, and needed for large images.
<DT><B>Block size</B>
<DD>The Up and Down Arrows for <B>Block size</B> increase and decrease the block
size for image transformation.  The larger the size, the faster images can be
transformed, but the poorer the image quality, especially if there is
substantial rotation of the transformed image.
<DT><B>Interpolate</B>
<DD>The <B>Interpolate</B> check box can be used to turn on bilinear
interpolation in the image transformation, which will give the most accurate
transformed image of the current section but will be slow for large images.
<DT><B>Overlay view</B>
<DD>The <B>Overlay view</B> box can be used to toggle between showing one
section and showing the two sections in overlay, with the current section in
green and the previous in magenta.
<DT><B>Toggle Ref/Cur</B>
<DD>The <B>Toggle Ref/Cur</B> button provides an easy way to toggle between
current and reference sections with a mouse button.
</DL>
<A NAME = "Transformation"><H3>Transformation Controls</H3>
At the top of this section are three lines listing the actions of the left, 
middle, and right mouse buttons.  The second line shows the actions when the
Ctrl key is pressed, the third shows actions when the Shift key is pressed,
and the first shows actions when neither is pressed.  The currently active
line will appear in red, and it will change to indicate the current action
when a mouse button is pressed.
<P>
The Arrow buttons allow each transformation parameter to be changed by a
selected increment.  There is an additive increment for translation, an
independent increment for rotation angle, and a multiplicative factor for
magnification and stretching.
<P>
The <B>Stretch Angle</B> slider sets the axis along which the section will be
stretched by either an Arrow button or a hotkey.  This axis is shown by the red
dashed line.  If the section has already been stretched, the axis of that actual
stretch is shown with a blue dashed line.
<P>
If the program was started with "-a" to specify a <B>Global rotation</B> angle,
this angle is displayed and can be adjusted with the spin box below the
<B>Stretch Angle</B> slider.  Use the up and down arrows to adjust the angle by
1 degree, or type in a new value directly.  Select <B>Mouse shifts X only</B> to
constrain translation changes with the mouse to the X direction in the rotated
images.  With this constraint, it is still possible to change the shift in Y
with the arrow hot keys or the Y translation arrow buttons.
<P>
If the program was started with "-t" and a file of tilt angles, then two more
controls appear.  Select <B>Apply cosine stretch</B> to stretch the current
image along the X axis by the ratio of the cosines of the current and
reference image tilt angles.  They should be easier to line up with this
stretching.  Below this checkbox is <B>Tilt angle offset</B> spin box to allow
you to adjust the tilt angles by a constant amount.  For very high tilt
angles, this offset may be needed to get the right amount of cosine stretching.
<P>
Rotation, magnification, and stretch will occur around the center of rotation,
which is marked by the yellow star.  You can use [Ctrl]+Middle-Mouse-Button to
move this center to a point that you want to keep fixed during further changes
of the transformation.  You can also set up a second fixed point using
[Ctrl]+Right-Mouse-Button, after which stretching with the mouse will keep both
the center and this fixed point at constant positions.
<P>
Correcting image stretch can be nonintuitive when done just with a regular
stretch.  Here is a procedure to follow using stretching with a second fixed
point:
<OL>
<LI>Translate to align the images at some location.
<LI>Move the center point to that location.
<LI>Rotate and stretch to align the images at a second, distant location.
<LI>Set a second fixed point at that location.
<LI>Stretch with the right mouse button to align the images in other places.
<LI>If the images are still not aligned well enough, pick a new center point and
second fixed point at two well-separated places where they now seem best
aligned, and stretch again.
</OL>
<A NAME = "File"><H3>File Menu Items</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>Load Transforms</B>:&emsp;will load transforms from a file.  If the set
of transforms currently in the program have not been saved since they were last
changed, the program will first ask if you want to save those transforms.  After
loading transforms from a file, that file becomes the file to which transforms
will be saved.
<LI><B>Save Transforms</B>:&emsp;will save the transforms to the current
transform file, or to a new file that you specify, if no such file has been
defined yet.
<LI><B>Save Transforms As...</B>:&emsp;will save the transforms to a new file
that you specify.
<LI><B>Save Contrast-scaled Image...</B>:&emsp;will make a copy of the image
file, stretching the contrast for each section by its respective Black and White
levels, as well as applying any global scaling that was specified with the -s
option when starting the program.  Images will NOT be transformed; that should
be done with Newstack.  A byte file will be created regardless of the mode of
the input file.
<LI><B>Transform Model</B>:&emsp;will transform a model using the current set of
transformations.
</UL>
<A NAME = "Edit"><H3>Edit Menu Items</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>Store Section Transform</B>:&emsp;will store the transform for the
current section in the internal list of transformations.
<LI><B>Reset to Unit Transform</B>:&emsp;will set the transform for the current
slice to unity (no translation, rotation, etc.).
<LI><B>Revert to Stored Transform</B>:&emsp;will restore the transform for the
current section from the transform stored in the internal list.
<LI><B>Mirror around X axis</B>:&emsp;will apply an additional transformation to
the current section to mirror it around the X axis.  To mirror around the Y axis
just rotate by 180 degrees before or after this operation.
</UL>
<A NAME = "Controls"><H3>Controls when Fixing Montages</H3>
X edges are between adjacent pieces in a row and are numbered from left to right
in the bottom row, next row, etc.  Y edges are between adjacent pieces in a
column and are numbered from bottom to top in the left-most column, next column,
etc.
<P>
In the top panel, the X and Y radio buttons can be used to select which type of
edge, if there is more than one type of edge in a section.  The edge number is
displayed in a spin box and can be changed by typing a new number into the text
box or by pressing the up and down arrow buttons.
<P>
Only X and Y translations of one piece relative to another can be changed when
fixing montages.
<P>
The bottom panel displays information about the errors in fitting pieces
together with the current displacements and allows one to go to the edges with
the highest error.  An error is the difference (or distance) between the
displacement between pieces implied by the X and Y translation values at that
edge, and the displacement achieved when all pieces are shifted into best
alignment using the translation values for all of the edges.
<P>
For the edges with the four highest errors, the edge number and error are
displayed in a button, which can be pressed to make that edge be the current
edge.  The errors, and even the edges, displayed in these buttons will change
whenever the displacement at the current edge is changed.
<P>
Below the buttons are the X and Y components of the error at the current edge.
On the line below that is the "Leave-out" error for the current edge, which is
its error when its translation values are left out when solving for the best fit
between pieces.  This error can be compared directly with any mismatch observed
between the pieces.  Pressing the <B>Apply Leave-out Error</B> button will change the
X and Y translations by these amounts.
