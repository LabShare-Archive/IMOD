<A NAME = "Section"><H3>Section Controls</H3>
<DL>
<DT><B>Reference Sec.</B> and <B>Current Sec.</B>
<DD>The two spin boxes show the section numbers (numbered from 1) of the
reference and current sections.  The section can be changed as desired by typing
a number in one of the text boxes or by pressing the up or down arrow buttons.
<DT><B>Keep Cur - Ref diff = 1</B>
<DD>If the <B>Keep Cur - Ref diff = 1</B> check box is selected, both reference
and current sections will be changed in tandem.  (This control is not present
when aligning chunks.)
<DT><B>Current Chunk</B>
<DD>When aligning chunks of sections, there is another spin box for selecting
the current chunk.  Alignment is always between successive chunks.  If the
  chunks are specified with the number of slices in each chunk (the <B>-c</B>
  option), the current section is constrained to stay within the current chunk
  and the reference section is constrained to stay within the previous chunk.
  If the chunks are specified by the number of slices in each sample from a chunk
  (the <B>-cs</B> option), the selected section is constrained to stay within
  its respective sample.  When a pair of chunks is first selected, the lowest
  section of the current chunk and the highest section of the previous chunk
  will be displayed.
</DL>
<A NAME = "Contrast"><H3>Contrast Controls</H3>
<DL>
<DT><B>Black</B> and <B>White</B> sliders
<DD>The <B>Black</B> and <B>White</B> sliders control the intensity range that
will be scaled to run from black to white on the screen.  Ordinarily, the
program will update the display continuously while a slider is dragged.  If the
update is too slow, you can press the [Ctrl] key to make the display update only
when the mouse button is released, just as in 3dmod.
<DT><B>Apply to only one sec.</B>
<DD>Each section has its own independent contrast setting.  If the <B>Apply to
only one sec.</B> check box is not selected, then changing the contrast (via the
sliders or F1-F8 keys) will adjust the contrast for all sections in parallel.
If this check box is selected, then changes will adjust the contrast for just
one section, the one currently being displayed (or the current section, if the
display shows both sections in overlay.)
<DT><B>Auto Contrast</B>
<DD>The <B>Auto Contrast</B> button will adjust the contrast based on the mean
and standard deviation of the currently displayed section (or the current
section, if the display shows an overlay).  The contrast setting is the same as
the default for auto contrast setting in 3dmod.
</DL>
<A NAME = "Display"><H3>Display Controls</H3>
<DL>
<DT><B>Zoom</B>
<DD>The Up and Down Arrows for <B>Zoom</B> increase and decrease the zoom of the
display.  Fractional zooms are possible, and needed for large images.
<DT><B>Interpolate</B>
<DD>The <B>Interpolate</B> check box can be used to turn on bilinear
interpolation in the image transformation, which will give the most accurate
transformed image of the current section but may be slow for large images.
<DT><B>Overlay view</B>
<DD>The <B>Overlay view</B> box can be used to toggle between showing one
section and showing the two sections in overlay, with the current section in
green and the previous in magenta.
<DT><B>Toggle Ref/Cur</B>
<DD>The <B>Toggle Ref/Cur</B> button provides an easy way to toggle between
current and reference sections with a mouse button.
</DL>
<A NAME = "Transformation"><H3>Transformation Controls</H3>
At the top of this section are three lines listing the actions of the left, 
middle, and right mouse buttons.  The second line shows the actions when the
Ctrl key is pressed, the third shows actions when the Shift key is pressed,
and the first shows actions when neither is pressed.  The currently active
line will appear in red, and it will change to indicate the current action
when a mouse button is pressed.
<P>
The <B>Add/edit warp points</B> check box can be used to warp the image, using
local shifts at a set of points called control points.  Once this is turned on,
the only transformation parameter that can be changed is the shift of the
current control point.  See the <B>Warping Images</B> section of the man page 
for a description of using warping.
<P>
The Arrow buttons allow each transformation parameter to be changed by a
selected increment.  There is an additive increment for translation, an
independent increment for rotation angle, and a multiplicative factor for
magnification and stretching.
<P>
The <B>Stretch Angle</B> slider sets the axis along which the section will be
stretched by either an Arrow button or a hotkey.  This axis is shown by the red
dashed line.  If the section has already been stretched, the axis of that
actual stretch is shown with a blue dashed line.
<P>
Rotation, magnification, and stretch will occur around the center of rotation,
which is marked by the yellow star.  You can use [Ctrl]+Middle-Mouse-Button to
move this center to a point that you want to keep fixed during further changes
of the transformation.  You can also set up a second fixed point using
[Ctrl]+Right-Mouse-Button, after which stretching with the mouse will keep both
the center and this fixed point at constant positions.
<P>
Correcting image stretch can be nonintuitive when done just with a regular
stretch.  Here is a procedure to follow using stretching with a second fixed
point:
<OL>
<LI>Translate to align the images at some location.
<LI>Move the center point to that location.
<LI>Rotate and stretch to align the images at a second, distant location.
<LI>Set a second fixed point at that location.
<LI>Stretch with the right mouse button to align the images in other places.
<LI>If the images are still not aligned well enough, pick a new center point
and second fixed point at two well-separated places where they now seem best
aligned, and stretch again.
</OL>
<P>
The same thing can be accomplished in a similar way
by adding only 3 warping points, which still leaves just a linear
transformation.
<OL>
<LI>Translate to align the images at some location.
<LI>Turn on <B>Add/edit warp points</B>.
<LI>Add one point at the aligned location.
<LI>Add a second point at a second, distant location and shift to align the
images there.
<LI>Add a third point and shift it to give the best overall alignment with a
stretch.
</OL>
<P>
The <B>Cross-Correlate</B> button can be used to align the images by
cross-correlating them in a square area around the center point marked with the
yellow star.  The program will search for peaks in the cross-correlation of
padded and filtered extracts from the two images, then evaluate the
correlation coefficient for peaks within a certain range of the origin and
pick the peak with the highest correlation.  The size of the region being
correlated can be set in the <B>Box</B> spin box, and the limit on the shift
in X and Y that can be found is adjusted with the <B>Limit</B> spin box.
These shifts are incremental to the current translation between images, so
if you adjust the translation approximately, the correlation should be able to
find a small shift to refine your translation.  The parameters for padding and
filtering are based on the settings that are most successful in Blendmont
when finding overlaps between adjacent pieces.
<P>
The extent of the area being correlated is shown temporarily when any of the
related controls are used.  The box is drawn in yellow when the size or shift
limit is adjusted; it is drawn in green after a correlation that succeeds in
giving a peak and in red when the correlation fails to yield a peak within the
shift limit.
<P>
Below the cross-correlation controls are some buttons that become active when
there are more than 3 warping points, and that may be useful when reading in a
warping transformation computed by cross-correlation.  The <B>Biggest</B>
button will
select the warping point that has the largest shift.  The down and up arrows
will move from the currently selected warping point to the one with the next
lower or next higher shift.  Turn on the <B>Draw warp vectors</B> checkbox to
see a line representing the amount of shift at each warp point.
<P>
If the program was started with "-a" to specify a <B>Global rotation</B> angle,
this angle is displayed and can be adjusted with the spin box below the
<B>Stretch Angle</B> slider.  Use the up and down arrows to adjust the angle by
1 degree, or type in a new value directly.  Select <B>Mouse shifts X only</B> to
constrain translation changes with the mouse to the X direction in the rotated
images.  With this constraint, it is still possible to change the shift in Y
with the arrow hot keys or the Y translation arrow buttons.
<P>
If the program was started with "-t" and a file of tilt angles, then two more
controls appear.  Select <B>Apply cosine stretch</B> to stretch the current
image along the X axis by the ratio of the cosines of the current and
reference image tilt angles.  They should be easier to line up with this
stretching.  Below this checkbox is the <B>Tilt angle offset</B> spin box to
allow you to adjust the tilt angles by a constant amount.  For very high tilt
angles, this offset may be needed to get the right amount of cosine stretching.
<A NAME = "File"><H3>File Menu Items</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>Load Transforms</B>:&emsp;will load transforms from a file.  If the set
of transforms currently in the program have not been saved since they were last
changed, the program will first ask if you want to save those transforms.  After
loading transforms from a file, that file becomes the file to which transforms
will be saved.
<LI><B>Save Transforms</B>:&emsp;will save the transforms to the current
transform file, or to a new file that you specify, if no such file has been
defined yet.
<LI><B>Save Transforms As...</B>:&emsp;will save the transforms to a new file
that you specify.
<LI><B>Save Contrast-scaled Image...</B>:&emsp;will make a copy of the image
file, stretching the contrast for each section by its respective Black and White
levels, as well as applying any global scaling that was specified with the -s
option when starting the program.  Images will NOT be transformed; that should
be done with Newstack.  A byte file will be created regardless of the mode of
the input file.
<LI><B>Transform Model</B>:&emsp;will transform a model using the current set of
transformations.
</UL>
<A NAME = "Edit"><H3>Edit Menu Items</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>Store Section Transform</B>:&emsp;will store the transform for the
current section in the internal list of transformations.
<LI><B>Reset to Unit Transform</B>:&emsp;will set the transform for the current
slice to unity (no translation, rotation, etc.).
<LI><B>Revert to Stored Transform</B>:&emsp;will restore the transform for the
current section from the transform stored in the internal list.
<LI><B>Mirror around X axis</B>:&emsp;will apply an additional transformation to
the current section to mirror it around the X axis.  To mirror around the Y axis
just rotate by 180 degrees before or after this operation.
</UL>
<A NAME = "Controls"><H3>Controls when Fixing Montages</H3>
X edges are between adjacent pieces in a row and are numbered from left to
right in the bottom row, next row, etc.  Y edges are between adjacent pieces
in a column and are numbered from bottom to top in the left-most column, next
column, etc.  Every edge can also be identified by its lower piece, namely the
piece to the left of an X edge and below a Y edge.
<P>
In the top panel, the X and Y radio buttons can be used to select which type of
edge, if there is more than one type of edge in a section.  The edge number is
displayed in a spin box and can be changed by typing a new number into the text
box or by pressing the up and down arrow buttons.  In addition, the position
within the montage of the 
lower piece of an edge is displayed in X and Y spin boxes; these piece
positions are numbered from 1.  These spin boxes provide a more convenient way
to know where an edge is and navigate between edges, such as to see all of the
edges around a particular piece.
<P>
The <B>Exclude edge</B> checkbox allows you to exclude an edge from further
consideration both in Midas and in Blendmont.
If you excluded edges with a model file when running Blendmont, it will
already be marked as excluded here.  When the next checkbox,
<B>Skip excluded edges</B>, 
is on, the program will skip over excluded edges
when you move between edges with the controls, and it will omit these edges
from any error computations (see below). 
If you excluded any edges with a model, this option will be turned on by
default; otherwise, you need to turn it on when you first exclude edges.
Turn this option off to go to any of
these edges in order to include them again and adjust their displacements.
<P>
Only X and Y translations of one piece relative to another can be changed when
fixing montages.
<P>
Cross-correlation can be used when fixing edges; it may be more successful
than the correlation within Blendmont because you can select the center of the
area to correlate.  The area correlated
corresponds to the intersection of the region where the two pieces overlap and
the square correlation box shown on the screen.
<P>
The bottom panel displays information about the errors in fitting pieces
together with the current displacements and allows one to go to the edges with
the highest error.  An error is the difference (or distance) between the
displacement between pieces implied by the X and Y translation values at that
edge, and the displacement achieved when all pieces are shifted into best
alignment using the translation values for all of the edges.
<P>
For the edges with the six highest errors, the edge number and error are
displayed in a button, which can be pressed to make that edge be the current
edge.  The errors, and even the edges, displayed in these buttons will change
whenever the displacement at the current edge is changed.  You can select the
number of buttons to display (between 2 and 10) with the "-e" option when
starting the program.
<P>
Below the buttons are the X and Y components of the error at the current edge.
On the line below that is the "Leave-out" error for the current edge, which is
its error when its translation values are left out when solving for the best
fit between pieces.  This error can be compared directly with any mismatch
observed between the pieces.  Pressing the <B>Apply Leave-out Error</B> button
will change the X and Y translations by these amounts.
<P>
When there are more than 10 pieces, the program can do robust fitting to
eliminate outlying displacements from the estimation of piece shifts.  This
procedure is enabled with the <B>Robust fits</B> checkbox, which is on by
default.  It will accentuate the errors of the outliers when there are many
pieces and make it easier to find these edges and either exclude them or fix
their displacements.  A spin box allows the criterion for outlier elimination
to be adjusted.  See the man page for more details.
<P>
When there are over 625 pieces, the errors are estimated using local patches
of pieces in order to save time, so they may not exactly match the values in
Blendmont.  With many thousands of pieces, the error computation may
noticeably slow down the program when moving between edges.  There is a
checkbox, <B>Skip error computation</B>, to avoid this delay when browsing
through edges.
