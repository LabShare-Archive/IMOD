<P>
This document gives an overview and some background information on the
tools available in IMOD for aligning images from serial sections.  First there
is a description of the transformations that are used for aligning images and
the ways that their parameters are represented.  There follows an explanation
of why it is necessary to process transformations before they can be used to
align serial images.  Three ways of obtaining transformations are then
described, followed by more detailed explanations of the options for
processing transformations for particular kinds of data sets.

<H3><A NAME = "Linear"></A>Linear Transformations</H3>
<P>
Two images can be aligned by applying a coordinate transformation to
one image to make the transformed image match the other image as well as
possible.  The transformations used for alignment are general linear
transformations.  This means that the same amount of translation, rotation or
distortion happens everywhere in an image.  Our programs use three different
ways of representing transformations.  The parameters in these different
representations are referred to as "formal", "semi-natural", or "natural".
<P>
The formal parameters are the matrix coefficients that are actually used
to transform image coordinates.  There are six formal parameters in a linear
transformation: the new X-coordinate of a point is a linear combination of its
old X and Y coordinates, plus a constant offset, so three parameters determine
the new X-coordinate; similarly, the other 3 parameters determine the new
Y-coordinate.  The equations are
<pre>
     X' = A11 * (X - Xcen) + A12 * (Y - Ycen) + DX + Xcen
     Y' = A21 * (X - Xcen) + A22 * (Y - Ycen) + DY + Ycen
</pre>
where <code>Xcen</code> and <code>Ycen</code> are the center coordinates of
the image, so that rotation and scaling occurs about this center.
<P>
For example, if the image is rotated by some angle theta, A11 and A22 are
cos(theta), and A21 and A12 are sin(theta) and -sin(theta).  In general, the
DX and DY correspond to X and Y displacements of the image after the rotations
and distortions specified by the A matrix.  The disadvantage of the formal
parameters is that the geometrical changes in the image (rotation, size
change, and stretch) are all mixed together in the four matrix parameters.
This makes the transformation hard to interpret intuitively, and also prevents
programs from treating different kinds of changes in different ways.
<P>
The semi-natural parameters partly alleviate these difficulties by
expressing the A matrix in terms of a global rotation, a global magnification,
a difference between the rotation of the X and Y axes, and a difference
between the stretches along the X and Y axes.  This is done quite easily
because two of the parameters (A11 and A21) specify how a unit vector along
the X-axis is transformed, which directly indicates how much the X-axis is
rotated and stretched by the transformation.  Similarly, the other two matrix
parameters (A12 and A22) indicate how much the Y-axis is rotated and
stretched.  The global rotation is the average of the two axis rotations, and
the global magnification is the average of the two stretches.  Although the
stretch is not expressed very intuitively, the effects of the different
changes have been separated out in the semi-natural parameters, so they are
used by programs that need to treat the different changes differently.
<P>
The natural parameters are the most intuitive ones: global rotation,
global magnification, and stretch along an axis at a particular angle.  These
still constitute four parameters because stretch amount and stretch axis angle
are two separate parameters.  One can directly convert these four natural
parameters into an A matrix with equations that involve lots of sines and
cosines.  Given an A matrix, it is also possible (but even more complex) to
solve for the corresponding natural parameters.  Most of the programs used for
alignment deal only with the formal transform parameters; a few programs work
with the semi-natural parameters; and the program that provides interactive
adjustment of alignment allows one to specify changes in the fully natural
parameters.
<P>
Transforms stored in a file are represented by formal parameters.  Each
line of the file specifies:
<pre>
   A11   A12   A21   A22   DX  DY
</pre>
The program <A HREF = "man/xf2rotmagstr.html#TOP">Xf2rotmagstr</A> can be used to
convert the transforms in a file into natural parameters.

<h3><A NAME = "FandG"></A>F and G Transforms</h3>
Whenever there are more than two images, a series of transforms will be
needed to align the whole stack of images.  This series is obtained in two
stages.  First, each successive pair of images is considered separately, and a
transform is found that aligns the images when applied to the second image in
the pair.  This procedure yields a list of transforms that align each image to
the previous image; the programs consistently refer to this as a list of "<b>f</b>"
transforms.  Simply applying these <b>f</b> transforms to all of the images in the
stack will not help, because each section would be aligned to the previous one
only if that previous one were not itself transformed.  For example, consider
the following example of 3 sections that need to be shifted into alignment in
one dimension.  Here is a side view of the sections, where we need to align
the + marks in each section.
<pre>
 2  ---+------+-----
 1  -+------+-------
 0  ------+------+--
</pre>
The pairwise comparison of sections indicates that 1 must be shifted 5 units
to the right to align it to 0, and 2 must be shifted 2 units to the left to
align it to 1.  Performing those operations would give:
<pre>
 2 -+------+-----__    f: DX = -2
 1 _____-+------+--    f: DX = +5
 0 ------+------+--    f: DX =  0
</pre>
(Here, the underscores _ represent empty or non-existent image.)  The
misalignment here indicates that a second stage is necessary: one must obtain
the transforms for each image that will produce an aligned stack when actually
applied to the images.  This list is consistently referred to as a list of 
"<b>g</b>" transforms.  In our example, the appropriate <b>g</b> transforms produce a
proper alignment:
<pre>
 2 __---+------+---    g: DX = +2
 1 ____-+------+---    g: DX = +4
 0 -----+------+--_    g: DX = -1
</pre>
In summary, <b>f</b> transforms align each section to the preceding
one; <b>g</b> transforms align each section to the whole stack.
<P>
There are three general methods for obtaining alignment transforms:
automated search for the best fit between two images, solving for a transform
from a set of fiducial points that correspond between two sections, and manual
adjustment of transformation parameters while viewing the two sections.  The
latter methods were developed because the automated method is not usually
sufficient.

<H3><A NAME = "Automatic"></A>Automatic alignment</H3>
The Python script <A HREF = "man/xfalign.html#TOP">Xfalign</A> will do automated
alignment of a set of serial sections.  The main tool that it runs is the
program <A HREF = "man/xfsimplex.html#TOP">Xfsimplex</A>, which varies the six
transformation parameters until it finds the best "fit" between two images.
Its primary method of measuring fit is with a difference measure, which
is just the sum of the absolute values of pixel-by-pixel differences
between the two images.  This measure can lead to success if the features that
correspond between the two images are relatively large or comprise a
substantial fraction of the image area. 
Two important factors governing the success
of <A HREF = "man/xfsimplex.html#TOP">Xfsimplex</A> are: 1) appropriate
pre-processing of the images to emphasize features that correspond; 
and 2) proper choice of the
parameters for <A HREF = "man/xfsimplex.html#TOP">Xfsimplex</A>, particularly
how much to reduce the size of images in X and Y.  
See the man pages for <A HREF = "man/xfalign.html#TOP">Xfalign</A> and 
<A HREF = "man/xfsimplex.html#TOP">Xfsimplex</A> for more guidance on these points.
<A HREF = "man/xfsimplex.html#TOP">Xfsimplex</A> provides low-pass and high-pass
Fourier filtering, controlled by four parameters specifying the location and
width of Gaussian functions.  These are the same parameters used by numerous
other IMOD programs.  You can experiment with simple low- and high-pass filters
in the image processing window of <A HREF = "man/3dmod.html#TOP">3dmod</A>; the
low-frequency sigma, high-frequency cutoff and high-frequency falloff there
correspond to the sigma1, radius2, and sigma2 entries to the "-filter" option
of <A HREF = "man/xfalign.html#TOP">Xfalign</A>.  You can visualize the filter
functions for the full range of possible filters with 
<A HREF = "man/filterplot.html#TOP">Filterplot</A>; see that man page for a
description of all the effects of the parameters.  You can use the same
four parameters with <A HREF = "man/mtffilter.html#TOP">Mtffilter</A> to see how more
complicated filters treat your data.
<P>
<A HREF = "man/xfsimplex.html#TOP">Xfsimplex</A> will normally search for the
values of the six formal transformation parameters, but one can select a
mode in which it will search
for the six semi-natural parameters or selected subsets of them.  Unless one
wishes to vary only a subset of parameters (e.g. displacement only or
displacement, rotation, and uniform magnification only), the semi-natural
parameters seem to present no advantage.
<P>
In the simplest case, one would invoke <A HREF = "man/xfalign.html#TOP">Xfalign</A> with 
<pre>
    xfalign sections.st sections.xf
</pre>
which would find search for alignments between the images in "sections.st"
and output the <b>f</b> transforms into the file "sections.xf".
<P>
Because <A HREF = "man/xfsimplex.html#TOP">Xfsimplex</A> does an iterative search
for a local optimum in the fitting measure, it cannot find the right alignment
if there is a big initial
displacement between the images.  <A HREF = "man/xfalign.html#TOP">Xfalign</A> has
an option to do an initial cross-correlationusing 
<A HREF = "man/tiltxcorr.html#TOP">Tiltxcorr</A>, which
will find the displacement that gives a global optimum in the correlation
between the images.  These displacements are then
passed to <A HREF = "man/xfsimplex.html#TOP">Xfsimplex</A>, which searches with
them as a starting point.  This option can be invoked with 
<pre>
     xfalign -pr sections.st sections.xf
</pre>
Another alternative, if cross-correlations do not work well, is to run 
<A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A>
initially (see below) and use it to quickly shift the images into approximate
alignment.  <A HREF = "man/xfalign.html#TOP">Xfalign</A> can then be told to use
these initial alignments, rather than trying to find initial alignments by
correlation.  If the <b>f</b> transforms
produced by <A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A> are in the file
"sections.prexf", then this option can be invoked with
<pre>
     xfalign -in sections.prexf sections.st sections.xf
</pre>

<H3><A NAME = "Fiducial"></A>
Generating or Editing an Alignment with Fiducial Points</H3>
The program <A HREF = "man/xfmodel.html#TOP">Xfmodel</A> can solve for the
parameters of a transformation between sections from the locations of points
that are known or assumed to
correspond between the sections.  <A HREF = "man/xfmodel.html#TOP">Xfmodel</A>
works with a model of connected fiducial points built in 3dmod.  In the
simplest case, if you built a model
of fiducial points named "sections.fid", you would just enter
<pre>
     xfmodel sections.fid sections.xf
</pre>
to compute a list of <b>f</b> transforms.  By default, it will solve for the full
linear transformation, but there are also options to solve for translations
only, translations and rotations, or translations, rotations, and
magnifications.  Although it is most common to use this method to align an
entire image stack, one can also use <A HREF = "man/xfmodel.html#TOP">Xfmodel</A>
to "edit" an existing list of f
transforms.  That is, if one enters fiducial points for a subset of
troublesome sections, the program will solve for the transforms for those
sections only, and replace those transforms in the existing list.
<A HREF = "man/xfmodel.html#TOP">Xfmodel</A> can also be used to transform a model
to a new alignment (see below). 

<h3><A NAME = "Manual"></A>
Manually Editing an Alignment and Adding Warping with Midas</H3>
The program <A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A> provides for interactive
visualization and manual adjustment of the alignment between two images.  It
can be used to edit a list of <b>f</b> transforms.  By using 
<A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A>, it is not necessary to build an aligned
stack to assess the quality of transforms produced by automatic alignment.
The program will take the unaligned images, apply any existing transforms,
such as those generated by automatic or fiducial alignment, and allow the user
to manipulate each transform.  It works with the fully natural transform
parameters.  Midas can be invoked with
<pre>
     midas sections.st sections.xf
</pre>
which will load in images from "sections.st".  If "sections.xf" is an
already-existing file of <b>f</b> transforms, you can then edit the transforms in
that file; if the file does not exist, it will be defined as the output file
into which transforms will be saved.
<P>
<A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A> allows one to use a nonlinear
transformation, or warping, to align any pair of sections.  Warping becomes
important for very large images where nonlinearities make it difficult to line
them up everywhere with a single linear transformation.
Essentially, after aligning as much you wish with a linear
transformation, you select the option to add warping points.  You then add a
series of points at locations where there are features that can be aligned.
At each location, you shift the image locally into alignment.  See the section
<b>Warping Images</b> in the <A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas man page</A> for
more details.
<P>
Once you have introduced warping in <A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A>, 
the transformation files become
much more complex than the single line per section described above.  However,
all of the programs described below will read these warping transform
files interchangeably with simple linear transform files and operate
appropriately, which means that all of the operations described below work
with warping and require no special options.  Two
limitations are that a warping transform file cannot be used with the
"-initial" option to <A HREF = "man/xalign.html#TOP">Xfalign</A> or as an existing
transform file to be edited by <A HREF = "man/xfmodel.html#TOP">Xfmodel</A>.

<h3><A NAME = "FtoG2"></A>Converting from an F List to a G List</h3>
As discussed above, to get from the list of <b>f</b> transforms to a useful
stack of aligned images, one must first convert them to <b>g</b> transforms using the
program <A HREF = "man/xftoxg.html#TOP">Xftoxg</A>.  This will produce transforms
that can be used to transform each section into a common alignment.  
<A HREF = "man/xftoxg.html#TOP">Xftoxg</A> has several different ways
of doing this, depending on whether you want to preserve or eliminate trends
in the data.  The following series of examples will illustrate the treatment
of trends.  Suppose we have sections with a progressive shift of positions:
<pre>
 3  --+------+--------
 2  ---+------+-------
 1  -------+------+---
 0  --------+------+--
</pre>
To get <b>g</b> transforms that will align all of the images to a single average
position, and eliminate the progressive shift, run
<A HREF = "man/xftoxg.html#TOP">Xftoxg</A> with the option "-n 0" as follows:
<pre>
   xftoxg -n 0 sections.xf
</pre>
This entry takes advantage of a feature of 
<A HREF = "man/xftoxg.html#TOP">Xftoxg</A>: you do not have to enter
an output file name if the input file name ends in "f".  This command produces 
a file "sections.xg" of <b>g</b> transforms, which when applied to the images, would
give:
<pre>
 3  ___--+------+-----
 2  __---+------+-----
 1 ------+------+---__
 0  -----+------+--___
</pre>
This result is generally usable if there are relatively few sections and if
you do not care about the image that is lost off the edges for sections
farther away from the center of the stack.  However, if there are a large
number of sections (say, > 50), the shifts can accumulate unacceptably.  Also,
there may be cases in which the cues that are used for alignment actually
should progress across the image area through the sections.  To avoid these
problems, it is possible to have each section aligned to a "local" average
alignment based on a linear fit to trends in the transformations for the
nearby sections.  This procedure will retain the trends but align adjacent
sections as well as possible by eliminating deviations from the trends.  This
is the default mode of operation of <A HREF = "man/xftoxg.html#TOP">Xftoxg</A>, invoked by
<pre>
   xftoxg sections.xf
</pre>
and the resulting transforms in sections.xg would give:
<pre>
 3  --+------+--------
 2  _---+------+------
 1  ------+------+---_
 0  --------+------+--
</pre>
The situation is more complex if there are trends in rotation or size.
Rotation trends can occur because of curvature of the ribbon of sections, or
because of progressive rotation of the features used for alignment.  Trends in
size can easily occur when using <A HREF = "man/xfalign.html#TOP">Xfalign</A>, if
the features that govern the alignment change size progressively through the
series.  Here is a series of sections with such a size change:
<pre>
 3  --+--x--+-----------
 2  --+---x---+---------
 1  -----+----x----+----
 0  -----+-----x-----+--
</pre>
Aligning to a single central position with the "-n 0" option is clearly
inappropriate here because it squeezes the images at one end of the stack and
expands them at the other:
<pre>
 3  _---+----x----+-----
 2  __--+----x----+-----
 1  ----+----x----+----_
 0  _---+----x----+--___
</pre>
Aligning to a single central position tends to convert features of interest
into a right cylinder, regardless of their true geometry.  Again, we can avoid
this problem and retain all trends with the default entry to 
<A HREF = "man/xftoxg.html#TOP">Xftoxg</A>, with the following result:
<pre>
 3  --+--x--+-----------
 2  _--+---x---+--------
 1  ----+----x----+----_
 0  -----+-----x-----+--
</pre>
This may be an acceptable alignment, especially for very large numbers of
sections.  However, it is frequently desirable to eliminate the trend in
lateral displacements, particularly for images acquired on a CCD camera on the
microscope or digitized by a method that does not provide a good preliminary
alignment.  To handle these situation, there is a hybrid or mixed alignment 
method that will eliminate trends in position but retain trends in size.  It
is invoked by
<pre>
    xftoxg -m 2 sections.xf
</pre>
The resulting transforms applied to the sections give the desired result
and avoid distorting the sizes of the objects:
<pre>
 3  ____--+--x--+-------
 2  ___--+---x---+------
 1  ----+----x----+----_
 0  ---+-----x-----+--__
</pre>
If you use hybrid alignments, you need to decide whether to eliminate or
retain any trends in rotation.  Rotations are probably artifactual and should
be eliminated if they are simply due to rotation of images during acquisition
or digitization.  However, automatic alignment with Xfalign may be dominated
by features that actually rotate within the volume, in which case rotation
trends should be preserved.  For example, a tightly packed bundle of
microtubules may have a twist, and if these microtubules dominate the
alignment, the alignment will contain a progressive rotation that should be
preserved.  Use the "-m 2" option to retain rotation trends or "-m 3" to
eliminate them.

<h3><A NAME = "Images"></A>Creating Transformed Images</h3>
Given a list of <b>g</b> transforms, the program 
<A HREF = "man/newstack.html#TOP">Newstack</A> will transform the
images to create an aligned stack.  This program can also "float" the images
to have a common range or mean of intensity, change the size of the images, or
extract a portion of the images.  See the man page for 
<A HREF = "man/newstack.html#TOP">Newstack</A> for more information or enter
"newstack -h". A simple example, which will float the images to the same mean
intensity and contrast, is
<pre>
    newstack -xf sections.xg -fl 2 sections.st sections.ali
</pre>
Here, "sections.xg" is your file of <b>g</b> transforms produced by 
<A HREF = "man/xftoxg.html#TOP">Xftoxg</A>, "-fl 2"
specifies floating to mean, "sections.st" is your input stack of unaligned
images, and "sections.ali" is your output stack of aligned images.

<h3><A NAME = "Montages"></A>Working with Montaged Images</h3>
If you have serial images each consisting of a montage of overlapping
frames, as can be acquired with SerialEM, then you need to follow different
procedures for getting an initial stack to align, and for getting an aligned
stack.  The first step is to extract a text file with a list of the X, Y, and
Z coordinates for each frame, called a piece list.  Do this with
<pre>
    extractpieces sections.st sections.pl
</pre>
<P>
Next, get a copy of a command file for running the program 
<A HREF = "man/blendmont.html#TOP">Blendmont</A>, which
can analyze the overlapping image area between adjacent frames and compose a
single image for each section.  Do:
<pre>
    cp $IMOD_DIR/com/sloppyblend.com .
</pre>
<P>
Edit this file, replacing "g5a" with the root name of your data file
("sections", in our example here).  If you acquired the montage with stage
shifts instead of image shift, you should change the entry "SloppyMontage" to
"VerySloppyMontage".  Now run the program by entering:
<pre>
    subm sloppyblend
</pre>
<P>
<A HREF = "man/blendmont.html#TOP">Blendmont</A> will run in the background, and a
message will be printed when it finishes. The output file is named
sections.bl.  Open this in <A HREF = "man/3dmod.html#TOP">3dmod</A> and see if the
frames appear to have fused properly.  Also, unless you have a 1 by n or n by 1
montage, examine the log from <A HREF = "man/blendmont.html#TOP">Blendmont</A>, in
the file sloppyblend.log:
<pre>
    less sloppyblend.log
</pre>
For each section, you will see a line like
<pre>
 8 edges, mean&max error before:  25.22  88.08, after by edges:   1.24   3.06
</pre>
The two numbers on the right are the ones that indicate whether the pieces
line up well after being shifting into registration as well as possible.  If
these numbers are large (more than a few pixels), it is likely that one or
more of the correlations used to align adjacent pieces in that section has
failed.  If this seems to have happened, then open the file in Midas in order
to fix the alignment between pieces:
<pre>
    midas -b 0  -p sections.pl sections.st sections.ecd 
</pre>
<P>
In <A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A>, you can go to each troublesome
section and examine each of the overlap zones, adjusting the ones where the
pieces do not line up.  See the
section "Fixing Montage Overlaps" in the <A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A>
man page.  (Beware: sections are numbered from zero in sloppyblend.log but
from 1 in <A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A>.)  After fixing
overlaps, save the shifts (this saves a new copy of sections.ecd).  Then edit
sloppyblend.com and change the 0 to a 1 on the line "ReadInXcorrs".  Rerun
the program with subm.
<P>
Once you have a blended stack, you can use the same procedures on it that 
were described above with sections.st to align the stack.  Once you have a set
of <b>g</b> transforms, edit slopyblend.com again to apply these transforms to the
original stack in the blending operations.  To do this,
<OL>
<LI> change the name on
the ImageOutputFile line from ".bl" to ".ali"
<LI> remove the "#" before
"TransformFile"
<LI> change "g5a.xf" on that line to the name of your g
transform file ("sections.xg").  Then rerun sloppyblend, and you will get an
aligned stack.
</OL>

<H3><A NAME = "Realigning"></A>Realigning Images and Models</H3>
Sometimes one will find after modeling on a set of images that the
alignment needs to be improved.  There are several tools that can be used to
get a better alignment.  The operations to run depend first on whether you
are going to go back to the original data or operate on the aligned data.
<P>
1) You can go back to the original data and modify the <b>f</b> transforms, or
rerun <A HREF = "man/xtftoxg.html#TOP">Xtftoxg</A> with different parameters to
get different <b>g</b> transforms. First make a copy of the xf file:
<pre>
    cp sections.xf sections.newxf
</pre>
If you want to fix <b>f</b> transforms, you would probably do this by running 
<A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A> on the raw stack:
<pre>
    midas sections.st sections.newxf
</pre>
After adjusting the alignment or not, you would rerun 
<A HREF = "man/xftoxg.html#TOP">Xftoxg</A> (using whatever
parameters you used before, or new ones if appropriate), for example:
<pre>
    xftoxg sections.newxf
</pre>
This will give you a new file of <b>g</b> transforms, "sections.newxg".  Making a
new aligned stack it easy; just rerun the newstack command with this new file
instead of the old "xg" file.  To transform a model into alignment with these
images, run
<pre>
    xfmodel -pre sections.xg -xf sections.newxg sections.mod sections.newmod
</pre>
The "-pre" argument tells <A HREF = "man/xfmodel.html#TOP">Xfmodel</A> to
back-transform the model by the old <b>g</b> transforms, which aligns it to the raw
images, before transforming it by the
new transforms.
<P>
2) Suppose you work from the already aligned images or a model on them, and
derive a set of <b>f</b> transforms that would improve their alignment, in the file
"sections.xf2". These need to be converted to <b>g</b> transforms, but then
transforming the model is easy:
<pre>
    xftoxg sections.xf2 sections.xg2
    xfmodel -xf sections.xg2 sections.mod sections.newmod
</pre>
However, to get a new aligned stack, you should go back to the raw stack
instead of applying a second transformation to the aligned stack, in order to
avoid interpolating the data any more times than you have to (each
interpolation step potentially degrades the images).  To do this,
you need to multiply the first and second set of <b>g</b> transforms and apply the
product:
<pre>
    xfproduct sections.xg sections.xg2 sections.prod
    newstack -xf sections.prod sections.st sections.newali
</pre>
If you have a montage, instead of running 
<A HREF = "man/newstack.html#TOP">Newstack</A>, edit
sloppyblend.com to change "sections.xg" to "sections.prod" and rerun 
<A HREF = "man/blendmont.html#TOP">Blendmont</A>.
<P>
There are several ways that you could work from an existing model to get
a refined alignment.  One way is to take Tiff snapshots of the Zap window in
<A HREF = "man/3dmod.html#TOP">3dmod</A> through the entire set of sections, with
either the model displayed on the images or just the model showing on a black
background.  (You can take such snapshots automatically with the Edit-Movies
dialog box.)  Stack the Tiff files into a single color MRC file:
<pre>
    tif2mrc zap*.tif zapstack.mrc
</pre>
<A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A> can read this file and display the colors
in gray scale, allowing you to adjust the alignment based on model features:
<pre>
    midas zapstack.mrc sections.xf2
</pre>
<P>
An existing model can also be used to provide a new fiducial alignment,
provided that it has features that have been modeled across the sections.
For example,
<pre>
    xfmodel sections.mod sections.xf2
</pre>
There is a script, <A HREF = "man/selfalign.html#TOP">Selfalign</A>, that will do
this operation as well as realign the model, producing new <b>f</b> transforms in a
".selfxf" file, new <b>g</b> transforms in a ".selfxg" file, and a new model ending
in ".selfmod".  Aside from convenience, the script has the advantage that it
can be given a limited number of sections over which to find the alignment,
and it will properly handle the transitions between the regions being
realigned and those being left as they were.

<H3><A NAME = "Handedness"></A>Stacking Order and Handedness of Structures</H3>
The order in which your images are stacked affects whether structures in your
reconstruction have the correct handedness.  Handedness matters if you are
reconstructing structures such as microtubule bundles that may twist,
axonemes, or basal bodies.  Note that as sections come off of the block, they
represent slices from the top down, when viewing the block face from the outside.
Assuming that sections do not get flipped before being loaded onto a grid, the
top side of each section faces up and the bottom is against the grid.
Handedness will be preserved if the images of the sections represent views
from the top of the sections, and if the volume is stacked in order from
bottom (deeper in the block) to top.  More generally,
the handedness of a serial section reconstruction
depends on the product of a sequence of factors, each of which you should be
able to control or assess:
<UL>
<LI> Whether the grid is loaded into the rod with the sections facing up (+1)
  or down (-1).
<LI> Whether the rod is turned upside down (-1) or stays upright (+1) when
  inserted into the microscope.
<LI> Whether images are inverted (-1) or not (+1) between the specimen plane
  and the camera.  Images are inverted in some JEOL microscopes with omega
  filters.  Images may be inverted relative to what appears on the viewing
  screen by the CCD camera software.
<LI> Whether you acquire images in order from first to last one cut (from
  top to bottom, -1) or in inverse order (from bottom to top, +1).
<LI> Whether images are stacked in the order they are acquired (+1) or in the
  inverse order (-1).  The first and last sections in the stack are at the
  bottom and top of the volume, respectively, when it is viewed from the
  high-Z side, which is the way in which images are viewed in the Zap window.

If you find that the handedness of your stack is wrong, the simplest way to
get a stack with the right handedness is with
