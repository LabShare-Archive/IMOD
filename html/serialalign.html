This document provides a step-by-step guide for using the interface in eTomo
for aligning images from serial sections.
It also presents some background information on the
concepts and tools involved in this process, and describes some of the
other operations that can be run outside of the eTomo interface.
This interface is also useful if you have some montaged images that need to be
blended into single frames without any alignment; in that case you just need
to go through <A HREF = "#Starting">Getting Started</A> and 
<A HREF = "#Blending">Blending Montaged Images</A>.
<P>
Most images can be aligned adequately by applying general linear
transformations (also known as affine transformations).  These transformations
can include a shift, a rotation, a magnification (size change), and a stretch,
all of which occur uniformly across an image.  See 
<A HREF = "#Linear">Background on Linear Transformations</A> for more details
about the properties of these transforms and the terminology that we use.
When the changes between
two images are nonlinear (e.g., if distortions occurs differently in different
areas), then it is necessary to use a nonlinear or warping transformation to
align them.  Warping transformations in IMOD are specified by a set of
shifts between images at a collection of points.  The interface supports two
different methods of
aligning images: automatically by image correlations with 
<A HREF = "man/Xfalign.html#TOP">Xfalign</A>, or manually by displaying pairs of
images in <A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A>.  A third method of
aligning with linear transformations, fiducial points marked between images,
is not supported by the interface and is described in 
<A HREF = "#Fiducial">Generating or Editing an Alignment with Fiducial 
  Points</A>.  Other operations not supported by the interface,
  refining the alignment after you have created a model on the aligned stack
  and transforming the model to that new alignment, are described in 
<A HREF = "#Realigning">Realigning Images and Models</A>.
<P>
If you are working with serial sections, you should also consider the issues
discussed in <A HREF = "#Handedness">Stacking Order and Handedness of Structures</A>.
<P>
The interface has several features to alleviate the difficulties of dealing
with very large images.  For any button that opens an image file in
<A HREF = "man/3dmod.html#TOP">3dmod</A>, you
can right click and select either <B>Open binned by 2</B> or 
<B>Open with startup window</B>.  The latter allows you to select a
higher binning in X and Y, and even binning in Z if that would be
appropriate.  You can make one of these two choices be the default when
opening <A HREF = "man/3dmod.html#TOP">3dmod</A> by selecting the same option
in the eTomo Options menu. There is also an option on the Align tab to load
data into <A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A> with binning, which will
save memory, make the program run faster, and may make the images look better
than full-sized images zoomed down.

<H3><A NAME = "Starting"></A>Getting Started</H3>
The images that you want to align need to be in a single MRC file, referred to as
a stack.  If your images are in one section per file, then they can be stacked
with <A HREF = "man/newstack.html#TOP">Newstack</A> (if they are already in
MRC format), <A HREF = "man/tif2mrc.html#TOP">Tif2mrc</A> (if they are TIFF
files), or possibly <A HREF = "man/raw2mrc.html#TOP">Raw2mrc</A> (for some
other file formats).  See the <A HREF = "guide.html#GettingStarted">IMOD
  Guide</A> for details on stacking files.  Color (RGB) images can also be
aligned with these procedures; <A HREF = "man/tif2mrc.html#TOP">Tif2mrc</A>
will make an RGB-mode MRC file by default when given color images.
<P>
Your unaligned image stack may have any extension: ".st", ".mrc", or anything
else.  The root name of this stack (before the extension) is used as the dataset
name (referred to as "setname") from which other files are named.
<P>
Only one serial section data set can reside in a directory, so generally you
should start by creating a directory and moving the raw stack into it.  If you
are just blending montages and want to blend one after another in the same
directory, you need to remove the ".ess" file that eTomo uses to keep track of
serial section data sets.
<P>
Start eTomo.  The Front Page will appear; press the button <B>Align Serial
    Sections / Blend Montages</B>.  This will open both the main eTomo window
    and a starting dialog titled "Starting Serial Sections" where you
    select the unaligned image stack and indicate whether it consists
    of <B>Single frames</B> or <B>Montages</B>.  The Log window also appears; 
    messages are copied there and you can also enter notes there.
<P>
This dialog also has a place
    to select an image distortion field file, which can be helpful when
    blending montages taken with side-entry (wide-angle) cameras.  There are
    tools in IMOD for computing such image distortion fields from a set of
    overlapping images at a particular magnification.  The file
    chooser will open in the directory where such files should be kept 
(<code>/usr/local/ImodCalib/Distortion</code> by default).  If you select a
    distortion file, be sure to set the binning on the camera at which the
    images were acquired.

<H3><A NAME = "Blending"></A>Blending Montaged Images</H3>
<P>
If you have a montaged image stack, the interface opens with the <B>Initial
Blend</B> tab after you finish with the starting dialog.  It will first
extract the piece list file from the image file if one is not already present
(named "setname.pl").  The progress area at the top of the window will
indicate that this has happened. The alignment tools work only with
single-frame images, so it is necessary to run 
<A HREF = "man/blendmont.html#TOP">Blendmont</A> to create the needed images
in a file named "setname_blend.mrc".  This program uses correlations in
overlap zones to determine the shift in X and Y between each pair of
horizontally or vertically adjacent montage pieces. It takes all of these
shifts into account to solve for a shift to be applied to each individual
piece when placing it in the blended image.
<P>
Select
<B>Treat as very sloppy montage</B> if the montage was acquired with stage
movement.  With this option, the program will correlate larger portions of the
overlap zones and be able to find the shifts when the overlap varies
substantially from the nominal amount.
<P>
The option for <B>Robust fitting</B> is useful if a minor fraction of the
correlations in the overlap zones fail because of grid bars, insufficient
image features, or inadequate overlap.  This is rare with serial section data
but common when blending montages used for mapping in SerialEM.  With robust
fitting, the program can give less weight to correlation shifts that have
larger errors when solving for the overall shifts of the individual pieces.
In the best case, the erroneous correlation shifts may be completely
discounted and the correct solution obtained from the rest of the
data.  The criterion entered in the text box controls the sensitivity for
considering a shift to be an outlier; a value smaller than 1 will down-weight
more shifts.
<P>
Press <B>Make Blended Stack</B> to run  
<A HREF = "man/blendmont.html#TOP">Blendmont</A>.  Press <B>Open Blended Stack</B>
to see the resulting blended file.
If the shifts between pieces were not all determined
accurately, you may be able to see this in the blended file.  However, it can be
difficult to see this problem in the unaligned images, so you may not see a
problem until you make an aligned stack.  The log file from the blending run
does have useful information about the errors in aligning the pieces, unless
you have a montage that consists of just one row or one column of pieces.
Thus, except in that case, you should open the "preblend.log" to examine the
errors in aligning pieces. (Right-click in
the panel and select this file from the popup menu.)
For each section, you will see a line like
<pre>
 8 edges, mean&max error before:  25.22  88.08, after by edges:   1.24   3.06
</pre>
The two numbers on the right are the ones that indicate whether the pieces
line up well after being shifting into registration as well as possible.  If
these numbers are large (more than a few pixels), it is likely that one or
more of the correlations used to align adjacent pieces in that section has
failed.  It is hard to give a fixed rule for when the numbers are too large,
because when there are no errors in the correlations, the errors shown will
depend on the amount and kind of distortion in your images.  Until you have
some experience about what size of errors to expect, you should open the
data set in <A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A> and verify the alignment
of pieces in a few of the sections with the biggest errors.
Beware: sections are numbered from zero in this log file but from
1 in <A HREF = "man/3dmod.html#TOP">3dmod</A> and 
<A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A>.
<P>
If there is a problem with the alignment of pieces, you can
use <A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A> to adjust the
shifts between pieces ("Fix edges") manually until the error in solving for
the overall shifts of the pieces is minimal.  
<A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A> will display an overlap zone between
two pieces.  Here and elsewhere, 
the overlap zones are referred to as "edges"; edges between horizontally or
vertically adjacent pieces are referred to as edges in X or Y, respectively.
You can use the spin boxes or the hot keys to go between one edge and the next
or one section and the next (the hot keys are "a" and "b" to move between
sections and "A" and "B" to move between edges).  Basically, you need to find
each bad displacement and adjust it by shifting with the left mouse button.
The buttons in the lower left showing the largest errors will assist in
finding the bad shifts on a section.  If the shift is bad, you can try the 
<B>Apply Leave-out Error</B> button near the bottom, as this will often place
the piece correctly based on its overlap with other pieces.
There are several other features to assist in this task when there are many
errors (which can be the case when fixing shifts for a low-magnification
map).  See <A HREF = "midasHelp/controls.html#Controls">Controls when Fixing Montages</A> 
in the <A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A> online
help and the section on <B>Fixing Montage Overlaps</B> in the 
<A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas man page</A>.
<P>
After fixing edges, you need to save the shifts, exit 
<A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A>, and remake the blended stack.

<H3><A NAME = "Aligning"></A>Aligning the Serial Sections with Linear Transformations</H3>
On the <B>Align</B> tab in the eTomo interface, you can do both automated alignment with 
<A HREF = "man/xfalign.html#TOP">Xfalign</A> and manual alignment with 
<A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A>.  Nearly all of the controls are for
automated alignment; if you just want to do manual alignment then you only
need to press the <B>Midas</B> button.  The automated alignment works only if
there are sufficient image features that are similar from one section to the
next.  For a substantial number of
sections, or a project with numerous similar data sets, it is worth trying the
automated alignment and experimenting with parameters to see if it can be made
to work.  The primary program run by 
<A HREF = "man/xfalign.html#TOP">Xfalign</A> is 
<A HREF = "man/xfsimplex.html#TOP">Xfsimplex</A>, which performs an iterative search for
the transformation parameters that minimize a measure of difference between
two images.  With the radio butttons, you can choose whether it finds 
the <B>Full linear transformation</B>, or a restricted
transformation consisting of </B>Rotation/translation</B> or
</B>Rotation/translation/magnification</B> (size change).  The search starts
with no shift between images (at least, when you start it with 
<B>Initial Auto Alignment</B>) and it can get stuck in a local minimum and not
find the alignment if the images have a substantial shift between them.  
Thus, if you observe big shifts between the images when you open the unaligned
stack, you should
turn on the option <B>Find initial shifts with cross-correlation</B>,
which will make <A HREF = "man/xfalign.html#TOP">Xfalign</A> run 
<A HREF = "man/tiltxcorr.html#TOP">Tiltxcorr</A> first to correlate the images
at all possible shifts and find the best one.
By turning off the <B>Search For</B> checkbox, it is also possible to
find just the shifts by cross-correlation and skip the search in 
<A HREF = "man/xfsimplex.html#TOP">Xfsimplex</A>.
<P>
The automatic alignment should work better if images are processed to
emphasize corresponding features.  The processing and area selection options
available through the
interface consist of the <B>Fraction to ignore on edges</B>, the
image <B>Binning in search</B> (which is 2 by default) and low and high pass filtering
by Gaussian functions.  The binning selection here applies only to the search
in <A HREF = "man/xfsimplex.html#TOP">Xfsimplex</A> and should be set to bring
the images down to about 1K in size or less.  This binning is actually done
with antialiased image reduction to avoid having high-frequency information
aliased into the reduced image in ways that might degrade the signal for
aligning the images.  Thus, there is no need to use the
Gaussian filtering just
to avoid the effects of aliasing when using a high binning.  You can avoid
the filtering by blanking out each of the three parameter fields.
<P>
The three filter parameters, the
sigma for a low-frequency filter and the cutoff radius and sigma for a
high-frequency filter, have the same meaning as the parameters used in many other IMOD
programs.  This filter is applied to the reduced image.  You can experiment
with these 
filter settings by loading the stack into 
<A HREF = "man/3dmod.html#TOP">3dmod</A> with a binning corresponding to
the <B>Binning in search</B> (right click on the <B>Open Stack</B> button and
select <B>Open with startup window</B>, and enter the appropriate binning in
X/Y).  Then open the Fourier Filtering
panel of the 
<A HREF = "3dmodHelp/imageProc.html#FourierFilter">3dmod Image Processing</A>
dialog by selecting <B>Image-Process</B> from
the <B>Edit</B> menu and clicking on <B>Fourier filter</B>.
<A HREF = "man/xfalign.html#TOP">Xfalign</A> has several other
options for image filtering that are not available through the interface, and
you would have to run the program outside of eTomo to access those options.
See the man pages for  <A HREF = "man/xfalign.html#TOP">Xfalign</A> and
 <A HREF = "man/xfsimplex.html#TOP">Xfsimplex</A> for more guidance on
 processing options; let us know if you think other options should be added to
 the interface.
<P>
You can skip over sections with features that will impair alignment by listing
them in <B>Sections to skip</B>, with sections numbered from 1.  The programs
will align the section after a skipped one to a section before a skipped one.
Note that if you then align the skipped sections manually, you will need to
align both the skipped section to the previous one and the next one to the
skipped one.
<P> To run automatic alignment when there is no preliminary alignment of
  images, press <B>Initial Auto Autoalignment</B>.  You can then examine how
  well the alignment worked in <A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A>, as
  described in the next section.

<h3><A NAME = "Manual"></A> Manually Editing an Alignment</H3>
The program <A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A> provides for interactive
visualization and manual adjustment of the alignment between two images.  Like
automatic alignment, it works with a list of transformations that relate each
section to the previous one.  It can be used exclusively for alignment, or it
can be used to assess the quality of transforms produced by automatic
alignment and adjust them as needed, without having to build an aligned stack.
The program works with the unaligned images and applies a transform to one of
them to show how two images are aligned.
<P>
Here are a few key points about using 
<A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A> to align images with a linear
transformation:
<UL>
<LI> The program always considers one pair of images at a time.  The hot keys
  "a" and "b" advance and back up the pair of sections being viewed.
<LI> The program starts out in green-magenta overlay, where the section being
  aligned, referred to as the "current section", is in green, and the previous
  one, the "reference section", is in magenta.  Toggling between images is
  often more useful and can be done with the <B>Toggle Ref/Cur</B> button or 
  the "PageUp" and "PageDown" keys.  The <B>Overlay view</B> checkbox or the
  "Insert" key will restore the color overlay.
<LI> Aligning is generally done with the mouse.  In the middle of the panel on
  the left are three lines in red and blue showing what each mouse button
  does with different control keys pressed; the line in red shows what actions
  are currently available.
<LI> Shifting, rotating, and changing magnification with the mouse are
  relatively straightforward (left button, middle button, and right button
  with "Shift" key, respectively).  
<LI> Stretching the image with the right mouse button is seemingly
  intuitive, but it takes some experience to know what stretch is needed to
  fix a particular misalignment.  To make this easier, there are two other
  ways to impose a stretch.  
<LI> A second way to impose stretch involves aligning the image at two points:
  the yellow "center" point, which you may need to move with the Ctrl and the
  middle mouse button; and a "second fixed point", which you set at an aligned
  place with Ctrl and the right mouse button.  Then you drag the image at another
  location until the images line up as well as possible.
<LI> The third way is equivalent to the second but may seem easier: turn
  on <B>Add/edit warp points</B>, add three well-spaced points at places where
  the images can be aligned, and shift the images into alignment at each
  point.  As long as you do not exceed 3 points, you still have a linear
  transformation.  The middle mouse button adds a point, and the left mouse
  button can be used to drag the currently selected point, which is shown in
  yellow.  A different point can be selected by clicking it with the left
  mouse button.
<LI> The Edit menu has entries for resetting the transform to the "unit"
  transform or to a previously saved one.
<LI> Use the "S" hot key to save the transforms before exiting.
</UL>

<h3><A NAME = "UsingBoth"></A>Combining Automatic and Manual Alignment</H3>
The action buttons at the bottom of the alignment panel provide for several
alternative strategies and do not all need to be used.  Possibilities are:
<UL>
<LI> Use <B>Midas</B> only.
<LI> Use <B>Initial Auto Alignment</B> followed by <B>Midas</B>.
<LI> Use <B>Midas</B> to get images roughly aligned, followed by <B>Refine
    with Auto Alignment</B>, then <B>Midas</B> to check the result.
<LI> Use <B>Initial Auto Alignment</B> to find a restricted set of parameters, 
check and fix the result with <B>Midas</B>, then use  <B>Refine
    with Auto Alignment</B> with less restricted parameters and check again
      with  <B>Midas</B>.
</UL>
<P> The program keeps track of the last alignment done and uses that as the
  basis for the next operation.  However, if you run an initial autoalignment
  and the results are bad enough that you want to start from scratch and align
  just with <A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A>, you can press 
  <B>Revert to No Transforms</B> then <B>Midas</B>.  If you do some alignment
  in <A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A> then do a refining autoalignment
  that produces results not worth working from, you can press 
<B>Revert Auto Alignment to Midas</B> to restore the transforms that were
saved from <A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A>. 
  
<h3><A NAME = "Warping"></A>Aligning Images with Warping</H3>
<P>
A warping (nonlinear) transformation is specified by a set of shifts between
the images at particular points, which are commonly referred to as control
points.  Warping becomes
important for very large images where nonlinearities make it difficult to line
them up everywhere with a single linear transformation.  Although a warping
can be set up with as few as 4 points, in practice
you will generally need more than this minimum in order to align two images 
properly over their whole area.  Thus, warping requires more image features
that obviously correspond between images than does a linear transformation.
Warping can be introduced either manually or
automatically.  Because of the requirement for well-distributed image
features suitable for correlation, the automatic warping will work on an even
smaller subset of data sets than automatic searches for linear
transformations.  However, it is likely to work with data sets based on serial
block face imaging. 
<P>
To compute a warping automatically, select <B>Find warping
transformations</B>, which will enable all of the related fields.  
<UL>
<LI> Enter
sizes in X and Y in the fields for <B>Correlation patch size</B>; these
  should be large values (even more than 500) for images with relatively few
  features, but can be small if the images are feature-rich.  Patches will be
  set up on a regular grid, overlapping by 33%.
<LI>If the images contain areas not suitable for correlation, the best way to
  deal with this is with a boundary model.  Check <B>Use boundary model</B>
and press <B>Create/View Boundary Model</B> to make the model.  Draw one or
  more contours around the areas suitable for correlation.  If this area
  changes, draw them on multiple sections as needed to capture the change in
  area.  See the BOUNDARY CONTOURS section of the
  <A HREF = "man/tiltxcorr.html#TOP">Tiltxcorr man page</A> for more
  guidance.
<LI> It is also possible to limit the shift at each patch, so that wild
  shifts from a strong correlation peak in the wrong place will be rejected.
  To do so, enter values for the maximum shifts in X and Y in the fields for
  <B>Limit to shift</B>.  If there is no correlation peak with the limits, a
  warp point will not be added.
</UL>
<P>
After computing warping transformations, you can open the result in 
<A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A> for examination and adjustment, just
as you can for linear transformations.  If there are some aberrant shifts that
need fixing, you can navigate to them with the <B>Biggest Warp</B> button at
the bottom of the controls, and select points with the next higher or lower
shift with the adjacent up and down arrow buttons.  As mentioned above,
clicking with the left mouse button selects the nearest point and dragging
with it adjusts the shift for the current point.  There is a hot key, "D", for
deleting the current point.
<BR>
<P>
To add warping in <A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A>, select the
option <B>Add/edit warp points</B> after aligning as much you wish with a
linear transformation.  Then add a series of points at locations where there
are features that can be aligned, using the middle mouse button. The new point
will be the active one, shown in yellow, and the yellow box around it shows
the area that would be used if you press <B>Cross-correlate</B>.  At each
location, you shift the image locally into alignment with the left mouse
button.  Start by adding points where the images are already
aligned, then add points where shifts are needed. See the section 
<b>Warping Images</b> in the <A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas man page</A>
for more details.  
<P>
You can find warping automatically in conjunction with either an initial
alignment search or a search to refine an existing alignment.  However,
you cannot use <B>Refine with Auto Alignment</B> once you have a warping
alignment.  If you run an initial autoalignment with warping and it runs
into problems with getting the initial shifts or linear
transformations, then the best approach is to rerun the initial search
without the warping.  Use <A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A>
to fix any problems from that search.  Then use <B>Refine with Auto
    Alignment</B> to add the warping, omitting the linear search by turning
off <B>Search For</B>.

<h3><A NAME = "Images"></A>Creating the Aligned Stack</H3>
<P>
Once you have satisfactory transforms for aligning the images, go to the 
<B>Make Stack</B> tab to make a stack of aligned images.  Up until now, you
have been working with transforms that align an image to the previous one, and
these need to be converted to 
transforms that will bring every section into a common, global alignment
(see <A HREF = "#FandG">Background on F and G Transforms</A> for more explanation of this
point).  Pressing
<B>Make Aligned Stack</B> runs two programs, first 
<A HREF = "man/xftoxg.html#TOP">Xftoxg</A> to convert the 
transforms, then either
<A HREF = "man/newstack.html#TOP">Newstack</A> or
<A HREF = "man/blendmont.html#TOP">Blendmont</A> to apply the transforms to the images.
The options at the top, in the <B>Stack alignment transforms</B> box, control how 
<A HREF = "man/xftoxg.html#TOP">Xftoxg</A> works.  Most of the time, the
default choice of <B>Local fitting (retain trends)</B> is appropriate.  What
"retain trends" means is that if the structures dominating the alignment
persistently shift or rotate in one direction, they will still do so in the
aligned stack, only more smoothly.  See the section on 
><A HREF = "#FtoG">Converting from an F List to a G List</A> for a detailed 
explanation of the
effects of these different choices and when you might need them.  Global
alignments are generally not suitable except for relatively small numbers of
sections, especially if there are warping transformations. If you do use
this choice, there is an option to pick one section as a reference; it will
not be modified, and all other images will be aligned to it.
<P>
One consequence of the linear fitting is that the
originally captured image area will be nearly all present in the output
images.
If for some reason you do want to remove
the trends with one of the other choices, and the trends include shifts, then
you would need a
larger size to retain all of the aligned image.  Thus there are two sets of
fields to control the output, ones for the size in X and Y, and ones for a
shift in X and Y, where positive numbers shift images up and to the right.
You can enter a number in one field and leave the other blank.  These entries
are all in unbinned coordinates.  Thus, if you make a stack with binning in
order to work out the size and shift needed, you need to multiply the numbers
that you see in <A HREF = "man/3dmod.html#TOP">3dmod</A> by the binning, but
once you have the right numbers, they can be used to make an unbinned stack.
<P>
If you have a very large aligned image file, there are tools in IMOD that make
it easier to deal with such files in <A HREF = "man/3dmod.html#TOP">3dmod</A>.
Specifically, you can make an "image pyramid", a set of files at different
resolutions, using the command-line program 
<A HREF = "man/makepyramid.html#TOP">Makepyramid</A>, which allows relatively fast
access to the image data in <A HREF = "man/3dmod.html#TOP">3dmod</A>
without needing huge amounts of memory.

<H3><A NAME = "Handedness"></A>Stacking Order and Handedness of Structures</H3>
The order in which your images are stacked affects whether structures in your
reconstruction have the correct handedness.  Handedness matters if you are
reconstructing structures such as microtubule bundles that may twist,
axonemes, or basal bodies.  Note that as sections come off of the block, they
represent slices from the top down, when viewing the block face from the outside.
Assuming that sections do not get flipped before being loaded onto a grid, the
top side of each section faces up and the bottom is against the grid.
Handedness will be preserved if the images of the sections represent views
from the top of the sections, and if the volume is stacked in order from
bottom (deeper in the block) to top.  More generally,
the handedness of a transmission EM serial section reconstruction
depends on the product of a sequence of factors, each of which you should be
able to control or assess:
<UL>
<LI> Whether the grid is loaded into the rod with the sections facing up (+1)
  or down (-1).
<LI> Whether the rod is turned upside down (-1) or stays upright (+1) when
  inserted into the microscope.
<LI> Whether images are inverted (-1) or not (+1) between the specimen plane
  and the camera.  Images are inverted in some JEOL microscopes with omega
  filters.  Images may be inverted relative to what appears on the viewing
  screen by the CCD camera software.
<LI> Whether you acquire images in order from first to last one cut (+1)
  or in inverse order (-1).  Note that
  when the block face is trimmed to a trapezoid, the short edge of the
  trapezoid for a section abuts the long edge for the next section cut.
<LI> Whether images are stacked in the order they are acquired (-1) or in the
  inverse order (+1).  This inversion is counter-intuitive.  It occurs because
  the first and last sections in the stack are at the
  bottom and top of the image volume, respectively, when it is viewed from the
  high-Z side, which is the way in which images are viewed in the Zap window.
  Yet if the first section is in fact the first one cut, it is from the
  top of the physical volume, and the top of the volume should end up at high Z,
  not low Z.
</UL>
If you find that the handedness of your stack is wrong, the simplest way to
get a stack with the right handedness is with
<pre>
     clip flipz input_file output_file
</pre>
<P>
For serial block-face imaging with scanning EM, the handedness depends on two factors:
<UL>
<LI> Whether the acquired images are inverted (-1) or not (+1) relative to the
  actual appearance of the block face when viewed from the outside.
<LI> Whether the images are stacked in the order in which they are acquired
  (-1) or in inverted order (1), for the same reasons as with transmission EM.
</UL>
Yes, if the images are not inverted and they are stacked in order,
handedness <I>will</I> be inverted.  The programs
<A HREF = "man/tif2mrc.html#TOP">Tif2mrc</A>,
<A HREF = "man/dm2mrc.html#TOP">Dm2mrc</A>, and 
<A HREF = "man/raw2mrc.html#TOP">Raw2mrc</A> all have an option "-i" to stack
images in inverted order, specifically in order to preserve handedness when
converting these kind of data to MRC files.

<H3><A NAME = "Linear"></A>Background on Linear Transformations</H3>
<P>
Two images can be aligned by applying a coordinate transformation to
one image to make the transformed image match the other image as well as
possible.  The transformations used for alignment are general linear
transformations.  This means that the same amount of translation, rotation or
distortion happens everywhere in an image.  Our programs use three different
ways of representing transformations.  The parameters in these different
representations are referred to as "formal", "semi-natural", or "natural".
<P>
The formal parameters are the matrix coefficients that are actually used
to transform image coordinates.  There are six formal parameters in a linear
transformation: the new X-coordinate of a point is a linear combination of its
old X and Y coordinates, plus a constant offset, so three parameters determine
the new X-coordinate; similarly, the other 3 parameters determine the new
Y-coordinate.  The equations are
<pre>
     X' = A11 * (X - Xcen) + A12 * (Y - Ycen) + DX + Xcen
     Y' = A21 * (X - Xcen) + A22 * (Y - Ycen) + DY + Ycen
</pre>
where <code>Xcen</code> and <code>Ycen</code> are the center coordinates of
the image, so that rotation and scaling occurs about this center.
<P>
For example, if the image is rotated by some angle theta, A11 and A22 are
cos(theta), and A21 and A12 are sin(theta) and -sin(theta).  In general, the
DX and DY correspond to X and Y displacements of the image after the rotations
and distortions specified by the A matrix.  The disadvantage of the formal
parameters is that the geometrical changes in the image (rotation, size
change, and stretch) are all mixed together in the four matrix parameters.
This makes the transformation hard to interpret intuitively, and also prevents
programs from treating different kinds of changes in different ways.
<P>
The semi-natural parameters partly alleviate these difficulties by
expressing the A matrix in terms of a global rotation, a global magnification,
a difference between the rotation of the X and Y axes, and a difference
between the stretches along the X and Y axes.  This is done quite easily
because two of the parameters (A11 and A21) specify how a unit vector along
the X-axis is transformed, which directly indicates how much the X-axis is
rotated and stretched by the transformation.  Similarly, the other two matrix
parameters (A12 and A22) indicate how much the Y-axis is rotated and
stretched.  The global rotation is the average of the two axis rotations, and
the global magnification is the average of the two stretches.  Although the
stretch is not expressed very intuitively, the effects of the different
changes have been separated out in the semi-natural parameters, so they are
used by programs that need to treat the different changes differently.
<P>
The natural parameters are the most intuitive ones: global rotation,
global magnification, and stretch along an axis at a particular angle.  These
still constitute four parameters because stretch amount and stretch axis angle
are two separate parameters.  One can directly convert these four natural
parameters into an A matrix with equations that involve lots of sines and
cosines.  Given an A matrix, it is also possible (but even more complex) to
solve for the corresponding natural parameters.  Most of the programs used for
alignment deal only with the formal transform parameters; a few programs work
with the semi-natural parameters; and the program that provides interactive
adjustment of alignment allows one to specify changes in the fully natural
parameters.
<P>
Transforms stored in a file are represented by formal parameters.  Each
line of the file specifies:
<pre>
   A11   A12   A21   A22   DX  DY
</pre>
The command-line program 
<A HREF = "man/xf2rotmagstr.html#TOP">Xf2rotmagstr</A> can be used to convert
the transforms in a file into natural parameters.

<h3><A NAME = "FandG"></A>Background on F and G Transforms</h3>
Whenever there are more than two images, a series of transforms will be
needed to align the whole stack of images.  This series is obtained in two
stages.  First, each successive pair of images is considered separately, and a
transform is found that aligns the images when applied to the second image in
the pair.  This procedure yields a list of transforms that align each image to
the previous image; the programs consistently refer to this as a list of "<b>f</b>"
transforms.  Simply applying these <b>f</b> transforms to all of the images in the
stack will not help, because each section would be aligned to the previous one
only if that previous one were not itself transformed.  For example, consider
the following example of 3 sections that need to be shifted into alignment in
one dimension.  Here is a side view of the sections, where we need to align
the + marks in each section.
<pre>
 2  ---+------+-----
 1  -+------+-------
 0  ------+------+--
</pre>
The pairwise comparison of sections indicates that 1 must be shifted 5 units
to the right to align it to 0, and 2 must be shifted 2 units to the left to
align it to 1.  Performing those operations would give:
<pre>
 2 -+------+-----__    f: DX = -2
 1 _____-+------+--    f: DX = +5
 0 ------+------+--    f: DX =  0
</pre>
(Here, the underscores _ represent empty or non-existent image.)  The
misalignment here indicates that a second stage is necessary: one must obtain
the transforms for each image that will produce an aligned stack when actually
applied to the images.  This list is consistently referred to as a list of 
"<b>g</b>" or global transforms.  In our example, the appropriate <b>g</b>
transforms produce a proper alignment:
<pre>
 2 __---+------+---    g: DX = +2
 1 ____-+------+---    g: DX = +4
 0 -----+------+--_    g: DX = -1
</pre>
In summary, <b>f</b> transforms align each section to the preceding
one; <b>g</b> transforms align each section to the whole stack.

<h3><A NAME = "FtoG2"></A>Converting from an F List to a G List</h3>
As discussed in <A HREF = "#FandG">Background on F and G Transforms</A>, to get from the
list of <b>f</b> transforms to a useful
stack of aligned images, one must first convert them to <b>g</b> transforms using the
program <A HREF = "man/xftoxg.html#TOP">Xftoxg</A>.  This will produce transforms
that can be used to transform each section into a common alignment.  
<A HREF = "man/xftoxg.html#TOP">Xftoxg</A> has several different ways
of doing this, depending on whether you want to preserve or eliminate trends
in the data.  The following series of examples will illustrate the treatment
of trends.  Suppose we have sections with a progressive shift of positions:
<pre>
 3  --+------+--------
 2  ---+------+-------
 1  -------+------+---
 0  --------+------+--
</pre>
To get <b>g</b> transforms that will align all of the images to a single average
position, and eliminate the progressive shift, you can choose 
<B>Global alignments (remove all trends)</B>, which will make
<A HREF = "man/xftoxg.html#TOP">Xftoxg</A> be run with the option "-n 0".
The resulting <b>g</b> transforms, when applied to the images, would give:
<pre>
 3  ___--+------+-----
 2  __---+------+-----
 1 ------+------+---__
 0  -----+------+--___
</pre>
This result is generally usable if there are relatively few sections and if
you do not care about the image that is lost off the edges for sections
farther away from the center of the stack.  However, if there are a large
number of sections (say, > 30), the shifts can accumulate unacceptably.  Also,
there may be cases in which the cues that are used for alignment actually
should progress across the image area through the sections.  To avoid these
problems, it is possible to have each section aligned to a "local" average
alignment based on a linear fit to trends in the transformations for the
nearby sections.  This procedure will retain the trends but align adjacent
sections as well as possible by eliminating deviations from the trends.  This
is the default mode of operation of 
<A HREF = "man/xftoxg.html#TOP">Xftoxg</A>, invoked by the 
<B>Local fitting (retain trends)</B> choice.
The resulting transforms would give:
<pre>
 3  --+------+--------
 2  _---+------+------
 1  ------+------+---_
 0  --------+------+--
</pre>
The situation is more complex if there are trends in rotation or size.
Rotation trends can occur because of curvature of the ribbon of sections, or
because of progressive rotation of the features used for alignment.  Trends in
size can easily occur when using <A HREF = "man/xfalign.html#TOP">Xfalign</A>, if
the features that govern the alignment change size progressively through the
series.  Here is a series of sections with such a size change:
<pre>
 3  --+--x--+-----------
 2  --+---x---+---------
 1  -----+----x----+----
 0  -----+-----x-----+--
</pre>
Aligning to a single central position is clearly
inappropriate here because it squeezes the images at one end of the stack and
expands them at the other:
<pre>
 3  _---+----x----+-----
 2  __--+----x----+-----
 1  ----+----x----+----_
 0  _---+----x----+--___
</pre>
Aligning to a single central position tends to convert features of interest
into a right cylinder, regardless of their true geometry.  Again, we can avoid
this problem and retain all trends with the default choice,
with the following result:
<pre>
 3  --+--x--+-----------
 2  _--+---x---+--------
 1  ----+----x----+----_
 0  -----+-----x-----+--
</pre>
This may be an acceptable alignment, especially for very large numbers of
sections.  However, it is frequently desirable to eliminate the trend in
lateral displacements, particularly for images acquired on a CCD camera on the
microscope or digitized by a method that does not provide a good preliminary
alignment.  To handle these situation, there is a hybrid or mixed alignment 
method that 
is invoked with the choice <B>Remove trends in translation</B>.
The resulting transforms applied to the sections give the desired result
and avoid distorting the sizes of the objects:
<pre>
 3  ____--+--x--+-------
 2  ___--+---x---+------
 1  ----+----x----+----_
 0  ---+-----x-----+--__
</pre>
If you use hybrid alignments, you need to decide whether to eliminate or
retain any trends in rotation.  Rotations are probably artifactual and should
be eliminated if they are simply due to rotation of images during acquisition
or digitization.  However, automatic alignment with Xfalign may be dominated
by features that actually rotate within the volume, in which case rotation
trends should be preserved.  For example, a tightly packed bundle of
microtubules may have a twist, and if these microtubules dominate the
alignment, the alignment will contain a progressive rotation that should be
preserved.  Choose <B>Remove trends in translation & rotation</B> to eliminate
rotation trends.

<H3><A NAME = "Fiducial"></A>
Generating or Editing an Alignment with Fiducial Points</H3>
The program <A HREF = "man/xfmodel.html#TOP">Xfmodel</A> can solve for the
parameters of a transformation between sections from the locations of points
that are known or assumed to
correspond between the sections.  <A HREF = "man/xfmodel.html#TOP">Xfmodel</A>
works with a model of connected fiducial points built in 
<A HREF = "man/3dmod.html#TOP">3dmod</A>.  In the
simplest case, if you built a model
of fiducial points named "setname.fid", you would just enter
<pre>
     xfmodel setname.fid setname.xf
</pre>
to compute a list of <b>f</b> transforms.  By default, it will solve for the full
linear transformation, but there are also options to solve for translations
only, translations and rotations, or translations, rotations, and
magnifications.  Although it is most common to use this method to align an
entire image stack, one can also use <A HREF = "man/xfmodel.html#TOP">Xfmodel</A>
to "edit" an existing list of f
transforms.  That is, if one enters fiducial points for a subset of
troublesome sections, the program will solve for the transforms for those
sections only, and replace those transforms in the existing list.
<A HREF = "man/xfmodel.html#TOP">Xfmodel</A> can also be used to transform a model
to a new alignment (see below). 
<P>
One
limitation is that a warping transform file cannot be used as an existing
transform file to be edited by <A HREF = "man/xfmodel.html#TOP">Xfmodel</A>.

<H3><A NAME = "Realigning"></A>Realigning Images and Models</H3>
Sometimes one will find after modeling on a set of images that the
alignment needs to be improved.  
The operations to run depend on whether you
are going to reopen eTomo to modify the alignment of the original data, or
derive a refining alignment from the aligned data.  In either case, you should
first make a copy of the final <b>g</b> transforms from the original
alignment:
<pre>
    cp setname.xg setname_orig.xg
</pre>
since this will be needed and is going to be overwritten.
<P>
1) You can reopen eTomo and modify the <b>f</b> transforms or the choice of how
<A HREF = "man/xftoxg.html#TOP">Xftoxg</A> is run, then make a new aligned
stack.  To transform a model "setname.mod" into alignment with these images, run
<pre>
    xfmodel -pre setname_orig.xg -xf setname.xg setname.mod setname.newmod
</pre>
The "-pre" argument tells <A HREF = "man/xfmodel.html#TOP">Xfmodel</A> to
back-transform the model by the old <b>g</b> transforms, which aligns it to the raw
images, before transforming it by the
new transforms.
<P>
2) Suppose you work from the already aligned images or a model on them, and
derive a set of <b>f</b> transforms that would improve their alignment, in the file
"setname_refine.xf". These need to be converted to <b>g</b> transforms, but then
transforming the model is easy:
<pre>
    xftoxg setname_refine.xf setname_refine.xg
    xfmodel -xf setname_refine.xg setname.mod setname.newmod
</pre>
However, to get a new aligned stack, you should go back to the raw stack
instead of applying a second transformation to the aligned stack, in order to
avoid interpolating the data any more times than you have to (each
interpolation step potentially degrades the images).  To do this,
you need to multiply the first and second set of <b>g</b> transforms and apply the
product:
<pre>
    xfproduct setname_orig.xg setname_refine.xg setname.xg
</pre>
Then run:
<pre>
    subm newst
</pre>
for single-frame images or
<pre>
    subm blend
</pre>
for montages.  The existing aligned stack, if still present in the directory,
will be renamed with a "~" on the end, but you could rename this first to a
preferred name if you want to keep it.
<P>
There are several ways that you could work from an existing model to get
a refined alignment.  One way is to take Tiff snapshots of the Zap window in
<A HREF = "man/3dmod.html#TOP">3dmod</A> through the entire set of sections, with
either the model displayed on the images or just the model showing on a black
background.  (You can take such snapshots automatically with the dialog box
opened with File-Movie/Montage.)
Stack the Tiff files into a single color MRC file:
<pre>
    tif2mrc zap*.tif zapstack.mrc
</pre>
<A HREF = "man/midas.html#TOP">Midas</A> can read this file and display the colors
in gray scale, allowing you to adjust the alignment based on model features:
<pre>
    midas zapstack.mrc setname_refine.xf
</pre>
<P>
An existing model can also be used to provide a new fiducial alignment,
provided that it has features that have been modeled across the sections.
For example,
<pre>
    xfmodel setname.mod setname_refine.xf
</pre>
There is a script, <A HREF = "man/selfalign.html#TOP">Selfalign</A>, that will do
this operation as well as realign the model, producing new <b>f</b> transforms in a
".selfxf" file, new <b>g</b> transforms in a ".selfxg" file, and a new model ending
in ".selfmod".  Aside from convenience, the script has the advantage that it
can be given a limited number of sections over which to find the alignment,
and it will properly handle the transitions between the regions being
realigned and those being left as they were.  Use the ".selfxg" file like
"setname_refine.xg" in the xfproduct command above to get new <b>g</b>
transforms for building a new aligned stack.
