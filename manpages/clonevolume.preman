.SH NAME
clonevolume \- clone copies of a volume (typically a PEET averaged
subvolume) back to the aligned positions and orientations in a starting 
volume.
.SH SYNOPSIS
clonevolume  [options]  -at csv_file  -into into_vol  inVol  outVol

.SH DESCRIPTION
After aligning and averaging a set of subvolumes with PEET, it is often 
useful to copy the averaged subvolume back into a copy of an input volume 
at the positions and orientations of the individual aligned particles. 
Clonevolume performs this operation. The \fIin_vol\fR will be cloned
into \fIinto_vol\fR at locations and orientations specified by \fIcsv_file\fR,
and the output written to \fIout_vol\fR. The comma-separated value 
location/orientation file \fIcsv_file\fR will typically have been created by
PEET program createAlignedModel(1). The \fIout_vol\fR will be silently 
overwritten if it already exists. Neither \fIin_vol\fR, \fIinto_vol\fR
nor \fIcsv_file\fR will be modified.

The PEET alignment and corresponding average must have beem created
with "Align Averages Vertically" disabled for proper orientations of the
cloned subvolumes.

While clonevolume is designed for use with a csv location file and an 
input volume created by PEET, this is not required. Except for the first, 
header line, which is always ignored, each line in the location file 
must contain 7 comma-separated fields representing contour number, 
X, Y, and Z center coordinates in pixels, and Z-Y-X Slicer angles in degrees,
(stored in the order X, Y, Z), respectively.

.SH OPTIONS
Clonevolume uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for pip(1)).
Options can be specified either as command line arguments (with the -)
or one per line in a command file (without the -).  Options can be abbreviated
to unique letters; the currently valid abbreviations for short names are shown
in parentheses.
