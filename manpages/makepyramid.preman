.SH NAME
makepyramid \- Create an image pyramid for rapid viewing in 3dmod
.SH SYNOPSIS
makepyramid [options] input_file

.SH DESCRIPTION
Makepyramid will make an "image pyramid", a set of files representing the same
volume at a series of resolutions.  Images are also converted to a tiled
format so that subareas of large images can be read in quickly.  When 3dmod(1)
is run with the pyramid, any part of the volume, at any scale, can be viewed
relatively rapidly without have to load the entire volume at full resolution
into memory.  An image list file is created so that the pyramid can be opened
by just starting 3dmod(1) with this filename; also, all files can be placed
into a subdirectory and 3dmod(1) can be started with just the directory name.
Output volumes can be either MRC or TIFF files; compression is available with
the latter.
.P
The reduction factors applied to the original image are constrained to be
integers, but by
default, the reduction is not done with simple binning here.  Images are first
reduced in X and Y by Newstack(1) using antialias filtering, which is
important when images are noisy or reductions are large.  They are then
reduced in Z by Binvol(1), also with antialias filtering.
.P
There are default values for the reductions.  The default
reduction will produce reduced data whose sum is no more than 0.15 as big as
the original volume.  Here are some considerations if you want to set your own
values.
A common practice is to make a pyramid with reductions that are successive
powers of 2, at least in X and Y.  This is essentially the default and 
would correspond to an entry of 2,4,8,... to the 
.B -reductions
option.  If you have a giant area, you may find that larger steps are
sufficient in X and Y, e.g., 2,5,10,...  The reduction in Z does not have to
match that in X and Y.  Since
3dmod(1) still displays every original Z value when zoomed down and
interpolates between the ones in the file being accessed at that zoom, the
default reduction in Z is just 2,3,4...  If you do set your own reductions, you may
still want to reduce less in Z than in X and Y, e.g., "-zreductions 2,3,5".
.P
For the most rapid viewing of the whole area at low zoom, the last volume
should be smaller than 4 megapixels (2K x 2K for a square area), preferably
around 2 megapixels (1400 x 1400).  The default reduction accomplishes this as
well.
.P
Images are converted to a tiled form, either a montaged MRC file or a TIFF file
with storage in tiles, so that subareas can be loaded rapidly from the file.
When a file is not organized in tiles and a subarea in X is read from the
file, the system will typically need to read the whole line to access the
subarea.  Thus there is substantial benefit in converting the full-resolution
input file to tiles, especially if the size in X is much bigger than 4K,
although the
.B
-use
option allows you to skip this conversion.  If storage space is a concern and
you do not anticipate needing to access the
input file in its unmontaged form, it should be safe to delete it provided
that you created a montaged MRC file from it.  It can be
recreated from the montage with a command like
   reducemont -nofft -plin rootname-1xy-1z.pl -plout dummy.pl \
      rootname-1xy-1z.mrc full-size-file.mrc

.SS Options
Makepyramid uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for pip(1)).
Options can be specified either as command line arguments (with the -)
or one per line in a command file (without the -).  Options can be abbreviated
to unique letters; the currently valid abbreviations for short names are shown
in parentheses.

.B -StandardInput
Read parameter entries from standard input

.SH FILES
Image and piece list files are named as "rootname-#xy-#z...", where the
first "#" is the reduction in X and Y and the second "#" is the reduction in Z.
The extension is ".mrc" for MRC files, ".tif" for TIFF files, and ".pl" for piece
list files.  The image list file is named as rootname.imlist.
An existing copy of the output image and piece list files will be made into a
backup file by adding the extension ~.  An existing copy of the image list
file will be replaced.
