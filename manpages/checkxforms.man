.SH NAME
checkxforms - find maximum displacement & rotation in set of transforms
.SH SYNOPSIS
checkxforms
.SH DESCRIPTION
  CHECKXFORMS will examine a list of transformations to determine the
  maximum image rotation and the maximum image displacement specified
  by those transforms.  It reports the maximum rotation in degrees and
  the section number at which that maximum occurs, and the maximum
  displacement in pixels and the section number at which that maximum
  occurs.
.P
  After starting the program, just enter the names of desired transform
  files, one after another.  Type Return to exit the program when done.
