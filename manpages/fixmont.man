DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
  FIXMONT will substitute sections from one montage file into another,
  with a linear scaling of the intensities in the sections being
  substituted.  It can also be used with ordinary image stacks by
  making dummy piece lists for each of the stacks.
  
  Entries to the program:
  
  Name of image file to insert corrected sections into
  Name of list of piece coordinates for file to be corrected
  Name of image file with sections to be inserted into other file
  Name of list of piece coordinates for file with corrections
  
  List of section numbers to take from the correction file and
  substitute into the file to be corrected.  Enter / to take all
  sections; ranges may be entered (e.g., 9-11,14,7)
  
  A pair of intensity scaling factors for each section; intensities
  will be multiplied by the first factor, then the second factor will
  be added.  Enter / for factors of 1,0, which will leave intensities
  unchanged.

  The same image file (and the same piece list file) may be used
  for both entries.
