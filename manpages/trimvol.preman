.SH NAME
trimvol \- Trim a volume and optionally rotate or scale to bytes or integers
.SH SYNOPSIS
trimvol [options] <input file>  <output file>
.SH DESCRIPTION
Trimvol provides a command-line interface to the programs Findcontrast(1) and
Newstack(1), for copying a selected portion of an MRC image volume into a new
file, with automatic scaling to bytes.  
There are options for specifying the volume to be extracted, and for 
controlling the scaling to bytes.  There is also an option to scale 
floating point numbers to integers.
By default, coordinates are numbered from 1.

If you use the 
.B -sz
option, then Findcontrast(1) will be run on the specified sections.  By
default, regions
within 10% of the lateral borders of each section are omitted, but a different
region can be set with
.B -sx
and
.B -sy.
A scaling is
chosen which saturates the intensities of one pixel per slice, on average, at
the dark and the light end.  If you use 
.B -sz
The coordinates specified with these options will be treated as coming from 
a flipped volume only if the
.B -f
option is entered.

By default, the origin of the output file will be adjusted so that a model
built on the input volume will display correctly on the output file.  This
will even work for a volume rotated with
.B -rx
but not for one flipped with
.B -yz.
This adjustment can be turned off with the 
.B -k
option.

.SS Options
You can enter only one of
.B -c,
.B -sz
or
.B -mm.
Similarly, you cannot enter both
.B -x
and
.B -nx,
both
.B -y
and
.B -ny,
or both
.B -z
and
.B -nz.
You can also enter only one of 
.B -yz
and
.B -rx.
.P
Trimvol uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for pip(1)).
Options can be specified either as command line arguments (with the -)
or one per line in a command file (without the -):
INSERT OPTION TEXT HERE
.TP
.B -StandardInput
Read parameter entries from standard input

.SH FILES
If the output file already exists a backup image
of the original is created
with the ~ extension.  The temporary file needed when flipping or rotating is
created in the current directory with ".tmp.nnn" added to the input filename,
where "nnn" is the process ID.
