Notes:
<OL>
<LI> Template directives must either specify absolute paths or have just a
  filename with no path.  In the latter case, the files are sought in their
  default locations:
<UL>
<LI> A scope template file is expected to be in $IMOD_CALIB_DIR/ScopeTemplate.
<LI> For a system template, the program looks in
  $IMOD_CALIB_DIR/SystemTemplate, and if the file is not there, it looks for it
  in $IMOD_DIR/SystemTemplate.  Thus, a customized file placed in the
  IMOD_CALIB_DIR location will override a file of the same name distributed
  with IMOD.
<LI> A user template file is expected to be in the user's selected template
  directory, which is $HOME/.etomotemplate by default and can be changed in
  the Settings dialog in eTomo.
</UL>
<LI> Template and batch directive filenames must end in the extension ".adoc".
<LI> Rules for the treatment of directives and the format of values are
  described in the <A HREF="man/batchruntomo.html">man page</A> for
  Batchruntomo. Some essentials are:
<UL>
<LI> Directives are processed in order from scope template, system template,
  user template, and batch directive files, and later entries override earlier
  ones. 
<LI> All boolean directives must have either a 0 or a 1 after the equals sign,
  to turn the option off or on.
<LI> For all other kinds of directives, it is possible to have no value after
  the equals sign, which means that the parameter in question is not set, even
  if it was set by an earlier directive.  In the case of a "comparam" directive, 
  an empty value will cause the parameter to be removed from the command file.
</UL>
<LI> Directives marked with <B>Y</B> in the <B>Batch</B> column can be included in a
  batch directive file and will be acted on by Batchruntomo.
<LI> Directives marked with <B>Y</B> in the <B>Tmplt</B> column can be
  included in a template file.  The entry in the <B>Batch</B> column
  determines whether such directives have an effect when the relevant step is run by
  Batchruntomo.   The entry in the <B>eTomo</B> column determines
  whether they have an effect when running the relevant step for the first
  time in eTomo as well as the behavior of the directive editor now under
  construction.
<LI> The entry in the <B>eTomo</B> column has these meanings:
<UL>
<LI> <B>SD</B>: Saved by default into a directive file by eTomo, and will have
  an effect when running in eTomo.
<LI> <B>SO</B>: Optionally saved into a directive file by eTomo, and will have
  an effect when running in eTomo.
<LI> <B>Blank</B>: Not saved into a directive file by eTomo, or not visible by
  default in a directive editor but optionally savable, and will have
  an effect when running in eTomo.
<LI> <B>NE</B>: Will not (yet) have any effect if running in eTomo, and either
  not saved by eTomo or not visible by default in a directive editor.
<LI> <B>NE</B>: Will not (yet) have any effect if running in eTomo, but optionally
  saved into a directive file by eTomo.
</UL>
