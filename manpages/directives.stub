<LI> Rules for the treatment of directives and the format of values are
  described in the <A HREF="man/batchruntomo.html">man page</A> for Batchruntomo.
<LI> Directives marked with <B>Y</B> in the <B>Batch</B> column can be included in a
  batch directive file and will be acted on by Batchruntomo.
<LI> Directives marked with <B>Y</B> in the <B>Tmplt</B> column can be
  included in a template file.  The entry in the <B>Batch</B> column
  determines whether such directives have an effect when the relevant step is run by
  Batchruntomo.   The entry in the <B>eTomo</B> column determines
  whether they have an effect when running the relevant step for the first
  time in eTomo.
<LI> The entry in the <B>eTomo</B> column has these meanings:
<UL>
<LI> <B>SD</B>: Saved by default into a template file by eTomo, and will have
  an effect when running in eTomo.
<LI> <B>SO</B>: Optionally saved into a template file by eTomo, and will have
  an effect when running in eTomo.
<LI> <B>Blank</B>: Not saved into a template file by eTomo, and will have
  an effect when running in eTomo.
<LI> <B>NE</B>: Will not (yet) have any effect if running in eTomo.
</UL>
