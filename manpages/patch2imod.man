.SH NAME
patch2imod \- makes model from patch displacement or residual file
.SH SYNOPSIS
patch2imod [options] <patch file> <IMOD model file>
.SH DESCRIPTION
patch2imod creates an IMOD model from a file containing 3-D displacements at
a series of positions, such as the patch file generated by corrsearch3d(1).
Each displacement will be represented by a vector starting at the position
of the patch, and whose magnitude and direction are determined by the 3-D
displacement multiplied by a scale factor.  These vectors are simply open
contours consisting
of two points.  In addition, if the patch file contains correlation
coefficients or residual values, these values will be stored in the model.
.P
The resulting model can be viewed to determine the location of patches with 
aberrant displacements and even edited to remove such patches.  The
easiest way to do this is to start 3dmod with just the model file and no
image file, open the model view window, and use the right mouse button in
the model view window to select vectors that differ greatly from 
their neighbors.  The currently selected vector(s) will be highlighted by
being thicker.
They may then be deleted with the D hot key.  The edited
model can be converted back to a patch file with imod2patch(1).
.P
The correlation or residual values can be visualized by opening the "Values"
panel in the model view Object Edit window and selecting "Show stored values".
The color display can be manipulated and subsets of vectors can be selected.
.P
One can also
read the model in on top of a tomogram; it is marked as flipped so that it
will display correctly in such a case.
.P
The scaling is stored as the pixel size in the model header.  Do not change
this value, or imod2patch will not be able to convert the displacements back
correctly.
.P
The program will also convert a list of 2-D residuals produced by tiltalign(1).
In this case, the model is not marked as flipped, so that it can be displayed
on top of the original image file.
.SS Options
.TP
.B -s <value>
Change the vector length scaling to the given value; the default is 10.
.TP
.B -c <size>
Include four clipping planes in the model to enclose a square area of the
given size in the center of the model.  These planes will not be on by default,
but can be turned on and manipulated together in the model view Object Edit
window.  These planes could be helpful for seeing a subset of vectors when the
model is rotated.
.TP
.B -n <name>
Give this name to the model object.  The name is useful for indicating what
kind of values are stored with the vectors.
.SH FILES
If the model file already exists, it becomes a backup file with ~ added to its
name.
