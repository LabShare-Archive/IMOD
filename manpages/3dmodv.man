.SH NAME
3dmodv \- View an Imod model.
.SH SYNOPSIS
3dmodv [options] <model files...>
.SH DESCRIPTION
3dmodv is used to view models drawn with 3dmod.  The main 3dmodv window is
similar to the "Model View" window available in the program 3dmod.  When
run from the command line, 3dmodv can read and save models through the File 
menu.  Multiple models can be loaded and manipulated independently, either by 
putting their names on the command line or by loading them one after another
through the File menu.
The command line options are given below.
