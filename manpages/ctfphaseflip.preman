.SH NAME
ctfphaseflip \- correct tilt series for microscope CTF by phase flipping 
.SH SYNOPSIS
ctfphaseflip  options
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program will correct the CTF of an input tilt series by simple phase
flipping.  The user can select a subset of projection views of the input tilt
series to correct and
can specify a defocus value for each selected view through a text defocus
file.
The output file of ctfplotter(1) is usually used as the defocus file.

Ctfphaseflip corrects each view strip by strip.  A strip is defined as an image
region whose defocus difference is less than a user specified value, but the
width is also limited to 256 pixels.

It can be run in a parallel mode similiar to the Tilt(1) program by setting the
TotalViews option.

.SS Options
Ctfphaseflip uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page
for pip(1)).  Options can be specified either as command line
arguments (with the -) or one per line in a command file
(without the -):
