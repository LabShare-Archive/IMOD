.SH NAME
etomo - A GUI program to run IMOD and PEET batch programs


.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP
.B etomo \fR[\fIoption\fR ...] [\fIdata_file\fR ...]


.SH
DESCRIPTION
\fBEtomo\fR is an interface for running a subset of IMOD and PEET commands.  It
can be run interactively, with automation, or with a combination of
the two.  ETomo contains interfaces for a variety of projects:  tomographic
reconstructions, joining tomograms, subvolume averaging, aligning serial sections,
blending montages, nonlinear anisotropic diffusion, running processes using IMOD's
parallel processing capabilies, flattening tomograms, and testing a GPU.

.SS Automation
Automating eTomo functionality can be done either with eTomo parameters or with
directives. For more information on directives, run \fBimodhelp\fR and choose "Directives
for batch processing and eTomo templates" on the IMOD Help Index page.
