.SH NAME
tif2mrc \- Make a MRC file from TIFF image files.
.SH SYNOPSIS
tif2mrc [-g | -G | -u | -d] [-b file] <TIFF files...> <MRC file>
.SH DESCRIPTION
tif2mrc takes a series of TIFF files and converts them
into an MRC stack.  
tif2mrc can also convert a single multi-page TIFF file to an MRC stack.
.P
Only grayscale and color image files are supported.
Grayscale images must be 8 or 16 bit integers or 32 bit floats.
Color images must be either 24 bit with pixels stored as 
red-green-blue triplets, or 8-bit with an embedded colormap.  Colormapped 8-bit
images will be converted to 24 bit RGB images, since this is the kind of 
color MRC file that IMOD defines.  If a grayscale image file has multiple
sample values per pixel, then each sample will be converted to a separate
section in the output file, and the input file will be treated like a
multi-page TIFF file.  The multiple
samples can be stored either contiguously or in separate planes.
.P
Images from different files need not all be the same size.
The x and y dimensions of the stack
are set from the x and y size of the first image, unless the 
.B -o
option is used to set the output size.
Images that are larger than the output size will be cropped around all four
sides, and images that are smaller will be placed in the center of the output
area and surrounded with gray.
.P
Most of the options have to do with the treatment of unsigned 16-bit numbers.
The standard MRC file mode for holding 16-bit integers is mode 1, which holds
signed (positive and negative) values and has a range from -32768 to 32767.
Unsigned integers, with a range from 0 to 65535, can be stored in file mode 6,
which is a nonstandard mode.  If the TIFF file has a tag indicating that it
contains unsigned integers, then by default the program will preserve these
values in a file of mode 6.  You can alter this behavior and store the numbers
as signed values (mode 1) in three ways: 1) with the
.B -u
option to subtract 32768, which will preserve the dynamic range of the values;
2) with the
.B -d
option to divide by 2, which will throw away one bit of precision but keep the
numbers positive; or 3) with the
.B -s
option to force the numbers to be saved unmodified in mode 1, which will be
fine as long as there are no values above 32767.  Finally, if the TIFF file
lacks a tag indicating that it is unsigned but the numbers do range above
32767, you can preserve unsigned integers and force output into a file of mode
6 with the 
.B -k
option.  
.SS Options
.TP
.B -g
This
option will convert 24-bit color images to 8-bit grayscale in the MRC stack by
equal weighting of the three color components.  This weighting has always been
used with this option to Tif2mrc, and is also the way that 3dmod read in color
data with its -G option prior to IMOD 3.12.10.
.TP
.B -G
This
option will convert 24-bit color images to 8-bit grayscale in the MRC stack by
the NTSC weighting of the three color components, which is used when reading
color data as grayscale into 3dmod (as of IMOD 3.12.10), and when changing
the mode of images from color to grayscale with Clip(1).
.TP
.B -u
With this option, the program will convert 16-bit numbers from unsigned to
signed integers by subtracting 32768.
Use this option if the TIFF files have positive numbers ranging above 32767,
you want an output file of mode 1, and
you do not want to lose any of the dynamic range of the numbers.
.TP
.B -d
With this option, the program will treat 16-bit numbers as unsigned integers
and divide them by two.  The resulting numbers will range between 0 and 32767.
Use this option if the TIFF files have positive numbers ranging above 32767,
you want an output file of mode 1, you want the numbers to remain positive,
and you do not mind losing one bit of precision.
.TP
.B -s
With this option, the program will treat numbers as signed integers and just
store them in a file of mode 1.  Use this option if an unsigned integer file
contains values under 32768 and you want a file of mode 1.
The program will print the minimum and maximum values in the output
file.  If the min is near -32768 and the max is near 32767, this option was
chosen incorrectly.
.TP
.B -k
With this option, the program will treat numbers as unsigned and output data
into a file of mode 6 even if there is no tag indicating the data are unsigned.
.TP
.B -f
If only one input file is given and it is a multi-page TIFF file, the program
will convert all of the pages in the file into sections in an MRC file.  Use
this option to make the program ignore the multiple pages and read only the
first image.  This option is no longer needed to process files with thumbnail 
images embedded; if there are pages with differnt sizes, only the largest size
will be converted to sections, and thus a thumbnail image will be ignored.
.TP
.B -o <#,#>
Set the size of the output to the given dimensions in X and Y.  This option
has no effect for multi-page input files.
.TP
.B -p <#>
Set the pixel spacing in the header of the output file to the given value.
This spacing is defined as having units of Angstroms, but you can place
arbitrary values there.
.TP 
.B -b file
This option loads a background file in TIFF format.
If a background file is loaded its values are subtracted from
the values in the rest of the files.
The background file must have the same data type as the images from which
it is being subtracted (8-bit or 16-bit grayscale).
.SH FILES
If the output file already exists, it will be made a backup file by adding ~
to its name.

.SH BUGS
If a standard TIFF library is not installed, images must be uncompressed and
must consist of strips rather than tiles, and colormap files cannot be read.
