  This program allows one to "edit" a list of piece coordinates, or a list of
  integer point coordinates, in three ways:
  1) The set of Z values may be mapped, one-to-one, to any arbitrary new set
  of Z values; and
  2) The X, Y or Z coordinates of all pieces or points may be shifted by a
  constant.
  3) The overlap between pieces can be changed.
  In addition, one can create a new piece list for single frame images or
  montaged images.  The pieces can be ordered in rows or in columns.
  
  The remapping of Z values is specified by a list of values (comma-separated
  ranges, e.g. 0-3,5-7).  This list must have the same number of Z values as
  in the input list of Z values.  The Z values in the input list will be
  mapped one-to-one onto the new list.  Enter "/" to take the input list
  without modification Enter numbers between -999 and -990 to delete points
  with a particular Z value; e.g. if the input list has Z values from 0 to 9,
  entering 0-4,-999,5-8 will delete all points with Z between 4.5 and 5.5, and
  shift the Z of points with Z greater then 5.5 down by 1.  If the input list
  has Z from 0-19, entering 0-9,-999--990 will remove all pooints with Z from
  10 to 19.  Enter -1 to replace each Z value with its negative.

  When you create a new piece list, you control the overlap between pieces by
  entering a spacing instead.  This spacing is the frame size minus the
  overlap; e.g., for a size of 2048 and an overlap of 10%, one would enter
  2048 - 204 = 1844.  Spacing can be measured by taking the difference between
  the coordinates of corresponding points in adjacent pieces.  For example, if
  a feature is at an X coordinate of 1800 in one piece and at 100 in the piece
  to the right, then the spacing in X is 1800 - 100 = 1700.  Enter a negative
  number for X spacing if pieces are ordered from right to left, or a negative
  number for Y spacing if pieces are ordered from top to bottom.  Enter / if
  you just have one piece.

  Edpiecepoint uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for pip(1))
  and can still take sequential input interactively.  The following options
  can be specified either as command line arguments (with the -) or one per
  line in a command file or parameter file (without the -).  Options can be
  abbreviated to unique letters; the currently valid abbreviations for short
  names are shown in parentheses.

INSERT OPTION TEXT HERE

  -StandardInput
     Read parameter entries from standard input.


  If there are no command-line arguments, Edpiecepoint takes sequential input
  the old way, with the following entries:
  
  Name of input piece or point list file, or Return if none
  
  IF you enter "Return", then the program will create a new piece
     list.  Then make the following 4 entries:
     
     Number of sections (N) for which to make piece coordinates.  The Z
       coordinates will initially run from 0 to N-1, and the lower left X and
       Y coordinates will be 0.

     Number of pieces in X and in Y (enter / for 1,1)

     Spacing between pieces in X and in Y.  See above.

     0 if pieces progress along rows in the image file, or 1 if they progress
     along columns.
  
  Name of output piece or point list file
  
  New list of Z values.  See above.
  
  Amounts to add to all X, Y, and Z coordinates.  These values will be
     added after the remapping of Z values, if any.
