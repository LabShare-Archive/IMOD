.SH NAME
imodfindbeads \- Find gold particles in images
.SH SYNOPSIS
imodfindbeads options in_image out_model
.SH DESCRIPTION
Imodfindbeads finds gold particles or other circular densities (beads) in
images by a combination of cross-correlation and other methods.  It starts
by correlating with a model of a spherical bead of a specified size, then
forms an average out of the most strongly-correlating subset and repeats the
procedure by correlating with the average.  It analyzes
the distribution of correlation strengths to find the strength that best
separates the particles of interest from similar densities.  The positions of
the beads are stored in an IMOD model along with strengths for each.  The
points can then be visualized in 3dmod(1), and with the help of the Bead Fixer
module, the threshold can be adjusted and points below threshold can be
deleted.
.P
Rather than cross-correlating with a model or averaged bead, the program
applies an edge-detecting filter (Sobel, by default) to both the images and
the reference, and correlates the filtered images.  This method improves
the detectability of the beads and may improve the accuracy of the center
positions.  However, it only works well for beads in a certain size range, so
the program first scales the images to bring the beads to a specified size (8,
by default).  The peaks in this correlation are the set of candidate positions
for the beads.
.P
At each position, the program then computes an integral of the bead density
relative to the background in an annulus around the bead.  
The program can then work with three measures of peak strength.  One is the
strength of the Sobel-filter correlation (which includes a component based on 
the density of the bead, a factor lost when using a normalized correlation
coefficient).  The second is the integrated density, and the third is the
geometric mean of the first two.  
Whichever measure is chosen, it is scaled so that the maximum value is 1.
.P
Correlation with a simple item like a bead always produces many more peaks
than actual beads, but a histogram of peak strength generally shows a dip
between actual beads and spurious peaks.  The program thus computes a
histogram and smooths it with kernel smoothing, whereby a narrow distribution
function instead of a single point is added into the histogram at every peak
position.  The width of this function is the kernel width, referred to as
H in program output.  The program tries a series of widths, from 0.2 downward,
until it finds a dip in the histogram; then it computes it again with a kernel
width of 0.05 in order to locate the dip more accurately.
.P
After the initial correlation with a model bead, the program uses the
histogram analysis to select beads to average as a template for the second
round correlation.  If the analysis
fails, it is possible to bypass it by entering a relative peak strength to use
as a criterion for selecting beads.  After the second round of correlations,
the location of the dip is used to determine which points to output in the
model.  The default is to output a number of points below the dip so that the
user can check and adjust the threshold if necessary.  However, with the
.B -store
option, you can output just the points above the dip or a certain fraction of
the strongest peaks above the dip.  Or, if the histogram analysis fails,
this option can be used to bypass it and specify the actual peak strength to
use as the criterion for output.
.P
The most significant options described below are: 
.B -size
to specify the bead size, 
.B -area
to specify a model with contours around areas to analyze,
.B -light
if beads are light on a dark background,
.B -store
to control storage of peaks in the model as just described,
.B -spacing
to allow points closer together than the bead size,
.B -sections
to select the sections to be analyzed, and
.B -maxsec
to set how many of them will be analyzed in one group.
In addition, if images are noisy, it may be helpful to use linear
interpolation with
.B -linear
and add some filtering with either
.B -kernel
or
.B -rad2
and 
.B -sig2.
There are many other options that were added during program development and
can be ignored.
.SS Options
Imodfindbeads uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page
for pip(1)).  Options can be specified either as command line
arguments (with the -) or one per line in a command file
(without the -):
