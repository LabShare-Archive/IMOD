  This program searches for the best general linear transform between a pair
  of images by varying either the six formal parameters of the transform, the
  six "semi-natural" parameters underlying such a transform, or restricted
  subsets of those semi-natural parameters.

  These semi-natural parameters are, in the order in which the program will
  consider them:
     Delta X
     Delta Y
     Global rotation (average rotation of X & Y axes)
     Global magnification (average stretch of X & Y axes)
     Difference between stretch along Y- & X-axis
     Difference between rotation of Y- & X-axis
  With the -variables option, one enters either zero to search for formal
  parameters, or a number specifying how many of the natural parameters are to
  be varied.  If one selects 2, only Delta X and Delta Y will be varied; if
  one selects 4, global rotation and magnification will be varied also. At the
  end, the program outputs a six-parameter transformation (the 2x2 A matrix
  and DX and DY) in the standard format.

  Because the search method used by this program works iteratively from a
  given starting point, it is unlikely to find the proper alignment if it
  requires a large displacement.  To overcome this problem, the program
  can be given an initial transformation to work from. This allows a large
  displacement to be found by cross-correlation and passed to this program.

  To find the best fit between images, the search can optimize either a simple
  point-by-point difference between the images, the cross-correlation
  coefficient, or a measure of the distance between points of similar
  intensities in the images.  The resulting transformation is applied to the
  second image to align it to the first.

  The search uses a so-called simplex minimization routine which starts
  searching with an initial step size and refines the step size near a
  minimum.  It terminates the minimization when either 1) the most recent
  points under consideration gave difference measures all within a certain
  fractional tolerance of the point with the minimum measure; or 2) the most
  recent points had transformation parameters all within a certain tolerance
  of the point with the minimum measure. The latter tolerances are expressed
  as fractions of the following basic step sizes: 1 for delta X and Y; 0.025
  for the 4 parameters of the transformation matrix, if using formal
  parameters; or 2 degrees for global rotation and differences between X and Y
  rotations, and 0.025 for global magnification and difference between X and Y
  magnifications, if using semi-natural parameters.
  
  By default, the program will perform an initial minimization with a coarse
  tolerance for termination, then it will restart the minimization at the best
  point, and terminate with a finer tolerance. If the overall alignment method
  involves two stages, coarse and fine, then you should omit the initial
  minimization by specifying tolerances of zero for it.

  At the end of the search, the program outputs the number of iterations,
  the minimum difference/distance or maximum correlation value found, and the
  transformation parameters.  If semi-natural parameters were searched for,
  first those parameters are output, then the formal parameter matrix is
  output.  The difference measure is normalized to be the mean difference per
  pixel as a multiple of the standard deviation of the first image.  If
  correlation coefficients are used, then the measure of difference being
  minimized is one minus the correlation coefficient.  The distance measure is
  expressed as the mean distance per comparison point.

  Xfsimplex uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for pip(1))
  and can still take sequential input interactively, to maintain compatibility
  with old command scripts.  The following options can be specified either as
  command line arguments (with the -) or one per line in a command file or
  parameter file (without the -).  Options can be abbreviated to unique
  letters; the currently valid abbreviations for short names are shown in
  parentheses.

     Read parameter entries from standard input.


  A subset of entries can still be made by running the program interactively.
  All of the parameters have defaults which may be selected with , or / (the
  values in [] below and contained in [] in the prompts)

     transformation parameter values, to allow termination of final or
     only minimization [.0005 and 0.02, or .001 and 0.04 for
     images no bigger than 128 by 128]

  ***line 6

     vary [0]

  ***lines 7-10
  Fraction of images to ignore at edges [0.05]; or number of pixels

     do not float images (-1) [1]

  If difference measure is chosen, one more line of input:

  ***line 11

  If distance measure is chosen, 5 more lines of input:

  *** lines 11-14
  distance to search to eliminate redundant points with similar
     densities from comparison [default depends on image size after
     reduction, if any: 0 for # of pixels < 240*180, 1 if # of pixels
     between 240*180 and 480*360, 2 if # of pixels > 480*360
  distance to search for matching densities [4 if reduce by 2, 5 if
     not]
  maximum density difference constituting a match [0.05]
  Number of ranges of densities to make comparisons with [2]

  *** line 15
  lower and upper PERCENTILES for these ranges.  The default is 0,8,92,
    100 for small images.  This means that the darkest 8% and brightest
     8% of pixels will be used for comparison (minus ones eliminated
     because of redundancy).  The default depends on image size after
     reduction, if any; the range is scaled from 8% down to 5% as image
     size increases from 320*240 to 640*480

  The distance measure has been little used and the defaults for it are based
  on limited experimentation. These defaults are set in an attempt to
  limit the number of "points for comparison" to several thousand.  If
  there are more than about "5000 points for comparison", you should
  depart from the defaults in order to reduce this number.
