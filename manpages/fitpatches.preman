.SH NAME
fitpatches \- manage and fit to patch vector files for supermontaging
.SH SYNOPSIS
fitpatches options supermontage_info_file
.SH DESCRIPTION
Fitpatches is a Python program that assists with the evaluation and editing of
patch vector files produced by Edgepatches(1) and provides information on
aberrant vectors to Stitchalign(1).  It uses Refinematch(1) to fit a single
linear transformation to the original patch vectors and produce a set of
"reduced" vectors with the often large linear component removed.  The resulting
patch vector file retains the correlation coefficients originally produced by
Corrsearch3d(1).  The program also runs
Findwarp(1) on these reduced vectors and shows the mean and maximum residual
and outlier information provided by fitting in Findwarp(1).  The resulting
patch vector file contains a residual value for each vector and a value for
the fraction of fits on which the vector was excluded as an outlier.  This
file will be used by Stitchalign(1) to determine which vectors to exclude as
outliers or because of their high residuals.  Fitpatches also manages making
vector models from the patch files when the latter are newly derived, and
converting vector models back to patch files after they have been edited.
.P
The files managed by this program have the following names:
.nf
edgename.patch         -  Original patch vectors with CCCs
edgename_ccc.mod       -  Original vector model with CCCs
edgename_reduce.patch  -  Reduced patch vectors with CCCs
edgename_reduce.mod    -  Reduced vector model with CCCs
edgename_resid.patch   -  Reduced vectors with residuals/outlier fractions
edgename_resid.mod     -  Reduced vector model with residuals
.fi
.P
The program is designed to perform appropriate operations after you edit any
one of the patch vector models.  Specifically,
each time it is run, it first determines whether the vector model
corresponding to each of the three kinds of patch files has been edited; i.e.,
whether it contains fewer vectors than the current patch file does.  If so,
that vector model is converted back to a patch file, and the current file is
saved as a backup by adding "~" to its name.
.P
Next, the program determines whether to make new reduced vectors from the
original vectors.  It will do this if the reduced vectors do not yet exist, or
if the original vectors have been edited while the reduced vectors have not
been edited, either now or on a previous run of the program.  In other words,
once you have edited the reduced vectors with CCCs, they are protected from
being overwritten.  When the program makes a new set of reduced vectors, it
will also make a vector model from the patch file.
.P
Finally, the program always runs Findwarp(1) to make a new set of vectors with
residual and outlier information.  The input patch vectors for this are either
the reduced vectors or the existing set of vectors with residuals.  The
reduced vectors are used if the vectors with residuals do not exist yet, or if
the vectors with residuals have not been edited yet and the reduced vectors
are new in some manner (i.e., have just been edited, or have just been
produced from the original vectors).  Otherwise, the residual vectors
themselves are used as input to Findwarp(1) to make a new set of vectors with
residuals.  In other words, once you have edited the vectors with
residuals, they will not be overwritten by running Findwarp(1) on the reduced
vectors.  After running Findwarp(1), the program makes a new vector model from
the patch file.
.P
If you go back to Edgepatches(1) to make new original patches, Edgepatches(1)
will remove the entries for the derived patches from the supermontage info
file, and Fitpatches will make new patch files unconditionally when you run it
again.
.P
You should run Fitpatches immediately after Edgepatches(1), and also after any
editing of the vector models, to ensure that Stitchalign(1) has up-to-date
information on the residuals and outliers.  You are free to edit any of
the vector models in any sequence, but there is no reason to edit the original
vectors, since it is easier to see problems in reduced vectors.  It is
probably more useful to edit the patches with residuals than the reduced
patches with CCCs.  If you do want to edit both kinds of patches, it is
recommended that you first edit the reduced patches with CCCs, then run
Fitpatches to make new patches with residuals, then edit the patches with
residuals.
.SS Options
Edgepatches uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page
for pip(1)).  Options can be specified either as command line
arguments (with the -) or one per line in a command file
(without the -):
INSERT OPTION TEXT HERE
.TP
.B -StandardInput
Read parameter entries from standard input

.SH FILES
The files managed by the program are listed above.
Every time the info file is modified, the existing copy is renamed to a backup
with the ~ extension.
