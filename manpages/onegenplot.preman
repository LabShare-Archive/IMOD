.SH NAME
onegenplot \- Make an X/Y plot with genhstplt
.SH SYNOPSIS
onegenplot [options] data_file
.SH DESCRIPTION
Onegenplot is a Python script to make Genhstplt(1) draw one X/Y plot then exit
when its graph window is closed.  It has many default settings so that simple
graphs can be viewed with a minimum of entries.
.P
The data file is a text file with one or more columns of data values for each
individual item, separated by commas, spaces, or tabs.  In addition, the first entry
for each item can be a type number or group identifier.  The file can have
non-numeric lines at the beginning that need to be skipped over.  In most
cases, this program can automatically detect both the number of columns of
data values and how many lines of non-numeric text to skip at the beginning.
See the 
.B -ncol
and
.B -skip
options for the limitations of this capability.
.P
If there are no types in the file, you can graph one or more columns
of values versus one other column.  If there are types, you can graph one
column versus another for one or more types.  In addition, you use a sequence
of numbers instead of a data column for the X values, and thus plot the
sequential values of one or more columns or types.
.P
Note that the graph window can be saved as a PNG file or printed from a popup
menu brought up by right-clicking in the window.  For publication-quality
graphs in Postscript, it is necessary to run Genhstplt(1) directly.
.SS Options
Onegenplot uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page
for pip(1)).  Options can be specified either as command line
arguments (with the -) or one per line in a command file
(without the -).  Options can be abbreviated to unique letters; the currently
valid abbreviations for short names are shown in parentheses.

.SH EXAMPLES
If the data file has 2 or more columns, 
   onegenplot data_file
.br
will plot the second column versus the first, showing scattered open circles.
.P
If the data file has at least 5 columns,
   onegenplt -col 1,3,5 -con data_file
.br
will plot column and 3 and 5 versus column 1, with circles and X's,
respectively, connected by lines.
.P
If the data file has type numbers 10, 20, 30, and 40 and at least 5 data columns,
  onegenplt -col 2,4 -type 20,40 -sym 10,9 data_file
.br
will plot column 4 versus column 2 for types 20 and 40 with closed and open
circles, respectively.
.P
If the data file has has 120 lines of data in 6 columns,
   onegenplt -col 3,6 -sym 0,0 -con -ord data_file
.br
will plot columns 3 and 6 sequentially versus 1 to 120 with lines and no symbols.
