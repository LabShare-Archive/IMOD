  Tomopieces figures out how to chop up a tomogram into pieces so that the
  Fourier transforms or other operations on each piece can be done in
  memory.  It makes its decisions based on the maximum number of voxels
  that should be included in each piece.  For typical processing, such as
  for taking an FFT, the memory consumed will be about four times the
  number of voxels, since data are typically stored in memory as real
  numbers.  The program chooses a division of the volume that minimizes
  the total surface area of the extracted pieces, subject to specified
  constraints on the number of pieces in each dimension.
  
  Its one required input is the name of the tomogram file.  Optional
  inputs specify the maximum number of voxels, the maximum number of
  pieces to extract in each dimension, the border sizes for padding
  (and tapering) the extracted pieces, and the amount of overlap to
  generate between the extracted pieces. 

  It outputs the number of pieces in X and Z, the index coordinates in
  X, Y, and Z required for extracting each piece with Taperoutvol,
  and the index coordinates required for putting the pieces back
  together with Assemblevol (first the X coordinates for each position
  in X, then the Y coordinates for each position in Y, then the Z
  coordinates for each position in Z).
  
  Tomopieces uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for pip(1)).
  The following options can be specified either as command line arguments
  (with the -) or one per line in a command file or parameter file (without
  the -).  Options can be abbreviated to unique letters; the currently valid
  abbreviations for short names are shown in parentheses.
