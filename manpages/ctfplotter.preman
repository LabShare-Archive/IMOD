.SH SYNOPSIS
ctfplotter  options
.SH DESCRIPTION
This GUI program will plot the logarithm of a rotationally averaged power
spectrum of an input tilt 
series after subtracting the noise floor.  The method is based on periodogram 
averaging; namely, averaging of spectra from small, overlapping areas of
the images, referred to as tiles.  The user can interactively choose which
projection views are included in the averaging.

The noise floor is based on actual measurements of noise in an image taken
with no specimen in the beam.  Thus, in order to use this program, you need to
collect a set of such blank images, at a series of beam intensities, and place
each image in a separate file.  These noise files are specific not only to the
microscope but also to the CCD camera used, the operating voltage, and the
binning.  The mean counts in these files should span the range of the mean
counts in the data being analyzed.  The interval between intensities can be a
factor of 1.5; interpolation is used to estimate the noise for an image whose
mean counts do not match one of the noise files.  For example, for a camera
that has a gain of 10 counts per electron, one might collect images at mean
counts near 100, 150, 225, etc., up to 2210.  With a 1 nm pixel size, these
noise files could be used with images where the dose recorded at the camera
ranged from 0.1 to 2.2 electrons per square Angstrom.  If you need files for
analyzing both unbinned and binned data, you can take one set of unbinned
noise images and then bin them with a Newstack(1) command like this:
   newstack -bin 2 -mult 4,0  input_file output_file

The multiplication by 4 (the square of the binning factor) is necessary to make
the counts be the same as they would be for binned images from the microscope
with the same exposure.

If there are significant numbers of X-rays in the noise images, you should
clean them with Ccderaser(1), such as with:
   ccderaser -find -peak 8 -diff 6  input_file output_file

The noise files must have positive means; i.e., their values should be
proportional to the recorded electrons.  If they are acquired with software
that subtracts 32768 before storing as signed integers, then you need to add
this offset back to the data in order to use them as noise files.

The noise files are listed in a simple text file, the configuration file
specified by the -config option.  To be found easily from within eTomo, the
latter file should be placed in a directory named
/usr/local/ImodCalib/CTFnoise or in $IMOD_CALIB_DIR/CTFnoise if the
environment variable IMOD_CALIB_DIR has been defined differently from the
default.  You can then place the noise files in a subdirectory of CTFnoise,
for example, F20.  In this case, the configuration file would contain a
list like this:
.nf
F20/file1.st
F20/file2.st
F20/file3.st
...
.fi

When you start the program, it will first load and analyze all of the noise
files.  Then it will read in the images within the specified initial angular
range and compute power spectra from the central tiles.  This initial
computation of tile power spectra is the most time-consuming step, whereas
recomputing a summed power spectrum from the spectra of individual tiles is
quick.  The program thus stores the power spectrum for each tile in a cache
when it is computed.  You will have to wait several seconds whenever you add
non-central tiles from the current angular range, or when you change the
angular range to include views that have not been analyzed before.  However,
once all of the tiles on all views have been analyzed, the program will
respond quickly when you change angular ranges or defocus values.

Found defocus values can be saved in a text file that can be used as
input to the CTF correction program ctfphaseflip(1).

A sample command file for running the program at the command line
can be found in the IMOD/com directory.

.SS Options
Ctfplotter uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page
for pip(1)).  Options can be specified either as command line
arguments (with the -) or one per line in a command file
(without the -).  Options can be abbreviated to unique letters; the currently
valid abbreviations for short names are shown in parentheses.

.SH BUGS
Prior to IMOD 4.0.29, Ctfplotter had a bug in which the view numbers written
to the defocus file were numbered from 0, not 1.  When Ctfplotter reads in
an existing defocus file, it will do its best to detect this situation
and adjust all the view numbers up by 1.  If it does detect an inconsistency
between view numbers and angular ranges, it will issue a warning.
