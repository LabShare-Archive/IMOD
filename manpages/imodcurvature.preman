.SH NAME
imodcurvature \- Measures radius of curvature of model objects
.SH SYNOPSIS
imodcurvature options in_model out_model
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program will compute the local radius of curvature of objects in a model
and encode that value into the model as a color or a 2D or 3D point size.
It can compute either a 2D or a 3D radius of curvature by fitting circles or
spheres to contours.
For fitting in 2D, it computes the radius of curvature at each point in a
contour by fitting to a segment of the contour centered on the point; the
length of this segment is set by a parameter called the window length.  This
parameter should be varied to explore the tradeoff between averaging over
larger areas and having a less noisy result.
This 2D fitting should be very reliable because the search for the center and
radius of the circle is initialized by an explicit solution for the circle
through three widely spaced points along the contour.   However, the 2D
fitting will produce a gradient of
curvatures in a spherical object because the radius of cross-sections
decreases away from the equator.
.P
The 3D fitting is activated by specifying
a parameter for the range in Z over which to fit.  The objects to be fit must
contain a mesh (produced by Imodmesh(1)) so that connections between contours
can be deduced.  In this case the program
computes the radius for each point by sampling points from contours above and
below the point in Z.  The fit of 4 parameters to these sample points may be
somewhat less reliable because it is still initialized by the explicit solution
for a circle fit to the central contour.  No fit is done to a point unless
there is at least one contour above and one contour below the point in Z.
Here one may need to explore the
effects of varying both the window length and the Z range.
.P
If contours are in arbitrary planes rather than in Z planes, the 
.B -ro
option allows them to be individually rotated into the best-fitting plane, and
the 2D curvature can then be determined.
.P
A radius of curvature is encoded into the model only if it falls within the
range of the lower and upper criteria set with the 
.B -rc
option.  In addition, a
criterion for the root mean square error of the fit may be set with the 
.B -fc
option, in which case a radius is encoded only if the fit gave an error
less than this criterion.

The radius value can be used to set a color, a 3D point size, or a 2D symbol
size for each individual point that meets the criteria.  One or a few colors
can be specified with the 
.B -co
option, or a full false-color palette can be used with the 
.B -pa
option.  In addition, the curvature values can be stored directly in the
model, in which case 3dmod(1) will display the values in false color by
default.  This method allows dynamic control over the display.
With either method for color display, the model needs to be remeshed to see 
the colors in the model
view of 3dmod(1).  The 3D points are useful for seeing the exact values of the
radius by opening the Surface/Contour/Point dialog in 3dmod(1).  They 
could also be useful for visualizing the fit in the
3dmod(1) Zap window, provided that one selects the option in the Edit Object
dialog to show the spheres only on their central section.  These spheres will
impair the display in the model view window, however.  An alternative is to
encode the radius as 
circular symbols; however, they will only have the right size at the
particular zoom specified with the
.B -sy
option.

.SS Options
Imodcurvature uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page
for pip(1)).  Options can be specified either as command line
arguments (with the -) or one per line in a command file
(without the -):
