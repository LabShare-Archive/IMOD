  This program will compute projections of a 3-dimensional block of an
  image file at a series of tilts around either the X, the Y or the Z
  axis.  The block may be any arbitrary subset of the image file.  In addition
  to projecting a fixed block of data, it can project a rectangle of data in
  each X/Y image plane that is aligned with the angle of projection, which is
  useful for common line analysis.
  
  A projection along a ray line is simply the average of the pixels in
  the block along that line.  However, rather than taking the values of
  the pixels that lie near the ray, interpolation is used to sample
  density at points evenly spaced at one pixel intervals along the ray.

  When the input images are a tilt series and any one of the options are
  entered to provide the tilt angles for each image (e.g., -tiltfile), the
  program operates differently.  It automatically produces projections at
  angles around the Z axis, i.e., within the plane of each image.  The
  projections are within a rectangular box that is rotated so its sides are
  parallel to the projection rays.  The size of the box is constrained so that
  it is completely within the image area on the zero-degree view, or within
  the area specified by the -xminmax and -yminmax options.  In addition, the
  box will be made smaller in the direction of projection for images at higher
  tilts by the cosine of the tilt angle, so that it will contain approximately
  the same image features in the different images being projected at a given
  angle.  This tilt foreshortening can be suppressed with the -full option.
  
  Xyzproj uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for pip(1))
  and can still take sequential input interactively.  The following options
  can be specified either as command line arguments (with the -) or one per
  line in a command file or parameter file (without the -).  Options can be
  abbreviated to unique letters; the currently valid abbreviations for short
  names are shown in parentheses.

INSERT OPTION TEXT HERE

  -StandardInput
     Read parameter entries from standard input.


  If there are no command-line arguments, Xyzproj takes sequential input
  the old way, with the following entries:

  Input image file
  
  Output image file
  
  Index coordinates (with numbering starting from 0 in X, Y and Z) of
  the starting and ending X, Y then Z coordinates of the block.  The
  default is the whole image file.  The Z coordinates may be entered
  in inverted order (e.g. 56,34) and should be so entered if the input
  stack is a tomogram that was built in inverted order.

  Axis to tilt around for projections.  Enter X, Y or Z.  The Z axis
  passes perpendicular to the sections in the file.
  
  Starting tilt angle, ending tilt angle, and increment to apply
  between these limits.  All angles are allowed.
  
  Width (x dimension) of the output images.  An appropriate default may
  be selected with /
  
  Data mode for output file.
  
  Scaling factors to apply to the average pixel values: a factor to be
  added to the values, then a factor to multiply by after the addition.
  The default is 0,1, for no scaling.
  
  Value to fill parts of the output image that have no points in the
  block projecting to them  The scaling factors are applied to this
  value.  The default is the mean of the input file.
  
  
  The user must determine the proper scaling in order to output data
  most efficiently (mode 0).  The user must also set the header
  information properly to get the coordinate system to correspond
  to that of the input image file.  This program does not set up the
  header to indicate that the output file is a tilt series.
