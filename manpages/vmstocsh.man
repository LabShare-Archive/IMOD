  VMSTOCSH takes a VMS-style command file from standard input and
  converts it to text suitable for piping to a C shell, on standard
  output.  The command file may contain: lines to run programs, which
  must be preceded by either a $ or a %; comment lines, preceded by
  either $! or #; and entries to the programs that are run, which
  follow the line starting the program, just as in a VMS command file.
  If a command line to run a program is too long, it may be broken 
  into multiple lines by ending each line except the last one with a \.
  If it is necessary to have the command line itself passed to the shell
  as multiple lines, end a line with \\ instead of \.  The command up to
  that point will be output with the \\ converted to a \, and next line
  will be output on a separate line.  In either case, the continuation 
  lines should not start with a $ or %.

  Many C shell commands can be included in the command file as long as they
  are prefixed by $ or %.  Specifically, variables may be defined with set 
  and accessed with $variable.  If a variable needs to appear at the 
  beginning of a line that is an entry to a program, the line should start
  with \$ and this will be converted to $ instead of interpreted as a 
  command line.  This conversion happens only at the beginning of a line.
  
  If there is a command-line argument, that argument will be set up
  as a log file: the text output of each command will be directed
  into this log file.
  
  The easiest way to use this program is through the submbg script
  together with an alias to run submbg in the background, such as

      alias subm 'submfg \!^ & '

  With this alias, if your command file is stuff.com, you can give the
  command "subm stuff" and the file will be executed in background, a 
  log file stuff.log will be created, and you will be notified when the
  job is completed.  Type 'submfg' to see the usage statement for more
  details.
