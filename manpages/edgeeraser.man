  This program erases bad portions of an image near its edges.  It is
  designed to eliminate the sharp borders created when an image
  digitized from film does not fill the entire frame.  The image is
  tapered down to the mean intensity gradually to eliminate the strong
  artifacts that would otherwise occur in a tomographic reconstruction.

  To use the program, first prepare an IMOD model file to indicate
  which edges need to be erased.  Each edge should be specified with a
  separate contour; do not go around a corner with a single contour to
  specify two edges.  Draw the contour just inside the edge of the bad
  region on the image.  The program will erase along that entire side
  of the image, so you should generally draw a contour along the whole
  length of a side.  If you do not, the program will extrapolate from
  the endpoints of a contour.

  The inputs are:

  Input image file

  Output image file, or <Return> to place modified sections back into
  the input file.  USE REPLACEMENT OPTION WITH CAUTION

  Model file

  Distance over which the image should be tapered down to the mean
  intensity, or / to accept the default.  This taper will occur inside
  of the drawn contour, so that the mean intensity is reached at the
  position of the contour.
