.SH NAME
setupcombine \- Create command files for combining dual-axis tomograms
.SH SYNOPSIS
setupcombine [options] -name rootname

.SH DESCRIPTION
Setupcombine generates the command files needed to combine two single-axis
tomograms into one.  These files include solvematch.com, matchvol1.com,
patchcorr.com, matchorwarp.com, volcombine.com, and combine.com, which are all
used for processing in eTomo.  Files matchvol2.com and warpvol.com are also
created and could be used at the command line instead of the matchorwarp
step.

.SS Options
Processchunks uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for pip(1)).
Options can be specified either as command line arguments (with the -)
or one per line in a command file (without the -):
INSERT OPTION TEXT HERE
.TP
.B -StandardInput
Read parameter entries from standard input

.SH FILES
All files are modified from the master files in the $IMOD_DIR/com directory.
Existing copies of the command files will be made into backup files by adding
the extension ~.
