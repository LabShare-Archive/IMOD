.SH NAME
imodqtassist \- Displays html pages through Qt Assistant
.SH SYNOPSIS
imodqtassist [-a | -p adp_file| -k] document_path
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program will run Qt Assistant and send it commands to display html
documents.  The command line arguments indicate where the documents are,
then an individual page is displayed when its name is entered through 
standard input.  
.P
The 
.B document_path
is treated as a path relative to the path in the environment variable IMOD_DIR,
unless the
.B -a
option is entered to indicate that the path is absolute.
If the option
.B -p
is entered along with 
.B adp_file,
the name of an Assistant Document Profile file, then
Qt Assistant will be started with that .adp file.  The 
.B adp_file
is assumed to be relative to the 
.B document_path
unless it is itself an absolute file path specification.
.P
When a line is entered through standard input, the program attempts to display
the page.  If it succeeds, it prints 
.I Page xxx displayed
to standard error and continues waiting for more input.
If it fails to find the page, it prints
.I Page xxx not found
to standard error and also keeps running.
If the
.B adp_file
is not found, it issues
.I WARNING: adp file not found
in addition to the message with regard to the page, but only on the first
request for a page.  If there is actually an error starting Qt Assistant,
the program will exit with a non-zero exit status.  This will not happen until
the first command to display a page.
.P
Enter a line with just a "q" to terminate the program and close the current 
Qt Assistant if one is open.
.P
Each page file entry is assumed to be relative to the 
.B document_path
unless it is itself an absolute file path specification.  There is some
redundancy here if absolute paths are used, since if both the
.B adp_file
and the individual pages are entered with absolute paths, the
.B document_path
becomes irrelevant.
.P
By default, the Assistant sidebar will be started with an argument to hide the
sidebar.  Use the 
.B -k
option to omit this argument and keep the sidebar open if the user had opened
it.
