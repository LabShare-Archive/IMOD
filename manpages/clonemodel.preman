.SH NAME
clonemodel \- clone copies of a model (e.g. an isosurface from a PEET average)
back to the aligned positions and orientations.
.SH SYNOPSIS
clonemodel -at <csvFile> [options] <inputModel> <outputModel>

.SH DESCRIPTION
After aligning and averaging a set of subvolumes with PEET and creating an 
isosurface model of the average, it is often useful to create 
a new model containing multple copies of that isosurface reflecting the  
positions and orientations of the individual aligned particles in the original 
volume. Clonemodel performs this operation. The <inputModel> will be cloned
at locations and orientations specified in <csvFile> and the output
written to <outputModel>. The comma-separated value location/orientation file,
<csvFile>, will typically have been created by running PEET program 
createAlignedModel(1). The <outputModel> will be silently overwritten if it 
already exists. Neither <inputModel> nor <summaryFile> will be modified.

The PEET alignment and average must have been created with "Align Averages 
Vertically" disabled for proper orientations of the cloned models.

While clonemodel is designed for use with a csv location file created
by PEET and a model containing an isosurface rendering of the PEET average,
this is not required. See PEET program createAlignedModel(1) for more 
information on the summary file format.

.SS Options
Clonemodel uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for pip(1)).
Options can be specified either as command line arguments (with the -)
or one per line in a command file (without the -):
