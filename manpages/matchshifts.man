.SH NAME
matchshifts \- Find shift component of transformation between two volumes
.SH SYNOPSIS
matchshifts root_name1 root_name2 NX NY NZ [xf_in] [xf_out]
.SH DESCRIPTION
matchshifts uses cross correlation to complete the process of finding an 
initial transformation between two volumes.  It assumes that solvematch has
found a 3x3 transformation matrix with zero shifts.  It projects each volume
into the X-Z plane, or the central 1024 by 1024 pixels if the volumes are
larger than that.  It rotates the projection of the second volume using
appropriate terms from the transformation matrix, then cross-correlates this
rotated projection with the projection of the first volume to obtain an
initial estimate of shifts in X and Z.  In this way, quite large shifts between
the volumes can be determined.  Next, it extracts a subset from the
center of the first volume and uses matchvol to extract and transform the
approximately corresponding subset of the second volume.  The two subsets are
cross-correlated in 3-D to estimate the shifts in X, Y, and Z.
.SH ARGUMENTS
root_name1 and root_name2 are the root names (without extension .rec) of the
first and second volumes.

NX, NY, NZ are the X, Y, and Z dimensions of the small volume that will be
extracted for 3-D cross-correlation.

An optional sixth argument (xf_in) can be used to specify the name of the
file with the initial 3x3 transformation and zero shifts; otherwise the
file is assumed to be solvezero.xf.

An optional seventh argument (xf_out) can be used to specify the output 
file for the completed transformation; otherwise this file will be solve.xf.
.SH FILES
The program assumes that volumes have the extension ".rec" and, unless there is
a sixth argument, it assumes that the 3x3 transformation is in solvezero.xf.
