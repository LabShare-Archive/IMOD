  Filltomo improves a combined tomogram from a two-axis tilt series by
  replacing pixels in locations where the "matching" tomogram had no data with
  the values from the tomogram that was matched to.  It determines a linear
  scaling between the latter tomogram and the combined tomogram so that the
  intensities will match as well as possible.  It can also be applied to fill
  the tomogram from the axis that is transformed to match, prior to combining.
  
  Three files need to be considered to understand how the program works: 1) The
  tomogram from the axis being matched to, which is the source for replacement
  pixels; 2) the tomogram from the other axis, which needed to be transformed
  into alignment with the first one; 3) the tomogram in which pixels are being
  replaced, which is either the transformation of the second tomogram, or the
  combination of that transformed tomogram with the first axis.

  The decision of whether to replace a pixel is made in up to four stages.
  First, the program determines if the pixel back-transforms to a location
  outside the boundaries of the tomogram from the other axis, in which case it
  was filled with a mean value during the transformation.  Second, if options
  are entered to define the region containing valid data in the tomogram from
  the other axis, then the program can also determine if a pixel
  back-transforms to a location outside that defined region.  Third, if
  options are entered to define the region containing valid data in the
  tomogram being matched to, the program will refrain from replacing pixels
  outside those regions.  Fourth, if regions near the edges are specified
  where the pixels should be replaced regardless of these other criteria, then
  pixels in such regions will be replaced unconditionally.

  There are two different ways to define the region containing valid data in a
  tomogram.  "Valid data" refers to regions where there is a relatively
  complete set of views providing back-projected data, not just to regions
  that have material suitable for correlations.   One way is to create an IMOD
  model with a contour surrounding the area with valid data, when viewing the
  raw tomogram in flipped orientation (perpendicular to the plane of
  section).  The other way is to provide the size of the original unaligned
  image data and the transformations used to align them.  The latter way works
  only if the tomogram is centered on the original image data (i.e., the
  aligned stack was centered on the original stack and neither an X nor a Y
  shift was used in building the tomogram).  If a tomogram is not centered,
  then a boundary model needs to be used instead.

  Specifying the valid data area in the tomogram from the other axis becomes
  increasingly important the greater the rotation of the tilt axis from
  vertical or horizontal, the bigger the shift between the two
  volumes, and the greater the difference between reconstruction
  and raw data size.  In the context of combining data from two axes, however,
  there appears to be no merit in specifying the valid data region in the
  tomogram being matched to.

  Filltomo uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for pip(1))
  but can take input interactively for basic operations, to maintain
  compatibility with old command files. The following options can be specified
  either as command line arguments (with the -) or one per line in a command
  file or parameter file (without the -).  Options can be abbreviated to
  unique letters; the currently valid abbreviations for short names are shown
  in parentheses.

INSERT OPTION TEXT HERE

  -StandardInput
     Read parameter entries from standard input.

  If no command line arguments are entered, inputs are prompted interactively.
  Inputs to the program:
  
  Name of combined tomogram file
  
  Name of the tomogram that was matched TO, which will be the source of
     replacement values
  
  Either the name of the tomogram that was transformed to match, or the
     X, Y and Z dimensions of that file
  
  Name of file containing inverse transformation used by MATCHVOL

  Number of pixels to replace unconditionally along the four sides of the
     tomogram when in flipped orientation.  Enter four numbers, for the number
     of pixels on the left (lower X), right (upper X), bottom (lower Y in
     flipped tomogram), and top (upper Y) edges.
