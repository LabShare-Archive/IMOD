.SH NAME
point2model -\ Convert point listing to IMOD model file
.SH SYNOPSIS
point2model [options] <point_file> <model_file>
.SH DESCRIPTION
Point2model will convert a text file with a simple list of 3D point
coordinates, one per line, to an IMOD model.  The file can be in one of three
forms: each line consisting of X, Y, and Z coordinates; each line having a
contour number followed by the
coordinates; or each line having an object number and a contour number
followed by the coordinates.  The objects and contours can be numbered from
either 1 or 0.  These forms correspond to the different forms that can be
output by the companion program, Model2point(1).  When contour numbers are not
contained in the file, there are options to place points into different 
contours based on the number of points or their Z values.
.P
In addition to options for processing the coordinates, there are several
options for setting properties of the model or objects.  These are provided
to save having to edit a model in 3dmod, a convenience that becomes
significant when models are produced repeatedly at the command line or by a
script.  Other such options could be added easily.
.SS Options
Point2model uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for pip(1)).
Options can be specified either as command line arguments (with the -)
or one per line in a command file (without the -).  Options can be abbreviated
to unique letters; the currently valid abbreviations for short names are shown
in parentheses.
