.SH NAME
transferfid \- make seed model for second axis from fiducials for first axis
.SH SYNOPSIS
transferfid [options] setname
.SH DESCRIPTION
transferfid will make a seed model for tracking fiducials in one axis 
of a dual-axis tilt series, using the fiducial model for the other axis.  It
first finds a pair of views from the two axes that match up well after
an appropriate translation, rotation, and stretching of the view from the
first axis.  It then transforms the corresponding section of the fiducial
model from the first axis by the same amount, and uses Beadtrack to find each
bead on the view from the second axis.  This collection of new positions then
forms the seed model for tracking the second axis.

The program will do all of these operations without any arguments except the
name of the data set if all files
are named appropriately; specifically, if
the command files for beadtrack are named tracka.com and
trackb.com, and the tilt
angles are in files with extension .rawtlt.  
By default, the program will transfer fiducials from the "a" axis
to the "b" axis, in which case it assumes the first fiducial model is named 
setnamea.fid.  However, you can use the 
.B -b
option to transfer from the "b" axis to the "a" axis, in which case the 
existing fiducial model is assumed to be named setnameb.fid.
By default, the program will
search for the best matching pair of views using the 5 views nearest to zero
tilt from each data set.  It will consider rotations by both -90 and +90
degrees, and it will set the bead radius for Beadtrack using the value
in tracka.com.

If the program fails to find the proper alignment between the two axes, this
is probably because the rotation is too far from 90 degrees, and/or the 
translations are too large. 
You can solve this problem by using the 
.B -m
option to
run midas(1) and set the initial rotational
and translational alignment manually.  
When you get into Midas, you may need to rotate
the image by 180 degrees, unless you specify the angle in advance with the
.B -a
option, but this large rotation will not cause problems.  If you find that
the images are mirror images of each other, then you can either mirror one
around the X axis in Midas using the entry in the Edit menu, or
go back to running Transferfid without Midas but with the 
.B
-x
option.

Once the seed model is created, the program analyzes contours in the fiducial
model from the first axis to provide information that is needed when
running solvematch(1).  If the 
.B -c
option is used, then corresponding coordinates of the transferred beads
in the two data sets will be placed into the specified
output file.  This information is sufficient for solvematch(1) to identify
the corresponding fiducials in the final alignment, regardless of whether
some seed points fail to track or some contours are deleted from either 
fiducial model.  If this option is not
used, the program indicates what the correspondence between points
should be when running solvematch(1).  The list of points in A could be in 
error in some cases unless a fiducial coordinate file (setnameafid.xyz) is
also available.  For this reason, it is advisable to run tiltalign(1) at least
once on the first fiducial model before running transferfid.  The lists could
also become erroneous if one of the points in the new seed model fails to 
track, or if fiducials are deleted from either model after running transferfid.
If such changes occur, just enter a small starting subset of points and let
solvematch(1) come up with the rest of the correspondences.

Finding the best pair of views is somewhat time-consuming.  Two ways to
reduce this time are to reduce the number of views in the search with the
.B -n
option and to specify the direction of rotation between the axes with the
.B -a
option.  The latter option alone will save only 15% of the time, because
the program will abandon one rotation direction if it is clearly worse after
considering four pairs of views, or only two if the difference between
directions is very large.

.SS Options
Transferfid uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for pip(1)).
Options can be specified either as command line arguments (with the -)
or one per line in a command file (without the -):

.TP
.B -StandardInput
Read parameter entries from standard input

.SH FILES
Whether or not they fit the default naming conventions, the image files for
fiducial tracking for each tilt series and the first fiducial model
must be present in the current directory.
If the output file already exists, a backup image
of the original is created
with the ~ extension.
