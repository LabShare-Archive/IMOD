  MTLENGTHS computes the lengths, in microns, of contours in
  IMOD models, and produces a list giving the object number and contour
  length for each contour.  This list may be used to generate a
  histogram of lengths with a program such as GENHSTPLT.  One may
  optionally add a certain amount of length to each contour at its
  high Z end, so that the length calculation will include the
  thickness of every section in which a contour appears.
  
  If the reconstruction is from serial sections that were significantly tilted
  during microscopy, the program can adjust for these tilts given the proper
  information.  Prepare a file in which the first line shows the Z value and
  the tilt of the first tilted section (or of the first section, if that one
  was tilted), and each successive line shows the Z value and tilt for each
  section on which tilt was changed.  Z values should occur in ascending
  order.

  If the contours are mainly perpendicular in the model (e.g.,
  microtubules in good cross-section in tilted images), then this simple
  adjustment for tilting is adequate.  However, if trajectories are
  oblique, the program can do a more complex adjustment for the tilting
  if it is given information about the location of the tilt axis in the
  images.  This information consists of the angle of the axis in raw
  images (i.e., the angle of rotation from the vertical to the tilt
  axis), and optionally the list of transformations applied to align the
  raw images.  When the program adjusts for obliqueness, there is a
  potential ambiguity about the sign of the tilt angles.  It thus
  computes lengths both with the tilt angles as given and with their signs
  inverted.  It reports the fraction of line segments that come out
  longer with the angles as given than with the angles inverted.  This
  fraction is referred to as the fraction that are "better", because it
  is assumed that the tilting was done in the direction that reduced the
  obliqueness of the fibers by as much as possible.  This fraction is
  reported for each range of Z values at a single tilt angle, and
  overall.  If the fraction better is less than 0.5, one should rerun the
  program, selecting the option to invert tilt angles.  On this run, the
  angles will be considered to be specified as the negative of the angles
  in the tilt file, and the fraction of segments that are longer with the
  angles as specified will be greater than 0.5.

  These adjustments for tilting are irrelevant for a tomographic
  reconstruction.

  The program can also be provided with an object containing a contour
  that serves as a length marker.  It will report the length of this
  contour both without and with the correction for obliqueness, and with
  the length given for both polarities of the tilt angle.

  If one corrects for obliqueness, there is also an option to produce a
  set of transformations that can be applied to produce the model that
  would have been obtained if the sections had not been tilted.
  Imodtrans(1) or Xfmodel(1) can be used to transform the model.

  The output of the program depends on whether one is correcting for
  obliqeness.  If one is not, the output consists of the object number and
  the length for each MT.  With obliqueness correction, the output consists
  of the object and contour number, the length uncorrected for obliqueness,
  the length with angles as specified, and the length with angles inverted.
  On the final run, with the polarity of angles selected as inverted if
  necessary, the desired lengths will be in the fourth column.

  Mtlengths uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for pip(1))
  and can take input interactively if correction for obliqueness is not
  required.  The following options can be specified either as command line
  arguments (with the -) or one per line in a command file or parameter file
  (without the -).  Options can be abbreviated to unique letters; the
  currently valid abbreviations for short names are shown in parentheses.

INSERT OPTION TEXT HERE

  -StandardInput
     Read parameter entries from standard input.

  For compatibility with older command files, the program will also
  accept input interactively if started with no command line arguments,
  but it will not be able to correct for obliqueness.
  The interactive entries to the program are:
  
  Name of model file
  
  Name of file with tilt information, or Return if none
  
  IF the model has no scaling information in its header, make the
  following three entries:

     Magnification of negatives (without any commas)
  
     Scale, in microns per pixel, at which negatives were digitized
  
     Section thickness in nanometers
  
  Amount to add to the high Z end of each object in order to account
     for section thickness.  For example, enter 1 to allow a section's
     worth of length for each section that an object appears in.

  Name of output file in which to place list of lengths, or Return for
     output to the terminal
  
  List of IMOD objects to exclude from the output, or Return to output
     all objects.
