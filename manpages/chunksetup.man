.SH NAME
chunksetup \- Set up command files to process a volume in chunks
.SH SYNOPSIS
chunksetup [options] <command file> <input file>  <output file>
.SH DESCRIPTION
chunksetup will produce a set of command files to process a 3D image file in
chunks and reassemble the chunks into a single image file.  This procedure can
be used when the processing operation is memory intensive, when it is more 
efficiently done in smaller chunks, or when one wishes to run the operation on
multiple processors. 

To use this procedure, first make a master command file (the first required 
argument) that performs the needed operation, in the format required by
Vmstocsh, as ordinarily run with subm.  The input file for the
operation in this command file should be entered as INPUTFILE, and the final 
output of the operation
as OUTPUTFILE.  (Note that OUTPUTFILE should not be used for the name of the
final output file given on the chunksetup command line.)  The command file may
perform multiple operations and may even
contain INPUTFILE more than once.  If the procedure needs to produce temporary
intermediate files, they 
should be named ending in ".$$" (e.g., chunktemp.$$).  At the end of the 
command file, include lines to remove the specific intermediate files, e.g.
.br
$if (-e chunktemp.$$) rm -f chunktemp.$$
.br
If you are going to run the operation on more than one machine, it is
probably best to
put the files in a machine-specific location such as /usr/tmp.
Alternatively, you can use a more elaborate method for naming temporary files.
Define a variable at the top of your command file:
.br
$set tmpext `hostname`.$$
.br
and end your temporary file names with ".$tmpext".  In this case, you should
remove the files at the end of the command file with statements like:
.br
$if (-e chunktemp.$tmpext) rm -f chunktemp.$tmpext

When chunksetup is run, it first calls Tomopieces, which analyzes the
dimensions of the input file to determine how to chop it up optimally.
It then produces command files for extracting each chunk with Taperoutvol
and processing them,
numbered sequentially with 3-digit numbers.  If the name of the master command
file is "comfile.com", the first command file is comfile-001.com,
INPUTFILE is replaced by comfile-001.in, and OUTPUTFILE is replaced by
comfile-001.out, and similarly for the following files.  Each file contains a
command to remove
comfile-nnn.in, so only the output chunks accumulate as the files are run.
Chunksetup also produces a command file to reassemble the pieces,
comfile-finish.com, which will also delete the output chunks and the command
and log files for each of the chunks.  Finally, it produces a command file,
comfile-all.com, to run all of the chunks in sequence and run the finishing
command file at the end.

You have the option of running the top-level command file using "subm", or
running the individual command files and running the finishing command file
at the end.  If you have multiple processors available with access to the
current directory, you can use
the Processchunks script to run the jobs in parallel on the various processors
or machines, such as with:
.br
processchunks machine_list comfile
.br
where machine_list is a list of the machines to use.

.SS Options
.TP
.B -p <value>
Set the number of pixels of padding on each edge to the given value.  The
default is whatever the default is for Tomopieces (8 pixels).
.TP
.B -o <value>
Set the number of pixels of overlap between the subvolumes to the given value.
The default is 8.
.TP
.B -m <size>
Limit each subvolume to "size" megavoxels.  The default is whatever the
default is for Tomopieces (20 megaVoxels).  
.TP
.B -xm <value>
Set the maximum number of chunks in the X direction to the given value.
The default is -1, which is effectively no limit.  See the man page for
Tomopieces for more details on the choices for maximum number of pieces.
.TP
.B -ym <value>
Set the maximum number of chunks in the Y direction to the given value.
The default is -1, which is effectively no limit.
