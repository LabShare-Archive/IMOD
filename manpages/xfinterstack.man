  This program will transform a model that has been built on one data
  stack so that it will match the coordinates of a different data stack
  that has some sections overlapping the first stack.
  
  To use it, you must first build a model file in which each object
  has two points: the first point placed on a point in the first
  data stack, the second point placed on the exactly corresponding
  point on the same section in the second data stack.  This does not
  require very many objects - 10 should be plenty.
  
  Entries to the program are:
  
  Name of the model file containing the objects with corresponding
  points on an overlapping section.
  
  The Z value (typically the section #) for the points on the section
  in the first data stack.  Only model objects whose first point has
  this Z value will be included
  
  1 for a full report of deviations of points from perfect
  correspondence (see below)
  
  (After the program solves for a transformation):
  Name of the model file to be transformed
  
  0 to transform model from fitting the first stack to fitting the
  second stack, or 1 to transform it from fitting the second stack
  to fitting the first stack.
  
  If the second point in each correspondence object has a different
  Z value from the first point (i.e. if the two data stacks do not have
  congruent Z coordinates), then the Z values of all points in the
  model being transformed will be adjusted by the difference in Z's
  of the correspondence points.

  When the program solves for the transformation between a pair of
  sections, it applies the transformation to the points on the second
  section of the pair, and computes the displacement, or deviation,
  between each point and the corresponding point on the first section
  of the pair.  It then reports the mean deviation for all of the
  points, the maximum deviation, and the object number of the point
  with maximum deviation.  In addition, you may elect to have a
  complete report of the deviations of all points for particularly bad
  sections.  If you choose this option, you control which sections are
  reported by specifying criterion values for the mean and maximum
  deviations; the full report will be made for any sections with mean
  or maximum deviations greater than the respective criteria.
