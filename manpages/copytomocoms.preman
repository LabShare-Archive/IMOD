copytomocoms \- Create command files for generating tomograms
.SH SYNOPSIS
copytomocoms [options] -name rootname

.SH DESCRIPTION
Copytomocoms generates the command files needed for nearly all of the
processing involved in generating a tomogram.  The program is run by the setup
page of eTomo.
.P
There are several ways in which tilt angles can be entered: as a starting and
increment tilt angle, in a file with a list of angles (which can be extracted
from the image file or supplied separately), or directly as a list of angles. 
For each axis, one of these option must be entered for the tilt angle entry,
but only one way can be specified.
.SS Options
Copytomocoms uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page for pip(1)).
Options can be specified either as command line arguments (with the -)
or one per line in a command file (without the -).  Options can be abbreviated
to unique letters; the currently valid abbreviations for short names are shown
in parentheses.

.SH FILES

the extension ~.
