.SH NAME
imodauto \- creates a model from an mrc image stack.
.SH SYNOPSIS
imodauto [options] <MRC image file> <IMOD model file>
.SH DESCRIPTION
imodauto creates an IMOD model from an MRC image stack using
a simple image thresholding.  Both a low and a high threshold may be set; 
contours are drawn around groups of pixels that are below the low threshold
and around pixels above the high threshold.  Image data are read from the file
and scaled to values between 0 and 255, just as when reading into 3dmod(1).
The thresholds may be specified as values either before or after this scaling.
In addition, thresholds may be specified as absolute values or as
multiples of the mean image intensity.  The default behavior is for thresholds
to be interpreted as absolute values after scaling, in which
case they will correspond to thresholds set in the 3dmod autocontouring window.
.P
Typically, you would enter either a low or a high threshold, but not both.
However, if your images have annular regions of pixels, you can get contours
drawn both inside and outside the regions by having the same value for the
low and the high threshold.  The details of making this work right are handled
by the
.B -n
option.  Using that option,
you would enter the threshold once, as either a low or a high threshold, 
depending on whether the features of interest are dark or light.  The 
program will set the other threshold equal to the given one, and follow 
diagonals (connect pixels touching only on their corners) and eliminate 
contours touching edges as appropriate.  For example,
if you enter a high threshold, then imodauto will follow diagonals when
finding areas above threshold, but not when finding 
areas below threshold.  This subtlety is needed
to achieve sensible nested contours.  In this example, the program
will also
eliminate any contours touching the edges of the image area when 
finding areas below threshold; otherwise a large contouring enclosing most of
the image would be produced.

.SS Options
.TP
.B -l <value>
Specifies the low threshold level.
Contours will be generated around pixels that map to levels below the low
threshold level.
The default value is 0, which will give no contours for areas below threshold.
.TP 
.B -h <value>
Specifies the high threshold level.
Contours will be generated around pixels that map to levels above the high
threshold level.
The default value is 255, which will give no contours for areas above
threshold.
.TP
.B -d <value>
Determines how the low and high threshold levels are computed.
The default value is d = 1, in which case the low and high values are used
directly.  When d = 2, the high and low values are treated as 
factors to be applied to the mean of the image file (after loading into the
program).  If an
image file's mean value is 50 and the low value is 0.5 then
the low threshold will be set to 25.  When d = 3, the low and high values 
are factors applied to the mean of each individual section.
.TP
.B -u
Specifies that the entered threshold values are to be interpreted as unscaled,
corresponding to the actual values in the image file.  By default,
threshold values are instead interpreted as scaled values to be applied after
the images are scaled to the range of 0 to 255. 
.TP
.B -f <value>
Determines whether diagonals are followed when finding groups of connected
pixels.  The default value is 0, meaning that diagonals will not be
followed.  With a value of 3, diagonals will always be followed.  With 1 or 2
diagonals will be followed only for areas above the high threshold or below
the low threshold, respectively.
.TP
.B -n
Find inside contours in closed, annular regions.  To use this option, enter
one threshold as appropriate for defining your regions of interest.
.TP
.B -m <value>
Minimum area for each contour, in square pixels.
Any values less than 1 will be treated as 1.
The default value is 10.
.TP
.B -M <value>
Maximum area for each contour, in square pixels.  If this option is not used,
no maximum size will be enforced.
Any value entered should be greater than
the minimum area specified by
.B -m.
.TP
.B -e <value>
Criterion for eliminating contours based on the number of edges of the image
that they touch.  Values from 1 to 4 are meaningful; for example, a value of
2 will eliminate contours that touch 2 or more edges.  The default is zero,
for no selection on the basis of edges touched.
.TP
.B -r <value>  
Resolution for point shaving, in which points are removed when they are closer
than the given distance apart.  The method of point removal will eliminate some
detail and might be useful for smoothing; otherwise, the 
.B -R
option is preferable.
The default value is 0.0, which turns this feature off.
.TP
.B -R <value>  
Resolution or tolerance for point reduction
when generating the final model.  Points are eliminated if they are within this
distance of the lines connecting the remaining points, just as with the -R
option in imodmesh(1) and the resolution feature when autocontouring in
3dmod(1).  This method of point removal will preserve detail as well as
possible, unlike the 
.B
-r
option.
Values in the range 0.25 to 0.5 are often useful.
The default value is 0.0, which turns this feature off.
.TP
.B -s <min,max>
Set the intensity scaling for the image data, so that
.I min
is mapped to 0 and
.I max
is mapped to 255.  The default for these values are the minimum and maximum
from the image file header.
.TP
.B -X <min,max>
Load and model a subset in X from 
.I min
to
.I max,
where the coordinates are numbered from 0.  
.TP
.B -Y <min,max>
Load and model a subset in Y from 
.I min
to
.I max,
where the coordinates are numbered from 0.  If the 
.B -e
option is used with
.B -X
or
.B -Y,
then decisions about contours are made based on the edges of the loaded
subset of the image, not of the full image.
.TP
.B -Z <min,max>
Load and model a subset in Z from 
.I min
to
.I max,
where the coordinates are numbered from 0.
.TP
.B -z <value>
Set the zscale for the model.  The zscale is a factor that compensates for
3 dimensional data that is sampled at a different z resolution than the
x-y plane data.  If the images have 25nm pixels and 100nm z slice size then the
z-scale factor would be 4.0.
.TP
.B -c <r,g,b>
Set the color of the model object by specifying red, green, blue values
separated by commas.  The values can range from 0 to 1 or from 0 to 255;
i.e., 1.0,0.5,0 and 255,128,0 could both be used to specify orange.
.TP
.B -x
Expand areas by one pixel before enclosing them in contours, just as in 
3dmod autocontouring.
.TP
.B -i
Shrink areas by one pixel before enclosing them in contours, just as in 
3dmod autocontouring.
.TP
.B -o
Smooth areas before enclosing them in contours.  As in 3dmod autocontouring, 
this is implemented by expanding then shrinking.
.P
The segmentation used by imodauto is a simple threshold.
Each pixel lying between the low and high thresholds
is thrown out.  Then, the program finds all of the separate areas lying
below the low or above the high threshold.
Groups of pixels with area
greater then the value given by the -M option or area
less then the value given by the -m option are thrown out.
Next, contours are drawn around each remaining area.
.P	
If the -r option has a value greater than 0, then points are eliminated 
from each contour if
they are less than the given distance apart.  After that,
if the -R option has a value greater than 0, points are eliminated
if they are within the given distance from the lines between
remaining points.

If the model file already exists, it becomes a backup file with ~ added to its
name.
