.SH NAME
autofidseed \- Automatically make a seed model for tilt series fiducial tracking
.SH SYNOPSIS
autofidseed [options] data_file
.SH DESCRIPTION
Autofidseed uses a series of other programs to generate a seed model for
tracking tilt series fiducial particles in Beadtrack(1).  Given a desired
number or density of beads to be found, it attempts to select a well
distributed set of good-quality beads.  If beads are on two surfaces, it will
aim for an even distribution of beads on both surfaces.
.P
The program first determines three views around zero tilt that are suitable
for finding beads on.  It aims to have the views be separated by 2 degrees in
tilt.  It runs Imodfindbeads(1) on those views.  If too few beads are
found to achieve the requested number of beads for tracking, it then reruns
Imofindbeads(1) with 5 or 7 initial views instead, in case that brings in more
beads.  (The 
.B -views 
option can be used to make it use only a specific number of views between 3
and 7.)  The program next extracts the beads found on
each view into a separate model and runs Beadtrack(1) independently with each
model as seed.  The beads are typically tracked over 11 views, or possibly
over as few as 7 views if the tilt increment is large.  In each case,
Beadtrack(1) puts out a file with the mean residual and some measures of
elongation for each bead that was tracked.  If beads are to be sorted onto two
surfaces, then Beadtrack(1) also puts out a file with the X, Y, and Z
coordinates of each bead, and Sortbeadsurfs(1) is called to sort the beads
onto two surfaces independently for each starting view.  The tracked models,
the residual/elongation information, and the surface information is then
passed to Pickbestseed(1), which takes everything into account to pick out the
best beads for a seed and produces the final seed model.
.P
The various intermediate files involved are placed in a temporary
directory created in the current directory (see the 
.B -tempdir
option).
Some of them are cleaned up after a run, but
some are kept so that Pickbestseed(1) can be run over again with different
parameters, without having to rerun the bead finding and tracking, and some
are left for information only.  (See the FILES section below for a description
of files.)
Autofidseed retains a file with information about the initial steps so that
it can tell whether the existing temporary files are valid on a new run.  The
default name of this file is
"autofidseed.info" for a single axis data set, or "autofidseed_a.info" or
"autofidseed_b.info" for dual axis data, while the temporary directory
is "autofidseed.dir", "autofidse_a.dir", or "autofidseed_b.dir".
If Autofidseed is run with the option
"-remove 1" it will clean up existing files and start a new run from scratch;
with the option "-remove -1" it will simply clean up files, remove the
temporary directory, and exit.
.P
The program requires at least two arguments, 
.B -track
to indicate a Beadtrack(1) command file, and either
.B -number
or
.B -density
to indicate the desired total number of beads or the density per megapixel (1K
x 1K area).  The command file is
the primary source for
information about the data set and also the basis for the commands used to
track the beads.  Parameters (such as whether beads are white, or Sobel
filtering parameters) should be set in this file before running Autofidseed.
However, the selection for local tracking is ignored; Autofidseed sets up
local tracking depending on the size of the area and the number of beads found
initially.
.P
In typical use, only a few other options should be needed, primarily 
.B -two
to request sorting onto two surfaces, and 
.B -boundary
to specify a model with contours enclosing the regions where beads should be
located.  If Imodfindbeads(1) fails to find a dip in the histogram of peak
strengths or does not find nearly enough beads, the best thing to try is the
.B -guess
option, although it may also be helpful to make a boundary model that excludes
bright areas in the resin outside of a cell.
.P
A major source of problems is a severe imbalance between the number of beads
on two sides.  If the imbalance is big enough, the sorting of beads onto two
surfaces can fail, leading to an inappropriate distribution of points,
and even selection of points that are in clusters.  In other cases, a big
imbalance can lead to selection of the lowest quality beads on the minority
surface, which might be ribosomes instead of gold beads.  In these cases, the
best approach may be to leave off the 
.B -two
option.  The program will add beads from the majority surface, if possible, to
achieve the requested number or density of beads.  This can lead to an
undesirable imbalance in the final seed model, and the 
.B -ratio
option is available to set the allowed ratio between the majority and minority
surfaces.
.P
Large clumps of gold can also create problems at both the tracking steps and
when sorting beads onto two surfaces.  If the problem is primarily in sorting,
with some of the selected beads assigned to the wrong surface, then one remedy
is to exclude bad surface information from particular Beadtrack(1) runs.
Use 3dmodv(1) to examine the sorted models with extension ".sortmod" in the
temporary directory.  If at least one of these models shows proper sorting and
some models do not, use the 
.B -ignore
option to exclude surface information
from the runs with bad sorting.  If that is unsuccessful, you can try
the 
.B -drop
option instead to omit those tracked models completely from
consideration.
.P
Another remedy for problems created by large clumps is to use a boundary model
to exclude them.  Note that it is possible to draw contours just around areas
to exclude, rather than around areas to include, if you use the 
.B -exclude
option.
.P
If there are particles other than gold selected as beads, or if some gold
particles seem not to be found, it may help to examine the ".pkmod" model
produced by Imodfindbeads(s) and left in the temporary directory.  Open the
Bead Fixer in 3dmod to see whether adjusting the threshold upward removes
undesired points; if so you can try the 
.B -peaks
option with a value less than 1 to remove a fraction
of the points with the lowest peak strengths.  To add more points than appear
in this model, use 
.B -peaks
options with a value greater than 1.
.P
When sorting onto two surfaces is requested, the points are still placed in a single
object in the output model, but the ones on the top surface are given a
different surface number so that they can appear in a different color.
Points on the
bottom have the object color, green, and points on the
top appear as magenta, since surface 1 in the object has that color set as a
fine-grained property.
.P
In the output model, seed points have values based on the overall score that
Pickbestseed(1) assigned to them.  The score is a weighted sum of several
factors: the mean residuals in the various tracks, the mean deviation between
multiple tracks of the same bead, the fraction of tracks in which the bead is
missing, and the fraction of points missing from each track.  In addition, 1
is added if a bead is clustered, and 0.3-1 is added if it is elongated.  Good scores
are thus on the order of a mean residual value, and bad ones may be up to 3 or
more.  The value stored in the model file is the inverse of the score so that
low values will be worse, allowing them to be examined in the Bead Fixer in
3dmod(1).  There, you can adjust a slider to turn off points below a threshold
value, and then delete the points below threshold if desired.  The values
there will be on the order of 2-3 for good beads, and less than 1 for the
worse ones.
.SS Options
Autofidseed uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page
for pip(1)).  Options can be specified either as command line
arguments (with the -) or one per line in a command file
(without the -).  Options can be abbreviated to unique letters; the currently
valid abbreviations for short names are shown in parentheses.

.SH FILES
The temporary and intermediate files are named "afsnnn.#.ext", where "nnn" is
a process ID, "#" is the tracked model number, and "ext" is an extension
indicating the contents of file.
.nf
afsnnn.pkmod     - model produced by Imodfindbeads
afsnnn.#.seed    - seed model for tracking from one view
afsnnn.#.track   - model tracked from one view
afsnnn.#.xyzpt   - text file with X/Y/Z coordinates of tracked beads
afsnnn.#.elong   - text file with mean residual and elongation data
afsnnn.#.xyzmod  - 3D model of beads tracked from one view
afsnnn.#.sortmod - 3D model after sorting onto two surfaces
afsnnn.#.surf    - text file with surface assignments
.fi
The ".seed", ".xyzpt", and ".surf" files are cleaned after a run;
the ".track", ".xyzmod", and ".elong" files are needed for rerunning
SortbeadSurfs(1) and Pickbestseed(1), and the  "pkmod" and ".sortmod" files
are left solely for user information.  A copy of the track command file is
also placed in the temporary directory so that the program can make sure that
it has changed.
