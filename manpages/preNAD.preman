.SH NAME
preNAD \- 2D anisotropic diffusion filter for tilt projections
.SH SYNOPSIS
preNAD [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
preNAD is an anisotropic diffusion pre-reconstruction filtering program that
aims to improve image quality for electron microscopy tilt projection
images. The aim of the preNAD program is to improve the image quality of
reconstructed volumes by improving the quality of each tilt projection.
.P
Specifically, a family of Non-Linear Anisotropic Diffusion (NAD) filters
parametrized by the tilt angle is implemented.  The stopping criterion for
iteration in the preNAD filter is based on the Masked Variance
Difference. However, in addition to options to control the algorithm itself,
this version provides the automatic selection of the Masked Variance
Difference using the -MinIterations and -MaxIterations options.
.P
For a more detailed description of the algorithm used in this code, see

Kudryashev, Richard Hall, Harry Quiney and Leann Tilley, "Improving the
quality of electron tomography image volumes using pre-reconstruction
filtering", Journal of Structural Biology, (2012) 180: 132-142.
Please reference this article if you use the filter.

.SS Options
preNAD uses the PIP package for input (see the manual page
for pip(1)).  Options can be specified either as command line
arguments (with the -) or one per line in a command file
(without the -).  Options can be abbreviated to unique letters; the currently
valid abbreviations for short names are shown in parentheses.
