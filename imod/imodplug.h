 * window.  [imx] and [imy] will contain the image position, and [but1], 
 * [but2], and [but3] will indicate the state of the 3 buttons as mapped by 
 * user preferences.  The return value should be the sum of two values: 
 * ^  1 if the plugin handled the mouse event, indicating that no other action
 * should be taken with the event itself by the 3dmod program.
 * ^  2 if the specific calling window should draw itself, without issuing a
 * general program redraw.  If this is not sufficient, the plugin should call
 * ivwRedraw instead of setting this bit.

 *usual.

 * tracking is enabled with ivwTrackMouseForPlugs.

 * Zap window, currently QEvent::Enter, QEvent::Leave, and QEvent::Wheel (which
 * can be cast to QWheelEvent). [imx] and [imy] will contain the image position
 * of the mouse at the time of the event.  The return value should be the sum 
 * of 1 and 2 as for imodPlugMouse, or 0 if the event should be processed as 
 * usual.  It should not be necessary to process Enter and Leave events
 * since the Zap window uses them to manage the removal of a cursor-like extra
