       Imod is typically invoked with one image file, but multi­
       ple image filenames can also be given.  The model filename
       is optional; if imod is called without a model file it
       will create a new model.  The user can load new model
       files using a menu selection once imod is running.  If the
       model file does not already exist, imod will create a new
       model under that name.  The image files may also be omit­
       ted, in which case imod will draw the model on top of
       blank images.  A file containing a list of image files can
       be used in place of the image file names on the command
       line.  If multiple files of different sizes are loaded,
       then the size of the display in each dimension will be
       limited to the minimum size of the various files.  If imod
       is invoked with options but no filenames, then a dialog
       window will open to allow selection of an image file.


       The model must be in the IMOD model format.  Images must
       be in the MRC image format, or in the TIFF format, if the
       appropriate TIFF library is available.  MRC files of
       almost any mode can be read in: byte, 16-bit integer,
       real, complex real, complex integer, or color (RGB).  TIFF
       files may be byte, 16-bit integer, or color; they may be
       organized in strips but not in tiles.  TIFF files with
       various kinds of compression can be read, depending on the
       capabilities of the libraries on the system.  When multi­
       ple files are read in, they do not need to be the same
       mode or even the same format (except that if any file is
       an RGB file, all files must be.)  Whenever a TIFF file, an
       RGB-mode file, or more than one file is specified, images
       are loaded only as they are needed into an image cache.
       This has various implications that are mentioned below.
       Starting a movie through the images will eventually load
       all of the data into the cache, at which point the program
       will perform very similarly to the way it does without the
       cache.  In addition, there is a dialog box to fill the
       cache in various ways, available through the Edit-Image-
       Cache Filler menu entry.  Several other restrictions on
       image files exist.  If any TIFF or RGB-mode files are
       loaded, the image volume cannot be flipped (Y and Z
       exchanged).  The Pixel View window, high-resolution mode
       in the Graph window, and the f and F hotkeys for finding
       pixel values will all give zeros for a TIFF file.  If RGB
       files are loaded, only the Zap and Model View windows can
       be opened.


       Two windows will open upon startup: the Information Window
       and an image window.  The Information Window is the main
       control window; it has a menu bar and has indicators that
       give information about the selected model point and the
       selected graphics voxel.  The bottom of the information
       window also has a status box that shows the progress of
       certain operations while using imod.  While the image is
       loading, the Information Window will report the status of
       the image load.  Selecting the Quit menu item from the
       File menu will cancel the image load.  If the image cache
       feature is used, the image window will open up after the
       first image section is loaded; otherwise, the image window
       won't open until the entire image has been loaded.

       The ZaP Window is the default image display window used by
       imod.  It allows one to view an image at any magnification
       and to pan the image around inside a resizable window.
       Most manual model editing is done within the ZaP Window.


       Additional windows that may be opened via menu selection
       are the Slicer, XYZ, Tumbler, Tilt, Graph, Pixel View, and
       Model View windows.
          The Slicer Window allows one to view slices through the
       3-D image data.  If the image cache is turned on, only
       images in the cache will be displayed in views that con­
       tain data from multiple Z sections.
          The XYZ Image Window displays slices of the 3-D image
       in planes perpendicular to the X,Y and Z axis.
          The Tumbler Window allows one to view a small projected
       view of the area around the current point.
          The Tilt Window allows one to load a tilt image file
       and have it linked to the XYZ Image Window.
          The Graph Window graphs intensity along a given axis or
       along a given contour.
          The Pixel View Window shows the actual pixel values
       from the image file around a given point.
          The Model View Window views the model in a 3D rendering
       while it's being built.



   OOppttiioonnss
       imod will accept the standard Xt toolkit options along
       with the following options:

       --xx <<mmiinn,,mmaaxx>>
       --yy <<mmiinn,,mmaaxx>>
       --zz <<mmiinn[[,,mmaaxx]]>>
              The --xx,, --yy and --zz options can be used to load in a
              sub-area of the original image.  The offsets are
              saved in the model so if a different area is loaded
              the model is automatically transformed to match the
              new sub area.

       --mm     This option overrides the model transformation
              behavior and causes the model to be loaded without
              any transformations.  The default model position
              data will be loaded.

       --xxyyzz   This option causes the default image window to be
              the XYZ window instead of the ZaP window.

       --YY     This option causes the image data to be flipped
              after it has been loaded.  This allows one to model
              image planes that are normal to the Y-axis.  The
              default is to model planes normal to the Z-axis.
              It is possible to flip back and forth between these
              two modeling orientations using the _E_d_i_t _I_m_a_g_e menu
              item _F_l_i_p_.

       --hh --hheellpp
              Print some quick help for imod's command line
              options to the terminal.

       --CC <<vvaalluuee>>
              The --CC option controls the image cache used by
              imod.  The default value is 0 which means imod will
              try to load the entire image into memory.  This
              option can force a given number of images to be
              cached.  Alternatively, one can limit the size of
              the cache in megabytes by entering a value with m
              or M on the end.  For example, --CC 220000MM will limit
              the cache to 200 megabytes.  The reason for using
              this option is either to decrease start up time or
              to view large data sets that can't fit into main
              memory.  This features works best with the ZaP Win­
              dow, which always loads the image that it needs
              into the cache.  Other image windows will only be
              able to access image data that are already within
              the cache.

       --pp <<ffiilleennaammee>>
              Load a file containing a piece list for the input
              image.  This allows one to montage image sections
              together or to view images that are either missing
              sections or have sections out of order.  The piece
              list is an ASCII text file with the following for­
              mat.  There are as many lines as the input image
              has frames (the z dimension of the image file).
              Each line contains three values <X> <Y> and <Z>
              which represent the starting location of each frame
              in the input image stack.  Using the piece list
              option will also turn on the image cache with a
              default size equal to the total number of image z-
              planes that contain data.  The image cache can't be
              turned off, but the size can be changed with the --CC
              option.

       --PP <<nnxx,,nnyy>>
              Create an internal piece list to display images
              from the file in a montage of _n_x by _n_y pieces.  If
              an external piece list file is entered with the --pp
              option, then this option is ignored; with this
              option, montage information in the file header is
              ignored.

       --oo <<nnxx,,nnyy>>
              When creating an internal piece list with the --pp
              option, set the overlap between pieces to _n_x in the
              X direction and _n_y in the Y direction.  Enter nega­
              tive numbers to get space (gutters) between the
              pieces.

       --ff     Load file as individual frames, overriding montage
              information in the image file header.  It is possi­
              ble for an image file to have piece coordinates
              stored in its header rather than in a separate
              piece list file.  Imod will automatically load such
              a file as a montage, so this option is available to
              override this behavior and force loading as indi­
              vidual frames.


       --cc <<vvaalluuee>>
              The --cc option selects a starting color table used
              for displaying image data.  This allows additional
              copies of imod to run and display images with dif­
              ferent contrasts.  The default _v_a_l_u_e is 1 and the
              allowed range is 1-12.  This option is ignored on
              8-bit and RGB graphics displays.  On SGI machines,
              imod attempts to determine the number of other
              imods are already running and selects a color table
              value one higher than this number.  The color table
              can be changed from within imod using the _E_d_i_t
              _I_m_a_g_e menu item _C_o_l_o_r_m_a_p_.

       --rrggbb   Display images in 24-bit color mode rather than
              using a color table.  This option is needed on an
              SGI when trying to display color images, i.e. MRC
              files in RGB-mode or TIFF files containing RGB
              images.

       --GG     Display an RGB-mode MRC file in gray-scale rather
              than in color.  If there are multiple MRC files, if
              the file is specified by an image list, or if the
              file on the command line is a color TIFF file, it
              will be displayed in color regardless of this
              option.

       --ss <<mmiinn,,mmaaxx>>
              The --ss option will scale image intensities linearly
              so that the min and max values will be displayed as
              black (0) and white (255) on the screen.  Without
              this option, intensities are scaled between the
              minimum and maximum intensities in the image file.
              Images can be rescaled after imod is running using
              the _E_d_i_t _I_m_a_g_e menu item _R_e_l_o_a_d_.

              and can be changed using the arrow buttons.  Models
              are a collection of objects, and each object has
              its own display color, drawing style and list of
              contours.  Each contour in turn contains a list of
              points.  When drawing the current contour the
              beginning point is green, the end point is red and
              the current point is yellow.  One can also move
              between the current Object, Contour and Point using
              hot keys in selected image windows.

              The Black and White sliders can be used to adjust
              the contrast and brightness of the input image for
              all the image windows.  A linear intensity ramp is
              made from the black level to the white level.  The
              Function keys also can be used to control the image
              level from other image windows.
              F1, F2  Controls the Black slider level.

              When this box is checked, imod will attempt to
              maintain comparable image contrast when going from
              one section to the next.  It automatically adjusts
              the sliders when you change sections in a ZaP win­
              dow, based on the mean and standard deviation of
              image intensity in the sections.

ZZaaPP WWiinnddooww
       The ZaP window allows one to zoom and pan inside of a
       model window that shows image sections perpendicular to
       the Z-axis.

          To Zoom press the - and = Keys.  To pan, press the left
       mouse button and drag the mouse.  Alternatively, use the
       arrow keys: the ones on the numeric keypad in movie mode,
       or the set of 4 arrow keys in model mode.


          There is a toolbar at the top of the ZaP window that
       controls additional behavior.  Press the help button on
       the toolbar for help.  The space bar on the keyboard can
       toggle the toolbar visibility.

          The mouse buttons are assigned different functions in
       movie and model modes.  The keyboard mm key toggles between
       movie and model modes.  Other sub modes can further change
       the mouse controls.

       Left mouse button
              One can drag the image in the ZaP Window by moving
              the mouse while holding down the left mouse button.
              If the rubber band is on and the button is held
              down while the pointer is near the band, one can
              drag a corner or edge of the band to adjust its
              size.  When the button is clicked in model mode,
              the nearest modeling point is selected.  If no
              points are in proximity to the cursor, then no
              point is selected.  The selected point's color is
              yellow.  In movie mode the current position is
              selected.

       Middle mouse button
              In model mode, this creates a point after the cur­
              rent model point (or before, if the modeling direc­
              tion is set with ii or the toolbar button.)  Holding
              down the middle mouse button will create additional
              points as the mouse moves.  In movie mode, this
              starts the movie through sections in the forward
              direction.  If the rubber band is on and the button
              is held down while the pointer is near the band,
              one can drag the whole band to a new position.

       Right mouse button
              In model mode, the selected point is modified to be
              at the current location.  Holding down the right
              mouse button will cause additional points to be
              moved, until the end of the contour is reached.  If
              the Ctrl key is held down, then this mouse button
              can be used to delete points under the cursor.
              Clicking the button will delete the point(s) at the
              curretn mouse position; holding the button down and
              moving the mouse will delete all of the points that
              the cursor sweeps over.  In movie mode, the right
              mouse button starts the movie through sections in
              the reverse direction.

       Multiple Slicer Windows can be opened. Each Slicer Window
       shows a different slice through a 3-D volume.  Three slid­
       ers are used to select the orientation of the slice by
       setting the angles of rotation of the data volume around
       the X, Y and Z axes.  A small display next to the sliders
       gives a visual cue to the slice location.  One can model
       in the Slicer Window, using the middle mouse button to
       insert a point after the current point, or the right but­
       ton to modify the current point.  The Tool bar on top of
       the Slicer has the following buttons, from left to right.
          The Up and Down arrows adjust the magnification in the
       slicer display window.
          The Show Slice button will draw where the slice inter­
       sects the X- Y- and Z-planes in the XYZ window, and the Z-
       plane in the ZaP window.
          The Lock button will keep the Slicer from changing its
       current position when locked.
          The checkerboard button toggles between nearest neigh­
       bor and slower, cubic interpolation.
          The option menu selects whether the angle sliders,
       depth controls, or just the Slicer image will be dis­
       played.
          The Help button opens up on line help.

       The XYZ window displays three slices: through an XY plane
       in the lower left, through a YZ plane in the lower right,
       and through an XZ plane in the upper left.  Marker lines
       and crosses indicate the position of the current point and
       of the slices within the volume.  Like the ZaP window, it
       can be resized, and the image can be zoomed with hotkeys
       and panned with the left mouse button.  Limited modeling
       capability is available in the XY plane.  One can movie
       through one or more of the planes simultaneously.  In
       addition, the marker lines can be dragged with the mouse
       to riffle through images in a plane.

               Actions in Movie Mode:
                  Clicking the left mouse button will select the
              current point.  In one of the three image planes,
              this will generally change the coordinates dis­
              played in the other two planes.  Clicking in the
              horizontal gutter region occupied by the X marker
              line will change the current X coordinate and the
              plane displayed in the YZ panel.  Clicking in the
              vertical gutter region will select a new Y coordi­
              nate and XZ plane.  Clicking in the upper right
              region will select a new Z coordinate and XY plane,
              as indicated by the crossed marker lines.
                  Dragging with the left mouse button depressed
              will either pan the image within the window or rif­
              fle through one of the planes, depending on where
              the mouse is when the button is first pressed.  If
              it is in one of the image panels, dragging will pan
              the image (provided it is larger than the window.)
              In the horizontal or vertical gutter regions, drag­
              ging will riffle through YZ or XZ planes, respec­
              tively.  In the upper right region, dragging will
              change the XY plane; this is most effective if the
              mouse is moved along the diagonal in this region.
                  Clicking the middle mouse button in one of the
              image panels will start or stop a movie in the for­
              ward direction in that panel.
                  Clicking the right mouse button in one of the
              image panels will start or stop a movie in the
              backward direction in that panel.

               Actions in Model Mode:
                  Clicking the left mouse button near a model
              point in the XY plane will select that point as the
              current model point.  Clicking anywhere else will
              cause the same result as in movie mode.
                  Dragging with the left mouse button is the same
              as in movie mode.
                  Clicking with the middle mouse button in the XY
              plane will add a point to the current contour and
              has no effect elsewhere.
                  Dragging with the middle mouse button depressed
              will add a series of points to the current contour.
                  Clicking with the right mouse button in the XY
              plane will move the current model point to that
              location.

       file requester appears.  One can enter an mrc file name or
       enter an ascii file name with the following format.
            tilt First line is mrc image file name.

       If a file name is given the tilt image is then loaded;
       otherwise the current image in imod is used.  The tilt
       window will draw the current contour.

       This window graphs image intensity along the image X-axis,
       Y-axis, Z-axis or along the current contour.  A histogram
       of image intensities can also be graphed.  The type of
       graph can be chosen by using the option menu located in
       the tool bar.  The [+] and [-] buttons in the tool bar
       adjust the zoom in the drawing area.  The [LOCK] button
       stops the window from tracking the current point.  The
       [RESOLUTION] button toggles between taking data from the
       image buffer and taking data from the file.

       This window shows the model in 3D, continually updated as
       the model is edited.  The window behaves the same as when
       it is started with the imodv command.  See the manual page
       for imodv(1).

       The program will back up the current model to the file
       model_file_name#autosave# every few minutes.  If no model
       file has been saved yet, the name of the autosave file is
       just #autosave#.  The autosave file is eliminated whenever
       the model is saved, and when the program exits normally.
       The IMOD_AUTOSAVE environment variable sets the number of
       seconds between automatic saves.  If it is set to 0 then
       this feature will be disabled.  The first time that you
       save a model file, the existing model file will be renamed
       to model_file_name~, and any existing file by that name
       will be deleted.  This backup file will not be overwritten
       each time that you save thereafter, so that it will pre­
       serve the state of the model when imod was started.

       The IMOD_AUTOSAVE_DIR environment variable can be set to
       specify a directory in which the autosave file will be
       written.  Thus, one can specify a directory on a local
       disk (e.g., /usr/tmp) and avoid the long delays required
       to write a large model to a disk over the network.

       Several features can be controlled from the Contour Type
       window.  One is the surface, which is an optional level of
       organization between contours and objects.  With surfaces,
       one can keep track of, navigate between, and manipulate
       groups of contours without having to use a separate object
       for each group.  Each contour in an object has a surface
       number, which is 0 if surfaces are never employed.  To
       start a new surface, use NN or the New Surf button in the
       Contour Type window to obtain a new, empty contour with
       the new surface number.  Thereafter, each new contour will
       have the same surface number as the previous contour being
       modeled, until a new surface is started again.  The Con­
       tour Type window has controls for moving within and
       between surfaces and for visualizing contours of the cur­
       rent surface.  The Contour Move window has options for
       moving contours from one surface to another or for moving
       an entire surface to a new object.

       The Contour Type window has buttons for controlling two
       kinds of ghost displays.  The Surface Ghost button allows
       one to highlight contours of the current surface.  The
       Section Ghost buttons control the display of ghost con­
       tours from adjacent sections, which is also toggled by the
       g hotkey.

       The Contour Type window has a button for defining individ­
       ual contours as open in an object defined as having closed
       contours.  This is useful for displaying a partially cut
       edge of an object.  See imodmesh(1) for more details.

       This window also has a text box for displaying and editing
       the time index of the current contour.  If you have loaded
       multiple image files and want to model contours at spe­
       cific times (i.e., displayed only on images from a spe­
       cific file), you must first activate time editing with a
       button in the Edit-Object-Type window.  Once this feature
       is selected, newly created contours will be assigned to
       the currently displayed time.

       The Contour Type window also has text boxes in which one
       can enter labels for individual contours and points.
       Finally, it has a text box and slider for assigning a size
       value to an individual point.  While this value can be
       anything, not just a size, it is interpreted as a size
       when the type of the object is scattered points rather
       than contours.

       An image list file can be entered instead of an image file
       on the imod command line.  This ASCII file can specify a
       series of image files that represent different times, so
       that one can step through time as well as X, Y, and Z.  An
       image list file can also be used to specify both an image
       file and a piece list with a single file.  In either case,
       the cache is turned on.  Lines beginning with # are
       treated as comments and ignored.

       The format of the file is:

       IMOD image list               [must be the first line of the file]
       VERSION 0   or   VERSION 1    [must appear somewhere in file]

       To specify a series of files at different times, include a
       series of entries of the form (the second entries for time
       labels are optional, and default label if it is omitted is
       the image filename):

       IMAGE image_filename
       TIME time_label               [The label can be any desired text]

       If the first file might not exist, precede the list of
       images with a line:
       SIZE nx,ny,nz                 [nx,ny,nz are the image dimensions
                                      to be assumed for the first file]

       To specify an image file and piece coordinates, include
       the following:

       IMAGE image_filename
       XYZ                           [on a line by itself]
       x  y  z                       [piece coordinates, one line per section]
        . . .

       Imod will load special plugin libraries that are in the
       directory pointed to by the IMOD_PLUGIN_DIR environment
       variable.  The directories /usr/IMOD/plugins,
       /usr/local/IMOD/plugins, and /usr/freeware/lib/imodplugs/
       are loaded by default if they exist.  To write your own
       plugins, look for the IMOD software development kit on the
       IMOD home page at http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod
